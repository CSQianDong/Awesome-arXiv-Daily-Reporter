**Abstract**: Nutrition estimation is an important component of promoting healthy eating and mitigating diet-related health risks. Despite advances in tasks such as food classification and ingredient recognition, progress in nutrition estimation is limited due to the lack of datasets with nutritional annotations. To address this issue, we introduce FastFood, a dataset with 84,446 images across 908 fast food categories, featuring ingredient and nutritional annotations. In addition, we propose a new model-agnostic Visual-Ingredient Feature Fusion (VIF$^2$) method to enhance nutrition estimation by integrating visual and ingredient features. Ingredient robustness is improved through synonym replacement and resampling strategies during training. The ingredient-aware visual feature fusion module combines ingredient features and visual representation to achieve accurate nutritional prediction. During testing, ingredient predictions are refined using large multimodal models by data augmentation and majority voting. Our experiments on both FastFood and Nutrition5k datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method built in different backbones (e.g., Resnet, InceptionV3 and ViT), which demonstrates the importance of ingredient information in nutrition estimation. this https URL.

**Abstract**: Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for effective Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), enabling robots to interpret and respond to human actions. This study evaluates the ability of a vision-based tactile sensor to classify 15 activities, comparing its performance to an IMU-based data glove. Additionally, we propose a multi-modal framework combining tactile and motion data to leverage their complementary strengths. We examined three approaches: motion-based classification (MBC) using IMU data, tactile-based classification (TBC) with single or dual video streams, and multi-modal classification (MMC) integrating both. Offline validation on segmented datasets assessed each configuration's accuracy under controlled conditions, while online validation on continuous action sequences tested online performance. Results showed the multi-modal approach consistently outperformed single-modality methods, highlighting the potential of integrating tactile and motion sensing to enhance HAR systems for collaborative robotics.

**Authors**: Yatai Ji, Zhengqiu Zhu, Yong Zhao, Beidan Liu, Chen Gao, Yihao Zhao, Sihang Qiu, Yue Hu, Quanjun Yin, Yong Li

**Abstract**: Aerial Visual Object Search (AVOS) tasks in urban environments require Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to autonomously search for and identify target objects using visual and textual cues without external guidance. Existing approaches struggle in complex urban environments due to redundant semantic processing, similar object distinction, and the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To bridge this gap and support the AVOS task, we introduce CityAVOS, the first benchmark dataset for autonomous search of common urban objects. This dataset comprises 2,420 tasks across six object categories with varying difficulty levels, enabling comprehensive evaluation of UAV agents' search capabilities. To solve the AVOS tasks, we also propose PRPSearcher (Perception-Reasoning-Planning Searcher), a novel agentic method powered by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that mimics human three-tier cognition. Specifically, PRPSearcher constructs three specialized maps: an object-centric dynamic semantic map enhancing spatial perception, a 3D cognitive map based on semantic attraction values for target reasoning, and a 3D uncertainty map for balanced exploration-exploitation search. Also, our approach incorporates a denoising mechanism to mitigate interference from similar objects and utilizes an Inspiration Promote Thought (IPT) prompting mechanism for adaptive action planning. Experimental results on CityAVOS demonstrate that PRPSearcher surpasses existing baselines in both success rate and search efficiency (on average: +37.69% SR, +28.96% SPL, -30.69% MSS, and -46.40% NE). While promising, the performance gap compared to humans highlights the need for better semantic reasoning and spatial exploration capabilities in AVOS tasks. This work establishes a foundation for future advances in embodied target search. Dataset and source code are available at this https URL.

# From Seeing to Doing: Bridging Reasoning and Decision for Robotic Manipulation 

**Authors**: Yifu Yuan, Haiqin Cui, Yibin Chen, Zibin Dong, Fei Ni, Longxin Kou, Jinyi Liu, Pengyi Li, Yan Zheng, Jianye Hao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08548)  

**Abstract**: Achieving generalization in robotic manipulation remains a critical challenge, particularly for unseen scenarios and novel tasks. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, while building on top of general Vision-Language Models (VLMs), still fall short of achieving robust zero-shot performance due to the scarcity and heterogeneity prevalent in embodied datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FSD (From Seeing to Doing), a novel vision-language model that generates intermediate representations through spatial relationship reasoning, providing fine-grained guidance for robotic manipulation. Our approach combines a hierarchical data pipeline for training with a self-consistency mechanism that aligns spatial coordinates with visual signals. Through extensive experiments, we comprehensively validated FSD's capabilities in both "seeing" and "doing," achieving outstanding performance across 8 benchmarks for general spatial reasoning and embodied reference abilities, as well as on our proposed more challenging benchmark VABench. We also verified zero-shot capabilities in robot manipulation, demonstrating significant performance improvements over baseline methods in both SimplerEnv and real robot settings. Experimental results show that FSD achieves 54.1% success rate in SimplerEnv and 72% success rate across 8 real-world tasks, outperforming the strongest baseline by 30%.

# SLAG: Scalable Language-Augmented Gaussian Splatting 

**Authors**: Laszlo Szilagyi, Francis Engelmann, Jeannette Bohg  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08124)  

**Abstract**: Language-augmented scene representations hold great promise for large-scale robotics applications such as search-and-rescue, smart cities, and mining. Many of these scenarios are time-sensitive, requiring rapid scene encoding while also being data-intensive, necessitating scalable solutions. Deploying these representations on robots with limited computational resources further adds to the challenge. To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

**Authors**: Ruikun Hou, Babette Bühler, Tim Fütterer, Efe Bozkir, Peter Gerjets, Ulrich Trautwein, Enkelejda Kasneci

**Abstract**: Classroom discourse is an essential vehicle through which teaching and learning take place. Assessing different characteristics of discursive practices and linking them to student learning achievement enhances the understanding of teaching quality. Traditional assessments rely on manual coding of classroom observation protocols, which is time-consuming and costly. Despite many studies utilizing AI techniques to analyze classroom discourse at the utterance level, investigations into the evaluation of discursive practices throughout an entire lesson segment remain limited. To address this gap, our study proposes a novel text-centered multimodal fusion architecture to assess the quality of three discourse components grounded in the Global Teaching InSights (GTI) observation protocol: Nature of Discourse, Questioning, and Explanations. First, we employ attention mechanisms to capture inter- and intra-modal interactions from transcript, audio, and video streams. Second, a multi-task learning approach is adopted to jointly predict the quality scores of the three components. Third, we formulate the task as an ordinal classification problem to account for rating level order. The effectiveness of these designed elements is demonstrated through an ablation study on the GTI Germany dataset containing 92 videotaped math lessons. Our results highlight the dominant role of text modality in approaching this task. Integrating acoustic features enhances the model's consistency with human ratings, achieving an overall Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.384, comparable to human inter-rater reliability (0.326). Our study lays the groundwork for the future development of automated discourse quality assessment to support teacher professional development through timely feedback on multidimensional discourse practices.

# OMGM: Orchestrate Multiple Granularities and Modalities for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval 

**Authors**: Wei Yang, Jingjing Fu, Rui Wang, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Jiang Bian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07879)  

**Abstract**: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.

# Representation Learning with Mutual Influence of Modalities for Node Classification in Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Networks 

**Authors**: Jiafan Li, Jiaqi Zhu, Liang Chang, Yilin Li, Miaomiao Li, Yang Wang, Hongan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.07895)  

**Abstract**: Nowadays, numerous online platforms can be described as multi-modal heterogeneous networks (MMHNs), such as Douban's movie networks and Amazon's product review networks. Accurately categorizing nodes within these networks is crucial for analyzing the corresponding entities, which requires effective representation learning on nodes. However, existing multi-modal fusion methods often adopt either early fusion strategies which may lose the unique characteristics of individual modalities, or late fusion approaches overlooking the cross-modal guidance in GNN-based information propagation. In this paper, we propose a novel model for node classification in MMHNs, named Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Inter-Modal Attention (HGNN-IMA). It learns node representations by capturing the mutual influence of multiple modalities during the information propagation process, within the framework of heterogeneous graph transformer. Specifically, a nested inter-modal attention mechanism is integrated into the inter-node attention to achieve adaptive multi-modal fusion, and modality alignment is also taken into account to encourage the propagation among nodes with consistent similarities across all modalities. Moreover, an attention loss is augmented to mitigate the impact of missing modalities. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the model in the node classification task, providing an innovative view to handle multi-modal data, especially when accompanied with network structures.

**Abstract**: Building multimodal language models is fundamentally challenging: it requires aligning vision and language modalities, curating high-quality instruction data, and avoiding the degradation of existing text-only capabilities once vision is introduced. These difficulties are further magnified in the multilingual setting, where the need for multimodal data in different languages exacerbates existing data scarcity, machine translation often distorts meaning, and catastrophic forgetting is more pronounced. To address the aforementioned challenges, we introduce novel techniques spanning both data and modeling. First, we develop a synthetic annotation framework that curates high-quality, diverse multilingual multimodal instruction data, enabling Aya Vision models to produce natural, human-preferred responses to multimodal inputs across many languages. Complementing this, we propose a cross-modal model merging technique that mitigates catastrophic forgetting, effectively preserving text-only capabilities while simultaneously enhancing multimodal generative performance. Aya-Vision-8B achieves best-in-class performance compared to strong multimodal models such as Qwen-2.5-VL-7B, Pixtral-12B, and even much larger Llama-3.2-90B-Vision. We further scale this approach with Aya-Vision-32B, which outperforms models more than twice its size, such as Molmo-72B and LLaMA-3.2-90B-Vision. Our work advances multilingual progress on the multi-modal frontier, and provides insights into techniques that effectively bend the need for compute while delivering extremely high performance.

**Abstract**: Stance detection is essential for understanding subjective content across various platforms such as social media, news articles, and online reviews. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized stance detection by introducing novel capabilities in contextual understanding, cross-domain generalization, and multimodal analysis. Despite these progressions, existing surveys often lack comprehensive coverage of approaches that specifically leverage LLMs for stance detection. To bridge this critical gap, our review article conducts a systematic analysis of stance detection, comprehensively examining recent advancements of LLMs transforming the field, including foundational concepts, methodologies, datasets, applications, and emerging challenges. We present a novel taxonomy for LLM-based stance detection approaches, structured along three key dimensions: 1) learning methods, including supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, and zero-shot; 2) data modalities, such as unimodal, multimodal, and hybrid; and 3) target relationships, encompassing in-target, cross-target, and multi-target scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation techniques and analyze benchmark datasets and performance trends, highlighting the strengths and limitations of different architectures. Key applications in misinformation detection, political analysis, public health monitoring, and social media moderation are discussed. Finally, we identify critical challenges such as implicit stance expression, cultural biases, and computational constraints, while outlining promising future directions, including explainable stance reasoning, low-resource adaptation, and real-time deployment frameworks. Our survey highlights emerging trends, open challenges, and future directions to guide researchers and practitioners in developing next-generation stance detection systems powered by large language models.

**Abstract**: Charts are ubiquitous as they help people understand and reason with data. Recently, various downstream tasks, such as chart question answering, chart2text, and fact-checking, have emerged. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise in tackling these tasks, but their evaluation is costly and time-consuming, limiting real-world deployment. While using LVLMs as judges to assess the chart comprehension capabilities of other LVLMs could streamline evaluation processes, challenges like proprietary datasets, restricted access to powerful models, and evaluation costs hinder their adoption in industrial settings. To this end, we present a comprehensive evaluation of 13 open-source LVLMs as judges for diverse chart comprehension and reasoning tasks. We design both pairwise and pointwise evaluation tasks covering criteria like factual correctness, informativeness, and relevancy. Additionally, we analyze LVLM judges based on format adherence, positional consistency, length bias, and instruction-following. We focus on cost-effective LVLMs (<10B parameters) suitable for both research and commercial use, following a standardized evaluation protocol and rubric to measure the LVLM judge's accuracy. Experimental results reveal notable variability: while some open LVLM judges achieve GPT-4-level evaluation performance (about 80% agreement with GPT-4 judgments), others struggle (below ~10% agreement). Our findings highlight that state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs can serve as cost-effective automatic evaluators for chart-related tasks, though biases such as positional preference and length bias persist.
