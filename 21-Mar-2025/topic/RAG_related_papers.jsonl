The two mainstream solutions to incorporate memory into the generation process are long-context LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In this paper, we first systematically compare these two types of solutions on three renovated/new datasets and show that (1) long-context solutions, although more expensive, shall be easier to capture the big picture and better answer queries which require considering the memory as a whole; and (2) when the queries concern specific information, RAG solutions shall be more competitive especially when the keywords can be explicitly matched. Therefore, we propose a novel method RAG-Tuned-LLM which fine-tunes a relative small (e.g., 7B) LLM using the data generated following the RAG principles, so it can combine the advantages of both solutions. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that RAG-Tuned-LLM can beat long-context LLMs and RAG methods across a wide range of query types.'}

However, conflicts between parametric knowledge and retrieved context pose challenges, particularly when retrieved information is unreliable or the model's internal knowledge is outdated. In such cases, LLMs struggle to determine whether to rely more on their own parameters or the conflicted context. To address this, we propose **CK-PLUG**, a plug-and-play method for controlling LLMs' reliance on parametric and contextual knowledge. We introduce a novel knowledge consistency metric, Confidence Gain, which detects knowledge conflicts by measuring entropy shifts in token probability distributions after context insertion. CK-PLUG then enables fine-grained control over knowledge preference by adjusting the probability distribution of tokens with negative confidence gain through a single tuning parameter. Experiments demonstrate CK-PLUG's ability to significantly regulate knowledge reliance in counterfactual RAG scenarios while maintaining generation fluency and knowledge accuracy. For instance, on Llama3-8B, memory recall (MR) of RAG response can be adjusted within a broad range (9.9%-71.9%), compared to the baseline of 42.1%. Moreover, CK-PLUG supports adaptive control based on the model's confidence in both internal and external knowledge, achieving consistent performance improvements across various general RAG tasks.

At the same time, they offer a new way of accessing information, mainly through the RAG framework. While there have been notable improvements for the autoregressive models, overcoming hallucination in the generated answers remains a continuous problem. A standard solution is to use commercial LLMs, such as GPT4, to evaluate these algorithms. However, such frameworks are expensive and not very transparent. Therefore, we propose a study which demonstrates the interest of open-weight models for evaluating RAG hallucination. We develop a lightweight approach using smaller, quantized LLMs to provide an accessible and interpretable metric that gives continuous scores for the generated answer with respect to their correctness and faithfulness. This score allows us to question decisions' reliability and explore thresholds to develop a new AUC metric as an alternative to correlation with human judgment."}

These knowledge bases, which play a critical role in enhancing the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to breaches that could compromise sensitive information. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an advanced encryption methodology designed to protect RAG systems from unauthorized access and data leakage. Our approach encrypts both textual content and its corresponding embeddings prior to storage, ensuring that all data remains securely encrypted. This mechanism restricts access to authorized entities with the appropriate decryption keys, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unintended data exposure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our encryption strategy preserves the performance and functionality of RAG pipelines, ensuring compatibility across diverse domains and applications. To validate the robustness of our method, we provide comprehensive security proofs that highlight its resilience against potential threats and vulnerabilities. These proofs also reveal limitations in existing approaches, which often lack robustness, adaptability, or reliance on open-source models. Our findings suggest that integrating advanced encryption techniques into the design and deployment of RAG systems can effectively enhance privacy safeguards. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on improving security measures for AI-driven services and advocates for stricter data protection standards within RAG architectures.'}

RAG has gained interest in radiology, and we previously reported the utility of NotebookLM, an LLM with RAG (RAG-LLM), for lung cancer staging. However, since the comparator LLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its advantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate RAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared NotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment.\nMaterials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging guidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM with REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on CT findings. Staging criteria included TNM classification, local invasion factors, and resectability classification. In REK+/RAG+, retrieval accuracy was quantified based on the sufficiency of retrieved REK excerpts.\nResults: REK+/RAG+ achieved a staging accuracy of 70%, outperforming REK+/RAG- (38%) and REK-/RAG- (35%). For TNM classification, REK+/RAG+ attained 80% accuracy, exceeding REK+/RAG- (55%) and REK-/RAG- (50%). Additionally, REK+/RAG+ explicitly presented retrieved REK excerpts, achieving a retrieval accuracy of 92%.\nConclusion: NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, outperformed its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment, suggesting that RAG may improve LLM's staging accuracy. Furthermore, its ability to retrieve and present REK excerpts provides transparency for physicians, highlighting its applicability for clinical diagnosis and classification."}

Unlike factoid questions, non-factoid questions (NFQs) lack definitive answers and require synthesizing information from multiple sources across various reasoning dimensions. To address these limitations, we introduce Typed-RAG, a type-aware multi-aspect decomposition framework within the RAG paradigm for NFQA. Typed-RAG classifies NFQs into distinct types -- such as debate, experience, and comparison -- and applies aspect-based decomposition to refine retrieval and generation strategies. By decomposing multi-aspect NFQs into single-aspect sub-queries and aggregating the results, Typed-RAG generates more informative and contextually relevant responses. To evaluate Typed-RAG, we introduce Wiki-NFQA, a benchmark dataset covering diverse NFQ types. Experimental results demonstrate that Typed-RAG outperforms baselines, thereby highlighting the importance of type-aware decomposition for effective retrieval and generation in NFQA.
