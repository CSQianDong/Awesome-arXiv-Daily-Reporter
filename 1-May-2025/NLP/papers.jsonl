This study aims to bridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered dialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We introduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews. Additionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life interview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by clinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to assess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation perspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show that TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion: Our system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future enhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions: Our TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare availability.'}

The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them.

This work explores the use of synthetic Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapeutic conversations for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a scalable alternative for training and evaluating clinical models. We systematically compare real and synthetic dialogues using linguistic, structural, and protocol-specific metrics, including turn-taking patterns and treatment fidelity. We also introduce and evaluate PE-specific metrics derived from linguistic analysis and semantic modeling, offering a novel framework for assessing clinical fidelity beyond surface fluency. Our findings show that although synthetic data holds promise for mitigating data scarcity and protecting patient privacy, it can struggle to capture the subtle dynamics of therapeutic interactions. In our dataset, synthetic dialogues match structural features of real-world dialogues (e.g., speaker switch ratio: 0.98 vs. 0.99), however, synthetic interactions do not adequately reflect key fidelity markers (e.g., distress monitoring). We highlight gaps in existing evaluation frameworks and advocate for fidelity-aware metrics that go beyond surface fluency to uncover clinically significant failures.

Nevertheless, the process of HMC presents significant challenges due to its intricate nature, primarily stemming from the contextual aspects of health mentions, such as figurative language and descriptive terminology, rather than explicitly reflecting a personal ailment. To address this problem, we argue that clearer mentions can be achieved through conventional fine-tuning with enhanced parameters of biomedical natural language methods (NLP). In this study, we explore different techniques such as the utilisation of part-of-speech (POS) tagger information, improving on PEFT techniques, and different combinations thereof. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used datasets: RHDM, PHM, and Illness. The results incorporated POS tagger information, and leveraging PEFT techniques significantly improves performance in terms of F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods across all three datasets by utilising smaller models and efficient training. Furthermore, the findings highlight the effectiveness of incorporating POS tagger information and leveraging PEFT techniques for HMC. In conclusion, the proposed methodology presents a potentially effective approach to accurately classifying health mentions in social media posts while optimising the model size and training efficiency.'}

We take inspiration from the prior studies indicating that fake articles are more likely to involve commonsense conflict. Accordingly, we construct commonsense expressions for articles, serving to express potential commonsense conflicts inferred by the difference between extracted commonsense triplet and golden ones inferred by the well-established commonsense reasoning tool COMET. These expressions are then specified for each article as augmentation. Any specific MD methods can be then trained on those commonsense-augmented articles. Besides, we also collect a novel commonsense-oriented dataset named CoMis, whose all fake articles are caused by commonsense conflict. We integrate MD-PCC with various existing MD backbones and compare them across both 4 public benchmark datasets and CoMis.

However, their size presents significant challenges for deployment and inference. This paper investigates the quantization of LLMs, focusing on the LLaMA architecture and its derivatives. We challenge existing assumptions about activation outliers in LLMs and propose a novel mixed-precision quantization approach tailored for LLaMA-like models. Our method leverages the observation that activation spikes in LLaMA architectures are predominantly concentrated in specific projection layers. By applying higher precision (FP16 or FP8) to these layers while quantizing the rest of the model to lower bit-widths, we achieve superior performance compared to existing quantization techniques. Experimental results on LLaMA2, LLaMA3, and Mistral models demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, particularly for 8-bit per-tensor quantization. Our approach outperforms general-purpose methods designed to handle outliers across all architecture types, highlighting the benefits of architecture-specific quantization strategies. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to make LLMs more efficient and deployable, potentially enabling their use in resource-constrained environments.

It was found that the valency of the predicates is the underlying factor behind the trade-off relation between MDD and MHD in Japanese. Native speakers of Japanese regulate the linear complexity and hierarchical complexity through the valency of the predicates, and the relative sizes of MDD and MHD depend on whether the threshold of valency has been reached. Apart from the cognitive load, the valency of the predicates also affects the probability distributions of DD and HD. The effect of the valency of the predicates on the distribution of HD is greater than on that of DD, which leads to differences in their probability distributions and causes the mean of MDD to be lower than that of MHD.'}

Traditional fine-tuning approaches required technical expertise, limiting accessibility for educators with limited technical backgrounds. However, prompt-based tools like ChatGPT have made AES more accessible, enabling educators to obtain machine-generated scores using natural-language prompts (i.e., the prompt-based paradigm). Despite advancements, prior studies have shown bias in fine-tuned LLMs, particularly against disadvantaged groups. It remains unclear whether such biases persist or are amplified in the prompt-based paradigm with cutting-edge tools. Since such biases are believed to stem from the demographic information embedded in pre-trained models (i.e., the ability of LLMs' text embeddings to predict demographic attributes), this study explores the relationship between the model's predictive power of students' demographic attributes based on their written works and its predictive bias in the scoring task in the prompt-based paradigm. Using a publicly available dataset of over 25,000 students' argumentative essays, we designed prompts to elicit demographic inferences (i.e., gender, first-language background) from GPT-4o and assessed fairness in automated scoring. Then we conducted multivariate regression analysis to explore the impact of the model's ability to predict demographics on its scoring outcomes. Our findings revealed that (i) prompt-based LLMs can somewhat infer students' demographics, particularly their first-language backgrounds, from their essays; (ii) scoring biases are more pronounced when the LLM correctly predicts students' first-language background than when it does not; and (iii) scoring error for non-native English speakers increases when the LLM correctly identifies them as non-native."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose Discuss-RAG, a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the medical QA RAG system through collaborative agent-based reasoning.

These limitations contrast with the human ability to continuously learn from new experiences and acquire knowledge throughout life. Most existing approaches add memories either through large context windows or external memory buffers (e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and studies on knowledge injection rarely test scenarios resembling everyday life events. In this work, we introduce a continual learning framework, Memory Embedded in Gated LLMs (MEGa), which injects event memories directly into the weights of LLMs. Each memory is stored in a dedicated set of gated low-rank weights. During inference, a gating mechanism activates relevant memory weights by matching query embeddings to stored memory embeddings. This enables the model to both recall entire memories and answer related questions. On two datasets - fictional characters and Wikipedia events - MEGa outperforms baseline approaches in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our model draws inspiration from the complementary memory system of the human brain.'}

However, the detailed modeling recipe is not disclosed. In this work, we present a systematic training recipe for SLMs that consists of four steps: (1) large-scale mid-training on diverse distilled long-CoT data, (2) supervised fine-tuning on high-quality long-CoT data, (3) Rollout DPO leveraging a carefully curated preference dataset, and (4) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Reward.

Following the recent success of pretraining large models with self-supervised paradigms to enhance EEG classification performance, we propose Large Brain Language Model (LBLM) pretrained to decode silent speech for active BCI. To pretrain LBLM, we propose Future Spectro-Temporal Prediction (FSTP) pretraining paradigm to learn effective representations from unlabeled EEG data.

After pretraining, we finetune our LBLM on downstream tasks, including word-level and semantic-level classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gains of the LBLM over fully-supervised and pretrained baseline models.

Using electronic pathology reports from the British Columbia Cancer Registry (BCCR), three classification scenarios with varying difficulty and data size are evaluated. Models include various SLMs and an LLM. SLMs are evaluated both zero-shot and finetuned; the LLM is evaluated zero-shot only. Finetuning significantly improved SLM performance across all scenarios compared to their zero-shot results. The zero-shot LLM outperformed zero-shot SLMs but was consistently outperformed by finetuned SLMs. Domain-adjacent SLMs generally performed better than the generic SLM after finetuning, especially on harder tasks. Further domain-specific pretraining yielded modest gains on easier tasks but significant improvements on the complex, data-scarce task. The results highlight the critical role of finetuning for SLMs in specialized domains, enabling them to surpass zero-shot LLM performance on targeted classification tasks. Pretraining on domain-adjacent or domain-specific data provides further advantages, particularly for complex problems or limited finetuning data.

They lead to large financial losses, injuries, disabilities, and societal challenges. Accurate and timely accident data is essential for predicting and mitigating these events. This paper presents a novel framework named 'Durghotona GPT' that integrates web scraping and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of comprehensive accident datasets from prominent national dailies in Bangladesh. The authors collected accident reports from three major newspapers: Prothom Alo, Dhaka Tribune, and The Daily Star. The collected news was then processed using the newest available LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama-3. The framework efficiently extracts relevant information, categorizes reports, and compiles detailed datasets. Thus, this framework overcomes limitations of manual data collection methods such as delays, errors, and communication gaps. The authors' evaluation demonstrates that Llama-3, an open-source model, performs comparably to GPT-4. It achieved 89% accuracy in the authors' evaluation. Therefore, it can be considered a cost-effective alternative for similar tasks. The results suggest that the framework developed by the authors can drastically enhance the quality and availability of accident data. As a result, it can support critical applications in traffic safety analysis, urban planning, and public health. The authors also developed an interface for 'Durghotona GPT' for ease of use as part of this paper.

Recent advancements, particularly in web environments, face a critical limitation: their performance will reach a stagnation point during autonomous learning cycles, hindering further improvement. We argue that this stems from limited exploration of the web environment and insufficient exploitation of pre-trained web knowledge in LLMs. To improve the performance of self-improvement, we propose a novel framework that introduces a co-evolving World Model LLM. This world model predicts the next observation based on the current observation and action within the web environment. Leveraging LLMs' pretrained knowledge of abundant web content, the World Model serves dual roles: (1) as a virtual web server generating self-instructed training data to continuously refine the agent's policy, and (2) as an imagination engine during inference, enabling look-ahead simulation to guide action selection for the agent LLM. Experiments in real-world web environments (Mind2Web-Live, WebVoyager, and GAIA-web) show a 10% performance gain over existing self-evolving agents, demonstrating the efficacy and generalizability of our approach, without using any distillation from more powerful close-sourced models.

This paper introduces $Param\\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by transferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated base model with ZERO additional training. By computing the difference between post-trained model weights ($\\Theta_\\text{post}$) and base model weights ($\\Theta_\\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model ($\\Theta'_\\text{base}$), we define $Param\\Delta$ Model as: $\\Theta_{\\text{Param}\\Delta} = \\Theta_\\text{post} - \\Theta_\\text{base} + \\Theta'_\\text{base}$. This approach surprisingly equips the new base model with post-trained capabilities, achieving performance comparable to direct post-training. We did analysis on LLama3, Llama3.1, Qwen, and DeepSeek-distilled models. Results indicate $Param\\Delta$ Model effectively replicates traditional post-training. For example, the $Param\\Delta$ Model obtained from 70B Llama3-inst, Llama3-base, Llama3.1-base models attains approximately 95\\% of Llama3.1-inst model's performance on average. $Param\\Delta$ brings a new perspective on how to fully leverage models in the open-weight community, where checkpoints for base and instruct models are readily available and frequently updated, by providing a cost-free framework to accelerate the iterative cycle of model development."}

Among such methods, OFA (Liu et al., 2024a) proposes a similarity-based subword embedding initialization heuristic that is both effective and efficient. However, OFA restricts target-language token embeddings to be convex combinations of a fixed number of source-language embeddings, which may limit expressiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose HYPEROFA, a hypernetwork-based approach for more adaptive token embedding initialization. The hypernetwork is trained to map from an external multilingual word vector space to the PLMs token embedding space using source-language tokens. Once trained, it can generate flexible embeddings for target-language tokens, serving as a good starting point for continual pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that HYPEROFA consistently outperforms random initialization baseline and matches or exceeds the performance of OFA in both continual pre-training convergence and downstream task performance.

One approach to this question is to compare the cognitive dynamics of humans and large language models (LLMs). However, such a comparison requires a method to quantitatively analyze AI cognitive behavior under controlled conditions. While anecdotal observations suggest that certain prompts can dramatically change LLM behavior, these observations have remained largely qualitative. Here, we propose a two-part framework to investigate this phenomenon: a Transition-Inducing Prompt (TIP) that triggers a rapid shift in LLM responsiveness, and a Transition Quantifying Prompt (TQP) that evaluates this change using a separate LLM. Through controlled experiments, we examined how LLMs react to prompts embedding two semantically distant concepts (e.g., mathematical aperiodicity and traditional crafts)--either fused together or presented separately--by changing their linguistic quality and affective tone. Whereas humans tend to experience heightened engagement when such concepts are meaningfully blended producing a novel concept--a form of conceptual fusion--current LLMs showed no significant difference in responsiveness between semantically fused and non-fused prompts. This suggests that LLMs may not yet replicate the conceptual integration processes seen in human intuition. Our method enables fine-grained, reproducible measurement of cognitive responsiveness, and may help illuminate key differences in how intuition and conceptual leaps emerge in artificial versus human minds.'}

Existing datasets are small, with at most 1,000s of training instances from 11 or fewer GitHub repositories. The procedures to curate such datasets are often complex, necessitating hundreds of hours of human labor; companion execution environments also take up several terabytes of storage, severely limiting their scalability and usability. To address this pain point, we introduce SWE-smith, a novel pipeline for generating software engineering training data at scale. Given any Python codebase, SWE-smith constructs a corresponding execution environment, then automatically synthesizes 100s to 1,000s of task instances that break existing test(s) in the codebase. Using SWE-smith, we create a dataset of 50k instances sourced from 128 GitHub repositories, an order of magnitude larger than all previous works. We train SWE-agent-LM-32B, achieving 40.2% Pass@1 resolve rate on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, state of the art among open source models. We open source SWE-smith (collection procedure, task instances, trajectories, models) to lower the barrier of entry for research in LM systems for automated software engineering.

We term this iterative, multi-turn process codeflow and introduce CodeFlowBench, the first benchmark designed for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' ability to perform codeflow, namely to implement new functionality by reusing existing functions over multiple turns. CodeFlowBench comprises 5258 problems drawn from Codeforces and is continuously updated via an automated pipeline that decomposes each problem into a series of function-level subproblems based on its dependency tree and each subproblem is paired with unit tests. We further propose a novel evaluation framework with tasks and metrics tailored to multi-turn code reuse to assess model performance. In experiments across various LLMs under both multi-turn and single-turn patterns. We observe models' poor performance on CodeFlowBench, with a substantial performance drop in the iterative codeflow scenario. For instance, o1-mini achieves a pass@1 of 20.8% in multi-turn pattern versus 37.8% in single-turn pattern. Further analysis shows that different models excel at different dependency depths, yet all struggle to correctly solve structurally complex problems, highlighting challenges for current LLMs to serve as code generation tools when performing codeflow. Overall, CodeFlowBench offers a comprehensive benchmark and new insights into LLM capabilities for multi-turn, iterative code generation, guiding future advances in code generation tasks."}

The system integrates memory-augmented task planning, enabling robots to execute high-level user commands while tracking past actions. It employs three specialized agents: a routing agent, a task planning agent, and a knowledge base agent, each powered by task-specific LLMs. By leveraging in-context learning, our system avoids the need for explicit model training. RAG enables the system to retrieve context from past interactions, enhancing long-term object tracking. A combination of Grounded SAM and LLaMa3.2-Vision provides robust object detection, facilitating semantic scene understanding for task planning. Evaluation across three household scenarios demonstrates high task planning accuracy and an improvement in memory recall due to RAG. Specifically, Qwen2.5 yields best performance for specialized agents, while LLaMA3.1 excels in routing tasks. The source code is available at: this https URL.'}

Our empirical analysis reveals that the benefit of using Long-CoT varies across problems: while some problems require elaborate reasoning, others show no improvement, or even degraded accuracy. This motivates adaptive reasoning strategies that tailor reasoning depth to the input. However, prior work primarily reduces redundancy within long reasoning paths, limiting exploration of more efficient strategies beyond the Long-CoT paradigm. To address this, we propose a novel two-stage framework for adaptive and efficient reasoning. First, we construct a hybrid reasoning model by merging long and short CoT models to enable diverse reasoning styles. Second, we apply bi-level preference training to guide the model to select suitable reasoning styles (group-level), and prefer concise and correct reasoning within each style group (instance-level). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference costs compared to other baseline approaches, while maintaining performance. Notably, on five mathematical datasets, the average length of reasoning is reduced by more than 50%, highlighting the potential of adaptive strategies to optimize reasoning efficiency in large language models.

Many processes are involved in the glucose regulation, and their interactions are very complex. To better understand those processes we set ourselves a goal to create a Petri net model of the glucose regulation in the whole body. So far we have managed to create a model of glycolysis and synthesis of glucose in the liver, and the general overview models of the glucose regulation in a healthy and diabetic person. In this paper we introduce Petri nets models of insulin secretion in beta cell of the pancreas, and glucagon in the pancreas alpha cells. Those two hormones have mutually opposite effects: insulin preventing hyperglycemia, and glucagon preventing hypoglycemia. Understanding the mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion constitutes the basis for understanding diabetes. We also present a model in which both processes occur together, depending on the blood glucose level. The dynamics of each model is analysed. Additionally, we transform the overall insulin and glucagon secretion system to a Boolean network, following standard transformation rules.'}

Surprisingly, we find that simple object-based visual prompting -- overlaying visual cues (e.g., bounding box, circle) on images -- can significantly mitigate such hallucination; however, different visual prompts (VPs) vary in effectiveness. To address this, we propose Black-Box Visual Prompt Engineering (BBVPE), a framework to identify optimal VPs that enhance LVLM responses without needing access to model internals. Our approach employs a pool of candidate VPs and trains a router model to dynamically select the most effective VP for a given input image. This black-box approach is model-agnostic, making it applicable to both open-source and proprietary LVLMs. Evaluations on benchmarks such as POPE and CHAIR demonstrate that BBVPE effectively reduces object hallucination.'}

To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{SeriesBench}, a benchmark consisting of 105 carefully curated narrative-driven series, covering 28 specialized tasks that require deep narrative understanding. Specifically, we first select a diverse set of drama series spanning various genres. Then, we introduce a novel long-span narrative annotation method, combined with a full-information transformation approach to convert manual annotations into diverse task formats. To further enhance model capacity for detailed analysis of plot structures and character relationships within series, we propose a novel narrative reasoning framework, \\textbf{PC-DCoT}.

We audit several mid-sized open-source LLMs for gender bias using a dataset of 332,044 real-world online job postings. For each posting, we prompt the model to recommend whether an equally qualified male or female candidate should receive an interview callback. We find that most models tend to favor men, especially for higher-wage roles. Mapping job descriptions to the Standard Occupational Classification system, we find lower callback rates for women in male-dominated occupations and higher rates in female-associated ones, indicating occupational segregation. A comprehensive analysis of linguistic features in job ads reveals strong alignment of model recommendations with traditional gender stereotypes. To examine the role of recruiter identity, we steer model behavior by infusing Big Five personality traits and simulating the perspectives of historical figures. We find that less agreeable personas reduce stereotyping, consistent with an agreeableness bias in LLMs. Our findings highlight how AI-driven hiring may perpetuate biases in the labor market and have implications for fairness and diversity within firms.'}

In this paper, we first introduce the background and fundamental concepts related to LLMs and MLLMs, while emphasizing the working principles of MLLMs. Subsequently, we summarize three main directions of application within healthcare: medical reporting, medical diagnosis, and medical treatment. Our findings are based on a comprehensive review of 330 recent papers in this area. We illustrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in these domains by providing specific examples. For data, we present six mainstream modes of data along with their corresponding evaluation benchmarks.

We challenge the above illusion of privacy by proposing a new framework that evaluates re-identification attacks to quantify individual privacy risks upon data release. Our approach shows that seemingly innocuous auxiliary information -- such as routine social activities -- can be used to infer sensitive attributes like age or substance use history from sanitized data. For instance, we demonstrate that Azure's commercial PII removal tool fails to protect 74\\% of information in the MedQA dataset. Although differential privacy mitigates these risks to some extent, it significantly reduces the utility of the sanitized text for downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that current sanitization techniques offer a \\textit{false sense of privacy}, highlighting the need for more robust methods that protect against semantic-level information leakage."}

This corpus-free negative generation contrasts with standard mining techniques. We evaluated this \\textsc{LLM Query $\\rightarrow$ LLM HN} approach against traditional \\textsc{LLM Query $\\rightarrow$ BM25 HN} and \\textsc{LLM Query $\\rightarrow$ CE HN} pipelines using E5-Base and GTE-Base models on several BEIR benchmark datasets.

This demonstrates that our corpus-free negative generation method matches the effectiveness of complex, corpus-dependent mining techniques, offering a potentially simpler and more efficient pathway for training high-performance retrievers without sacrificing results.
