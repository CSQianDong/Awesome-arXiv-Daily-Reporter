**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

**Abstract**: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.

# Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models 

**Authors**: He Du, Bowen Li, Chengxing Xie, Chang Gao, Kai Chen, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13501)  

**Abstract**: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.

# Tandem Training for Language Models 

**Authors**: Robert West, Ashton Anderson, Ece Kamar, Eric Horvitz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13551)  

**Abstract**: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

# Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse 

**Authors**: Liesbeth Allein, Nataly Pineda-Casta√±eda, Andrea Rocci, Marie-Francine Moens  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13417)  

**Abstract**: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

# Personalized Learning Path Planning with Goal-Driven Learner State Modeling 

**Authors**: Joy Jia Yin Lim, Ye He, Jifan Yu, Xin Cong, Daniel Zhang-Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Huiqin Liu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Bin Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13215)  

**Abstract**: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

# Adaptive Reasoning Executor: A Collaborative Agent System for Efficient Reasoning 

**Authors**: Zehui Ling, Deshu Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Xigui Li, Xin Guo, Yuan Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13214)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning. Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

# SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of LLM-based Embodied Agents 

**Authors**: Simon Sinong Zhan, Yao Liu, Philip Wang, Zinan Wang, Qineng Wang, Zhian Ruan, Xiangyu Shi, Xinyu Cao, Frank Yang, Kangrui Wang, Huajie Shao, Manling Li, Qi Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12985)  

**Abstract**: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic, plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

# From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model 

**Authors**: Boyou Chen, Gerui Xu, Zifei Wang, Huizhong Guo, Ananna Ahmed, Zhaonan Sun, Zhen Hu, Kaihan Zhang, Shan Bao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13002)  

**Abstract**: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation, yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving"; distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention.

# DeepPlanner: Scaling Planning Capability for Deep Research Agents via Advantage Shaping 

**Authors**: Wei Fan, Wenlin Yao, Zheng Li, Feng Yao, Xin Liu, Liang Qiu, Qingyu Yin, Yangqiu Song, Bing Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12979)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage. As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL), planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens, revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

# Bee: A High-Quality Corpus and Full-Stack Suite to Unlock Advanced Fully Open MLLMs 

**Authors**: Yi Zhang, Bolin Ni, Xin-Sheng Chen, Heng-Rui Zhang, Yongming Rao, Houwen Peng, Qinglin Lu, Han Hu, Meng-Hao Guo, Shi-Min Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13795)  

**Abstract**: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

# Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis 

**Authors**: Xinlei Wang, Mingtian Tan, Jing Qiu, Junhua Zhao, Jinjin Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13029)  

**Abstract**: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition, trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.

# Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation 

**Authors**: Qun Ma, Xiao Xue, Xuwen Zhang, Zihan Zhao, Yuwei Guo, Ming Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13195)  

**Abstract**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

# RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering 

**Authors**: Junhong Shen, Mu Cai, Bo Hu, Ameet Talwalkar, David A Ross, Cordelia Schmid, Alireza Fathi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13756)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

# From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Imran Khan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12864)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

# FIRST: Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit for Scientific AI Model Access 

**Authors**: Aditya Tanikanti, Benoit C√¥t√©, Yanfei Guo, Le Chen, Nickolaus Saint, Ryan Chard, Ken Raffenetti, Rajeev Thakur, Thomas Uram, Ian Foster, Michael E. Papka, Venkatram Vishwanath  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13724)  

**Abstract**: We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure. Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run parallel inference workloads via an OpenAI-compliant API on private, secure environments. This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed across federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports multiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains "hot" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch and interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private, secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial cloud infrastructure.

# Unlocking Public Catalogues: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for ICD Coding of German Tumor Diagnoses 

**Authors**: Stefan Lenz, Lakisha Ortiz Rosario, Georg Vollmar, Arsenij Ustjanzew, Fatma Alickovic, Thomas Kindler, Torsten Panholzer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13624)  

**Abstract**: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from this https URL.

# In-Browser LLM-Guided Fuzzing for Real-Time Prompt Injection Testing in Agentic AI Browsers 

**Authors**: Avihay Cohen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13543)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents integrated into web browsers (often called agentic AI browsers) offer powerful automation of web tasks. However, they are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These attacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent operates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real time.

# MedREK: Retrieval-Based Editing for Medical LLMs with Key-Aware Prompts 

**Authors**: Shujun Xia, Haokun Lin, Yichen Wu, Yinan Zhou, Zixuan Li, Zhongwei Wan, Xingrun Xing, Yefeng Zheng, Xiang Li, Caifeng Shan, Zhenan Sun, Quanzheng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13500)  

**Abstract**: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at this https URL.

# ConsintBench: Evaluating Language Models on Real-World Consumer Intent Understanding 

**Authors**: Xiaozhe Li, TianYi Lyu, Siyi Yang, Yuxi Gong, Yizhao Yang, Jinxuan Huang, Ligao Zhang, Zhuoyi Huang, Qingwen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13499)  

**Abstract**: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

# Document Intelligence in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey 

**Authors**: Weishi Wang, Hengchang Hu, Zhijie Zhang, Zhaochen Li, Hongxin Shao, Daniel Dahlmeier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13366)  

**Abstract**: Document AI (DAI) has emerged as a vital application area, and is significantly transformed by the advent of large language models (LLMs). While earlier approaches relied on encoder-decoder architectures, decoder-only LLMs have revolutionized DAI, bringing remarkable advancements in understanding and generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of DAI's evolution, highlighting current research attempts and future prospects of LLMs in this field. We explore key advancements and challenges in multimodal, multilingual, and retrieval-augmented DAI, while also suggesting future research directions, including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and its implications for both academic and practical applications.

# MADREC: A Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent for Explainable and Adaptive Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jiin Park, Misuk Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13371)  

**Abstract**: Recent attempts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems have gained momentum, but most remain limited to simple text generation or static prompt-based inference, failing to capture the complexity of user preferences and real-world interactions. This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.

# Protect: Towards Robust Guardrailing Stack for Trustworthy Enterprise LLM Systems 

**Authors**: Karthik Avinash, Nikhil Pareek, Rishav Hada  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13351)  

**Abstract**: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

# LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification 

**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-Gonz√°lez, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Mart√≠n, David Camacho  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13302)  

**Abstract**: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

**Abstract**: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed, manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering, MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction, and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective, non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient approach to mechanistic activation steering.

# Stable LLM Ensemble: Interaction between Example Representativeness and Diversity 

**Authors**: Junichiro Niimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13143)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

# Multi-Label Clinical Text Eligibility Classification and Summarization System 

**Authors**: Surya Tejaswi Yerramsetty, Almas Fathimah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13115)  

**Abstract**: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec) and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

# On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models 

**Authors**: Anej Svete, Ashish Sabharwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13117)  

**Abstract**: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.

# LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA) for Mitigating Bias in AI Systems 

**Authors**: Sai Suhruth Reddy Karri, Yashwanth Sai Nallapuneni, Laxmi Narasimha Reddy Mallireddy, Gopichand G  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13202)  

**Abstract**: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.

# Program of Thoughts for Financial Reasoning: Leveraging Dynamic In-Context Examples and Generative Retrieval 

**Authors**: Subhendu Khatuya, Shashwat Naidu, Pawan Goyal, Niloy Ganguly  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13157)  

**Abstract**: Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.

# TRUSTVIS: A Multi-Dimensional Trustworthiness Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Ruoyu Sun, Da Song, Jiayang Song, Yuheng Huang, Lei Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13106)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods, TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering targeted model improvements.

# Deliberate Lab: A Platform for Real-Time Human-AI Social Experiments 

**Authors**: Crystal Qian, Vivian Tsai, Michael Behr, Nada Hussein, L√©o Laugier, Nithum Thain, Lucas Dixon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13011)  

**Abstract**: Social and behavioral scientists increasingly aim to study how humans interact, collaborate, and make decisions alongside artificial intelligence. However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped: (1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a 12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195 experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making and human-centered AI.

# ESI: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification via Semantic-preserving Intervention for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Weinan Zhang, Longxuan Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13103)  

**Abstract**: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

# Max It or Miss It: Benchmarking LLM On Solving Extremal Problems 

**Authors**: Binxin Gao, Jingjun Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12997)  

**Abstract**: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

# InferA: A Smart Assistant for Cosmological Ensemble Data 

**Authors**: Justin Z. Tam, Pascal Grosset, Divya Banesh, Nesar Ramachandra, Terece L. Turton, James Ahrens  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12920)  

**Abstract**: Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation which comprises several terabytes.

# FaStFACT: Faster, Stronger Long-Form Factuality Evaluations in LLMs 

**Authors**: Yingjia Wan, Haochen Tan, Xiao Zhu, Xinyu Zhou, Zhiwei Li, Qingsong Lv, Changxuan Sun, Jiaqi Zeng, Yi Xu, Jianqiao Lu, Yinhong Liu, Zhijiang Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12839)  

**Abstract**: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment. Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous pipelines.
Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data is available at this https URL.

# Adaptive Generation of Bias-Eliciting Questions for LLMs 

**Authors**: Robin Staab, Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12857)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior.

# Repurposing Annotation Guidelines to Instruct LLM Annotators: A Case Study 

**Authors**: Kon Woo Kim, Rezarta Islamaj, Jin-Dong Kim, Florian Boudin, Akiko Aizawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12835)  

**Abstract**: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks. Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and automated annotation.

# Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions 

**Authors**: Thao Pham  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12826)  

**Abstract**: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial. While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance. Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting: all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate), while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

# MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning 

**Authors**: Rajarshi Ghosh, Abhay Gupta, Hudson McBride, Anurag Vaidya, Faisal Mahmood  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12818)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes. We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each (69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care. MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning stability in medical AI.

# A\textsuperscript{2}FM: An Adaptive Agent Foundation Model for Tool-Aware Hybrid Reasoning 

**Authors**: Qianben Chen, Jingyi Cao, Jiayu Zhang, Tianrui Qin, Xiaowan Li, King Zhu, Dingfeng Shi, He Zhu, Minghao Liu, Xiaobo Liang, Ge Zhang, Jian Yang, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Wangchunshu Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12838)  

**Abstract**: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves 13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

# Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers 

**Authors**: Hieu Le Duc, Leo Liberti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12829)  

**Abstract**: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].

# Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study 

**Authors**: Soheil Hashtarkhani, Rezaur Rashid, Christopher L Brett, Lokesh Chinthala, Fekede Asefa Kumsa, Janet A Zink, Robert L Davis, David L Schwartz, Arash Shaban-Nejad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12813)  

**Abstract**: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

# Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models for Persian in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning 

**Authors**: Mahdi Cherakhloo, Arash Abbasi, Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz, Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12807)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms, with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing. This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs, providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a benchmark for future model development.

# AutoCode: LLMs as Problem Setters for Competitive Programming 

**Authors**: Shang Zhou, Zihan Zheng, Kaiyuan Liu, Zeyu Shen, Zerui Cheng, Zexing Chen, Hansen He, Jianzhu Yao, Huanzhi Mao, Qiuyang Mang, Tianfu Fu, Beichen Li, Dongruixuan Li, Wenhao Chai, Zhuang Liu, Aleksandra Korolova, Peter Henderson, Natasha Jaques, Pramod Viswanath, Saining Xie, Jingbo Shang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12803)  

**Abstract**: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts; target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than 81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

# Retrieval-in-the-Chain: Bootstrapping Large Language Models for Generative Retrieval 

**Authors**: Yingchen zhang, Ruqing zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Wenjun Peng, Sen Li, Fuyu Lv  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13095)  

**Abstract**: Generative retrieval (GR) is an emerging paradigm that leverages large language models (LLMs) to autoregressively generate document identifiers (docids) relevant to a given query. Prior works have focused on leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs to improve GR, while overlooking that their reasoning capabilities could likewise help. This raises a key question: Can explicit reasoning benefit GR? To investigate, we first conduct a preliminary study where an LLM is prompted to generate free-form chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before performing constrained docid decoding. Although this method outperforms standard GR, the generated reasoning tends to be verbose and poorly aligned with the docid space. These limitations motivate the development of a reasoning mechanism better tailored to GR.
Therefore, we propose Reason-for-Retrieval (R4R), a reasoning-augmented framework for GR that converts free-form CoT reasoning into a compact, structured format, and iteratively refines the reasoning during the retrieval process. R4R augments an existing GR method by leveraging a reasoning-capable LLM that has been instruction-tuned for GR. At inference time, R4R first uses the LLM to generate an initial structured reasoning; then the same LLM alternates between (i) constrained decoding with the chosen GR method to produce candidate docids and (ii) updating the reasoning based on retrieval results to improve the next round. R4R does not require additional models or training, and instead a single LLM serves as both the reasoning generator and the retriever. Extensive experiments on Natural Questions, MS MARCO, and a real-world item-search benchmark validate the effectiveness of R4R.

# ReMindRAG: Low-Cost LLM-Guided Knowledge Graph Traversal for Efficient RAG 

**Authors**: Yikuan Hu, Jifeng Zhu, Lanrui Tang, Chen Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13193)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge graphs (KGs), with their structured representation capabilities, offer promising avenue for enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, leading to the development of KG-RAG systems. Nevertheless, existing methods often struggle to achieve effective synergy between system effectiveness and cost efficiency, leading to neither unsatisfying performance nor excessive LLM prompt tokens and inference time. To this end, this paper proposes REMINDRAG, which employs an LLM-guided graph traversal featuring node exploration, node exploitation, and, most notably, memory replay, to improve both system effectiveness and cost efficiency. Specifically, REMINDRAG memorizes traversal experience within KG edge embeddings, mirroring the way LLMs "memorize" world knowledge within their parameters, but in a train-free manner. We theoretically and experimentally confirm the effectiveness of REMINDRAG, demonstrating its superiority over existing baselines across various benchmark datasets and LLM backbones. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Beyond Static LLM Policies: Imitation-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation 

**Authors**: Yi Zhang, Lili Xie, Ruihong Qiu, Jiajun Liu, Sen Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13229)  

**Abstract**: Recommender systems (RecSys) have become critical tools for enhancing user engagement by delivering personalized content across diverse digital platforms. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines. The code can be found at this https URL.

# HyMiRec: A Hybrid Multi-interest Learning Framework for LLM-based Sequential Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jingyi Zhou, Cheng Chen, Kai Zuo, Manjie Xu, Zhendong Fu, Yibo Chen, Xu Tang, Yao Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13738)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for sequential recommendation. However, current LLM-based approaches face critical limitations in modeling users' long-term and diverse interests. First, due to inference latency and feature fetching bandwidth constraints, existing methods typically truncate user behavior sequences to include only the most recent interactions, resulting in the loss of valuable long-range preference signals. Second, most current methods rely on next-item prediction with a single predicted embedding, overlooking the multifaceted nature of user interests and limiting recommendation diversity. To address these challenges, we propose HyMiRec, a hybrid multi-interest sequential recommendation framework, which leverages a lightweight recommender to extracts coarse interest embeddings from long user sequences and an LLM-based recommender to captures refined interest embeddings. To alleviate the overhead of fetching features, we introduce a residual codebook based on cosine similarity, enabling efficient compression and reuse of user history embeddings. To model the diverse preferences of users, we design a disentangled multi-interest learning module, which leverages multiple interest queries to learn disentangles multiple interest signals adaptively, allowing the model to capture different facets of user intent. Extensive experiments are conducted on both benchmark datasets and a collected industrial dataset, demonstrating our effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, online A/B testing shows that HyMiRec brings consistent improvements in real-world recommendation systems.

# LLM-guided Hierarchical Retrieval 

**Authors**: Nilesh Gupta, Wei-Cheng Chang, Ngot Bui, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Inderjit S. Dhillon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13217)  

**Abstract**: Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex, multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy, context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline. Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.

# RAG Meets Temporal Graphs: Time-Sensitive Modeling and Retrieval for Evolving Knowledge 

**Authors**: Jiale Han, Austin Cheung, Yubai Wei, Zheng Yu, Xusheng Wang, Bing Zhu, Yi Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13590)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge is inherently time-sensitive and continuously evolves over time. Although current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enrich LLMs with external knowledge, they largely ignore this temporal nature. This raises two challenges for RAG. First, current RAG methods lack effective time-aware representations. Same facts of different time are difficult to distinguish with vector embeddings or conventional knowledge graphs. Second, most RAG evaluations assume a static corpus, leaving a blind spot regarding update costs and retrieval stability as knowledge evolves. To make RAG time-aware, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (TG-RAG), which models external corpora as a bi-level temporal graph consisting of a temporal knowledge graph with timestamped relations and a hierarchical time graph. Multi-granularity temporal summaries are generated for each time node to capture both key events and broader trends at that time. The design supports incremental updates by extracting new temporal facts from the incoming corpus and merging them into the existing graph. The temporal graph explicitly represents identical facts at different times as distinct edges to avoid ambiguity, and the time hierarchy graph allows only generating reports for new leaf time nodes and their ancestors, ensuring effective and efficient updates. During inference, TG-RAG dynamically retrieves a subgraph within the temporal and semantic scope of the query, enabling precise evidence gathering. Moreover, we introduce ECT-QA, a time-sensitive question-answering dataset featuring both specific and abstract queries, along with a comprehensive evaluation protocol designed to assess incremental update capabilities of RAG systems. Extensive experiments show that TG-RAG significantly outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in handling temporal knowledge and incremental updates.

# Maximum In-Support Return Modeling for Dynamic Recommendation with Language Model Prior 

**Authors**: Xiaocong Chen, Siyu Wang, Lina Yao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12816)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning-based recommender systems (RLRS) offer an effective way to handle sequential recommendation tasks but often face difficulties in real-world settings, where user feedback data can be sub-optimal or sparse. In this paper, we introduce MDT4Rec, an offline RLRS framework that builds on the Decision Transformer (DT) to address two major challenges: learning from sub-optimal histories and representing complex user-item interactions. First, MDT4Rec shifts the trajectory stitching procedure from the training phase to action inference, allowing the system to shorten its historical context when necessary and thereby ignore negative or unsuccessful past experiences. Second, MDT4Rec initializes DT with a pre-trained large language model (LLM) for knowledge transfer, replaces linear embedding layers with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for more flexible representations, and employs Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently fine-tune only a small subset of parameters. We evaluate MDT4Rec on five public datasets and in an online simulation environment, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.

# How Sampling Affects the Detectability of Machine-written texts: A Comprehensive Study 

**Authors**: Matthieu Dubois, Fran√ßois Yvon, Pablo Piantanida  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13681)  

**Abstract**: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\% in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37 decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework this https URL

# Confidence-Based Response Abstinence: Improving LLM Trustworthiness via Activation-Based Uncertainty Estimation 

**Authors**: Zhiqi Huang, Vivek Datla, Chenyang Zhu, Alfy Samuel, Daben Liu, Anoop Kumar, Ritesh Soni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13750)  

**Abstract**: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints. Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the 16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable, architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

# FreshTab: Sourcing Fresh Data for Table-to-Text Generation Evaluation 

**Authors**: Krist√Ωna Onderkov√°, Ond≈ôej Pl√°tek, Zdenƒõk Kasner, Ond≈ôej Du≈°ek  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13598)  

**Abstract**: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model (LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more challenging.

# GAPS: A Clinically Grounded, Automated Benchmark for Evaluating AI Clinicians 

**Authors**: Xiuyuan Chen, Tao Sun, Dexin Su, Ailing Yu, Junwei Liu, Zhe Chen, Gangzeng Jin, Xin Wang, Jingnan Liu, Hansong Xiao, Hualei Zhou, Dongjie Tao, Chunxiao Guo, Minghui Yang, Yuan Xia, Jing Zhao, Qianrui Fan, Yanyun Wang, Shuai Zhen, Kezhong Chen, Jun Wang, Zewen Sun, Heng Zhao, Tian Guan, Shaodong Wang, Geyun Chang, Jiaming Deng, Hongchengcheng Chen, Kexin Feng, Ruzhen Li, Jiayi Geng, Changtai Zhao, Jun Wang, Guihu Lin, Peihao Li, Liqi Liu, Peng Wei, Jian Wang, Jinjie Gu, Ping Wang, Fan Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13734)  

**Abstract**: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding (cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness), \textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood, creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth (G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

# Sparse Subnetwork Enhancement for Underrepresented Languages in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Daniil Gurgurov, Josef van Genabith, Simon Ostermann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13580)  

**Abstract**: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment, and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

# Attention Illuminates LLM Reasoning: The Preplan-and-Anchor Rhythm Enables Fine-Grained Policy Optimization 

**Authors**: Yang Li, Zhichen Dong, Yuhan Sun, Weixun Wang, Shaopan Xiong, Yijia Luo, Jiashun Liu, Han Lu, Jiamang Wang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng, Junchi Yan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13554)  

**Abstract**: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics: 1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

# MemoTime: Memory-Augmented Temporal Knowledge Graph Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning 

**Authors**: Xingyu Tan, Xiaoyang Wang, Xiwei Xu, Xin Yuan, Liming Zhu, Wenjie Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13614)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities, but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However, existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time, enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse. Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

# Make an Offer They Can't Refuse: Grounding Bayesian Persuasion in Real-World Dialogues without Pre-Commitment 

**Authors**: Buwei He, Yang Liu, Zhaowei Zhang, Zixia Jia, Huijia Wu, Zhaofeng He, Zilong Zheng, Yipeng Kang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13387)  

**Abstract**: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs. Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language (FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP) baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP performance comparable to that of larger models.

# Beyond Single-Reward: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization for Machine Translation 

**Authors**: Hao Wang, Linlong Xu, Heng Liu, Yangyang Liu, Xiaohu Zhao, Bo Zeng, Liangying Shao, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13434)  

**Abstract**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT), but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair, Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against leading proprietary LLMs.

# D-SMART: Enhancing LLM Dialogue Consistency via Dynamic Structured Memory And Reasoning Tree 

**Authors**: Xiang Lei, Qin Li, Min Zhang, Min Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13363)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic, structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

# Doing Things with Words: Rethinking Theory of Mind Simulation in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Agnese Lombardi, Alessandro Lenci  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13395)  

**Abstract**: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4 can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation: GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution, suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning. Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions. These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation frameworks.

# Beyond Correctness: Rewarding Faithful Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Zhichao Xu, Zongyu Wu, Yun Zhou, Aosong Feng, Kang Zhou, Sangmin Woo, Kiran Ramnath, Yijun Tian, Xuan Qi, Weikang Qiu, Lin Lee Cheong, Haibo Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13272)  

**Abstract**: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents, covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness, think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA benchmarks.

# Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive TTS Models 

**Authors**: Yizhou Peng, Yukun Ma, Chong Zhang, Yi-Wen Chao, Chongjia Ni, Bin Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13293)  

**Abstract**: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech, undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control. Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and intelligibility.

# Are Proverbs the New Pythian Oracles? Exploring Sentiment in Greek Sayings 

**Authors**: Katerina Korre, John Pavlopoulos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13341)  

**Abstract**: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment. Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs, (2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment, (3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece negative sentiment is more prevalent.

# Grounding Long-Context Reasoning with Contextual Normalization for Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Jiamin Chen, Yuchen Li, Xinyu Ma, Xinran Chen, Xiaokun Zhang, Shuaiqiang Wang, Chen Ma, Dawei Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13191)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e., context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization, a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for better long-context reasoning.

# DSCD: Large Language Model Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding 

**Authors**: Ming Dong, Jinkui Zhang, Bolong Zheng, Xinhui Tu, Po Hu, Tingting He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13183)  

**Abstract**: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding (DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning. DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

# In-Distribution Steering: Balancing Control and Coherence in Language Model Generation 

**Authors**: Arthur Vogels, Benjamin Wong, Yann Choho, Annabelle Blangero, Milan Bhan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13285)  

**Abstract**: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world applications.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13291)  

**Abstract**: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.

# CoT-Evo: Evolutionary Distillation of Chain-of-Thought for Scientific Reasoning 

**Authors**: Kehua Feng, Keyan Ding, Zhihui Zhu, Lei Liang, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13166)  

**Abstract**: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models. To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

# Do You Get the Hint? Benchmarking LLMs on the Board Game Concept 

**Authors**: Ine Gevers, Walter Daelemans

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper, we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically, we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch, French, and Spanish) compared to English.

# Mirror Speculative Decoding: Breaking the Serial Barrier in LLM Inference 

**Authors**: Nikhil Bhendawade, Kumari Nishu, Arnav Kundu, Chris Bartels, Minsik Cho, Irina Belousova

**Abstract**: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation: increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods (Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics, we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to 66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving 2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

# I Am Aligned, But With Whom? MENA Values Benchmark for Evaluating Cultural Alignment and Multilingual Bias in LLMs 

**Authors**: Pardis Sadat Zahraei, Ehsaneddin Asgari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13154)  

**Abstract**: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings (neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language, "Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

# Putting on the Thinking Hats: A Survey on Chain of Thought Fine-tuning from the Perspective of Human Reasoning Mechanism 

**Authors**: Xiaoshu Chen, Sihang Zhou, Ke Liang, Duanyang Yuan, Haoyuan Chen, Xiaoyu Sun, Linyuan Meng, Xinwang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13170)  

**Abstract**: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking, intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception, etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory. Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens. Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub repository \footnote{this https URL} that continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster progress in this rapidly evolving field.

# On the Role of Preference Variance in Preference Optimization 

**Authors**: Jiacheng Guo, Zihao Li, Jiahao Qiu, Yue Wu, Mengdi Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13022)  

**Abstract**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs). However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model, evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection. Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

# A Multilingual, Large-Scale Study of the Interplay between LLM Safeguards, Personalisation, and Disinformation 

**Authors**: Jo√£o A. Leite, Arnav Arora, Silvia Gargova, Jo√£o Luz, Gustavo Sampaio, Ian Roberts, Carolina Scarton, Kalina Bontcheva  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12993)  

**Abstract**: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324 disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

# The Curious Case of Curiosity across Human Cultures and LLMs 

**Authors**: Angana Borah, Rada Mihalcea  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12943)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST (CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference (content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs, narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing its importance for future NLP research.

# Who's Asking? Evaluating LLM Robustness to Inquiry Personas in Factual Question Answering 

**Authors**: Nil-Jana Akpinar, Chia-Jung Lee, Vanessa Murdock, Pietro Perona  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12925)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully, grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise, or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for robustness evaluation.

# EduDial: Constructing a Large-scale Multi-turn Teacher-Student Dialogue Corpus 

**Authors**: Shouang Wei, Min Zhang, Xin Lin, Bo Jiang, Zhongxiang Dai, Kun Kuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12899)  

**Abstract**: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250 dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning, zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions. Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance. Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all metrics. The code is available at this https URL.

# Addressing the alignment problem in transportation policy making: an LLM approach 

**Authors**: Xiaoyu Yan, Tianxing Dai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13139)  

**Abstract**: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in transportation decision-making.

# Two Heads Are Better Than One: Audio-Visual Speech Error Correction with Dual Hypotheses 

**Authors**: Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sungwoo Cho, Joon Son Chung, Hoirin Kim, Se-Young Yun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13281)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER) framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework, DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR hypotheses at this https URL.
