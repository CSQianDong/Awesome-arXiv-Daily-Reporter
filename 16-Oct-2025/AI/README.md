**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging, open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated, step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor. Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation dynamics.

# From Refusal to Recovery: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Generative AI Guardrails 

**Authors**: Ravi Pandya, Madison Bland, Duy P. Nguyen, Changliu Liu, Jaime Fernández Fisac, Andrea Bajcsy

**Abstract**: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem: harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii) proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

# Training LLM Agents to Empower Humans 

**Authors**: Evan Ellis, Vivek Myers, Jens Tuyls, Sergey Levine, Anca Dragan, Benjamin Eysenbach  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13709)  

**Abstract**: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data, providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline. Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31% higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or verifiable rewards.

# A Modal Logic for Temporal and Jurisdictional Classifier Models 

**Authors**: Cecilia Di Florio, Huimin Dong, Antonino Rotolo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13691)  

**Abstract**: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal system.

# Tandem Training for Language Models 

**Authors**: Robert West, Ashton Anderson, Ece Kamar, Eric Horvitz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13551)  

**Abstract**: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents, with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

# A Methodology for Assessing the Risk of Metric Failure in LLMs Within the Financial Domain 

**Authors**: William Flanagan, Mukunda Das, Rajitha Ramanyake, Swaunja Maslekar, Meghana Manipuri, Joong Ho Choi, Shruti Nair, Shambhavi Bhusan, Sanjana Dulam, Mouni Pendharkar, Nidhi Singh, Vashisth Doshi, Sachi Shah Paresh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13524)  

**Abstract**: As Generative Artificial Intelligence is adopted across the financial services industry, a significant barrier to adoption and usage is measuring model performance. Historical machine learning metrics can oftentimes fail to generalize to GenAI workloads and are often supplemented using Subject Matter Expert (SME) Evaluation. Even in this combination, many projects fail to account for various unique risks present in choosing specific metrics. Additionally, many widespread benchmarks created by foundational research labs and educational institutions fail to generalize to industrial use. This paper explains these challenges and provides a Risk Assessment Framework to allow for better application of SME and machine learning Metrics

# Confidence as a Reward: Transforming LLMs into Reward Models 

**Authors**: He Du, Bowen Li, Chengxing Xie, Chang Gao, Kai Chen, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13501)  

**Abstract**: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500 and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms existing self-training methods.

# Mobile Coverage Analysis using Crowdsourced Data 

**Authors**: Timothy Wong, Tom Freeman, Joseph Feehily  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13459)  

**Abstract**: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and, crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly within complex urban environments.

# Assessing LLM Reasoning Through Implicit Causal Chain Discovery in Climate Discourse 

**Authors**: Liesbeth Allein, Nataly Pineda-Castañeda, Andrea Rocci, Marie-Francine Moens  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13417)  

**Abstract**: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce. Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit, mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

# Learnable Game-theoretic Policy Optimization for Data-centric Self-explanation Rationalization 

**Authors**: Yunxiao Zhao, Zhiqiang Wang, Xingtong Yu, Xiaoli Li, Jiye Liang, Ru Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13393)  

**Abstract**: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns, lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT), which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

# SAJA: A State-Action Joint Attack Framework on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Weiqi Guo, Guanjun Liu, Ziyuan Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13262)  

**Abstract**: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack (SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance. We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its attacks.

# An Analytical Framework to Enhance Autonomous Vehicle Perception for Smart Cities 

**Authors**: Jalal Khan, Manzoor Khan, Sherzod Turaev, Sumbal Malik, Hesham El-Sayed, Farman Ullah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13230)  

**Abstract**: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

# EvoTest: Evolutionary Test-Time Learning for Self-Improving Agentic Systems 

**Authors**: Yufei He, Juncheng Liu, Yue Liu, Yibo Li, Tri Cao, Zhiyuan Hu, Xinxing Xu, Bryan Hooi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13220)  

**Abstract**: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection, memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines. On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance, outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win any.

# Personalized Learning Path Planning with Goal-Driven Learner State Modeling 

**Authors**: Joy Jia Yin Lim, Ye He, Jifan Yu, Xin Cong, Daniel Zhang-Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Huiqin Liu, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Bin Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13215)  

**Abstract**: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning paths that align with individual goals. While large language models (LLMs) show potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack mechanisms for goal-aligned planning. We introduce Pxplore, a novel framework for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

# Adaptive Reasoning Executor: A Collaborative Agent System for Efficient Reasoning 

**Authors**: Zehui Ling, Deshu Chen, Yichi Zhang, Yuchen Liu, Xigui Li, Xin Guo, Yuan Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13214)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning. Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

# Emotional Cognitive Modeling Framework with Desire-Driven Objective Optimization for LLM-empowered Agent in Social Simulation 

**Authors**: Qun Ma, Xiao Xue, Xuwen Zhang, Zihan Zhao, Yuwei Guo, Ming Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13195)  

**Abstract**: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution, desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

# Repairing Reward Functions with Human Feedback to Mitigate Reward Hacking 

**Authors**: Stephane Hatgis-Kessell, Logan Mondal Bhamidipaty, Emma Brunskill  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13036)  

**Abstract**: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches, requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

# Toward Reasoning-Centric Time-Series Analysis 

**Authors**: Xinlei Wang, Mingtian Tan, Jing Qiu, Junhua Zhao, Jinjin Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13029)  

**Abstract**: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition, trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex real-world environments.

# From Narratives to Probabilistic Reasoning: Predicting and Interpreting Drivers' Hazardous Actions in Crashes Using Large Language Model 

**Authors**: Boyou Chen, Gerui Xu, Zifei Wang, Huizhong Guo, Ananna Ahmed, Zhaonan Sun, Zhen Hu, Kaihan Zhang, Shan Bao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13002)  

**Abstract**: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation, yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%, surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving"; distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and intervention.

# SENTINEL: A Multi-Level Formal Framework for Safety Evaluation of LLM-based Embodied Agents 

**Authors**: Simon Sinong Zhan, Yao Liu, Philip Wang, Zinan Wang, Qineng Wang, Zhian Ruan, Xiangyu Shi, Xinyu Cao, Frank Yang, Kangrui Wang, Huajie Shao, Manling Li, Qi Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12985)  

**Abstract**: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic, plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

# DeepPlanner: Scaling Planning Capability for Deep Research Agents via Advantage Shaping 

**Authors**: Wei Fan, Wenlin Yao, Zheng Li, Feng Yao, Xin Liu, Liang Qiu, Qingyu Yin, Yangqiu Song, Bing Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12979)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage. As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL), planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens, revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

# From Literal to Liberal: A Meta-Prompting Framework for Eliciting Human-Aligned Exception Handling in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Imran Khan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12864)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue, SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks, classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT. Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning. This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning, paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

# Generative Universal Verifier as Multimodal Meta-Reasoner 

**Authors**: Xinchen Zhang, Xiaoying Zhang, Youbin Wu, Yanbin Cao, Renrui Zhang, Ruihang Chu, Ling Yang, Yujiu Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13804)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

**Abstract**: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

# Provably Invincible Adversarial Attacks on Reinforcement Learning Systems: A Rate-Distortion Information-Theoretic Approach 

**Authors**: Ziqing Lu, Lifeng Lai, Weiyu Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13792)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial attack, such as state observation attacks.

**Authors**: Devvrit Khatri, Lovish Madaan, Rishabh Tiwari, Rachit Bansal, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Manzil Zaheer, Inderjit S. Dhillon, David Brandfonbrener, Rishabh Agarwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13786)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets, there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum, and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long achieved in pre-training.

# InternVLA-M1: A Spatially Guided Vision-Language-Action Framework for Generalist Robot Policy 

**Authors**: Xinyi Chen, Yilun Chen, Yanwei Fu, Ning Gao, Jiaya Jia, Weiyang Jin, Hao Li, Yao Mu, Jiangmiao Pang, Yu Qiao, Yang Tian, Bin Wang, Bolun Wang, Fangjing Wang, Hanqing Wang, Tai Wang, Ziqin Wang, Xueyuan Wei, Chao Wu, Shuai Yang, Jinhui Ye, Junqiu Yu, Jia Zeng, Jingjing Zhang, Jinyu Zhang, Shi Zhang, Feng Zheng, Bowen Zhou, Yangkun Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13778)  

**Abstract**: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots. Code and models are available at this https URL.

# Scaling Vision Transformers for Functional MRI with Flat Maps 

**Authors**: Connor Lane, Daniel Z. Kaplan, Tanishq Mathew Abraham, Paul S. Scotti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13768)  

**Abstract**: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at this https URL.

# RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering 

**Authors**: Junhong Shen, Mu Cai, Bo Hu, Ameet Talwalkar, David A Ross, Cordelia Schmid, Alireza Fathi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13756)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

# Multi-Scale High-Resolution Logarithmic Grapher Module for Efficient Vision GNNs 

**Authors**: Mustafa Munir, Alex Zhang, Radu Marculescu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13740)  

**Abstract**: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

# FIRST: Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit for Scientific AI Model Access 

**Authors**: Aditya Tanikanti, Benoit Côté, Yanfei Guo, Le Chen, Nickolaus Saint, Ryan Chard, Ken Raffenetti, Rajeev Thakur, Thomas Uram, Ian Foster, Michael E. Papka, Venkatram Vishwanath  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13724)  

**Abstract**: We present the Federated Inference Resource Scheduling Toolkit (FIRST), a framework enabling Inference-as-a-Service across distributed High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. FIRST provides cloud-like access to diverse AI models, like Large Language Models (LLMs), on existing HPC infrastructure. Leveraging Globus Auth and Globus Compute, the system allows researchers to run parallel inference workloads via an OpenAI-compliant API on private, secure environments. This cluster-agnostic API allows requests to be distributed across federated clusters, targeting numerous hosted models. FIRST supports multiple inference backends (e.g., vLLM), auto-scales resources, maintains "hot" nodes for low-latency execution, and offers both high-throughput batch and interactive modes. The framework addresses the growing demand for private, secure, and scalable AI inference in scientific workflows, allowing researchers to generate billions of tokens daily on-premises without relying on commercial cloud infrastructure.

# NExT-OMNI: Towards Any-to-Any Omnimodal Foundation Models with Discrete Flow Matching 

**Authors**: Run Luo, Xiaobo Xia, Lu Wang, Longze Chen, Renke Shan, Jing Luo, Min Yang, Tat-Seng Chua  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13721)  

**Abstract**: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal this http URL this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

# Dedelayed: Deleting remote inference delay via on-device correction 

**Authors**: Dan Jacobellis, Mateen Ulhaq, Fabien Racapé, Hyomin Choi, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13714)  

**Abstract**: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms. Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain aligned with the current world state.

# Simplicial Embeddings Improve Sample Efficiency in Actor-Critic Agents 

**Authors**: Johan Obando-Ceron, Walter Mayor, Samuel Lavoie, Scott Fujimoto, Aaron Courville, Pablo Samuel Castro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13704)  

**Abstract**: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization; unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in runtime speed.

# MVCustom: Multi-View Customized Diffusion via Geometric Latent Rendering and Completion 

**Authors**: Minjung Shin, Hyunin Cho, Sooyeon Go, Jin-Hwa Kim, Youngjung Uh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13702)  

**Abstract**: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models. However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.

# CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas 

**Authors**: Zian Li, Muhan Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13669)  

**Abstract**: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.

# Axial Neural Networks for Dimension-Free Foundation Models 

**Authors**: Hyunsu Kim, Jonggeon Park, Joan Bruna, Hongseok Yang, Juho Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13665)  

**Abstract**: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems. Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining for foundation models.

# Time Series Foundation Models: Benchmarking Challenges and Requirements 

**Authors**: Marcel Meyer, Sascha Kaltenpoth, Kevin Zalipski, Oliver Müller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13654)  

**Abstract**: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new, principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data, to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

# Closing the Gap Between Text and Speech Understanding in LLMs 

**Authors**: Santiago Cuervo, Skyler Seto, Maureen de Seyssel, Richard He Bai, Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly, Zakaria Aldeneh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13632)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap: the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text. Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text. Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

# Unlocking Public Catalogues: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for ICD Coding of German Tumor Diagnoses 

**Authors**: Stefan Lenz, Lakisha Ortiz Rosario, Georg Vollmar, Arsenij Ustjanzew, Fatma Alickovic, Thomas Kindler, Torsten Panholzer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13624)  

**Abstract**: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from this https URL.

# The Role of Computing Resources in Publishing Foundation Model Research 

**Authors**: Yuexing Hao, Yue Huang, Haoran Zhang, Chenyang Zhao, Zhenwen Liang, Paul Pu Liang, Yue Zhao, Lichao Sun, Saleh Kalantari, Xiangliang Zhang, Marzyeh Ghassemi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13621)  

**Abstract**: Cutting-edge research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) requires considerable resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), data, and human resources. In this paper, we evaluate of the relationship between these resources and the scientific advancement of foundation models (FM). We reviewed 6517 FM papers published between 2022 to 2024, and surveyed 229 first-authors to the impact of computing resources on scientific output. We find that increased computing is correlated with national funding allocations and citations, but our findings don't observe the strong correlations with research environment (academic or industrial), domain, or study methodology. We advise that individuals and institutions focus on creating shared and affordable computing opportunities to lower the entry barrier for under-resourced researchers. These steps can help expand participation in FM research, foster diversity of ideas and contributors, and sustain innovation and progress in AI. The data will be available at: this https URL

# Message Passing on the Edge: Towards Scalable and Expressive GNNs 

**Authors**: Pablo Barceló, Fabian Jogl, Alexander Kozachinskiy, Matthias Lanzinger, Stefan Neumann, Cristóbal Rojas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13615)  

**Abstract**: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures, EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more computationally efficient.

# NOSA: Native and Offloadable Sparse Attention 

**Authors**: Yuxiang Huang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13602)  

**Abstract**: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing, significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced, which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput, especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention baseline (InfLLM-V2).

# Subject Roles in the EU AI Act: Mapping and Regulatory Implications 

**Authors**: Nicola Fabiano  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13591)  

**Abstract**: The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) establishes the world's first comprehensive regulatory framework for AI systems through a sophisticated ecosystem of interconnected subjects defined in Article 3. This paper provides a structured examination of the six main categories of actors - providers, deployers, authorized representatives, importers, distributors, and product manufacturers - collectively referred to as "operators" within the regulation. Through examination of these Article 3 definitions and their elaboration across the regulation's 113 articles, 180 recitals, and 13 annexes, we map the complete governance structure and analyze how the AI Act regulates these subjects. Our analysis reveals critical transformation mechanisms whereby subjects can assume different roles under specific conditions, particularly through Article 25 provisions ensuring accountability follows control. We identify how obligations cascade through the supply chain via mandatory information flows and cooperation requirements, creating a distributed yet coordinated governance system. The findings demonstrate how the regulation balances innovation with the protection of fundamental rights through risk-based obligations that scale with the capabilities and deployment contexts of AI systems, providing essential guidance for stakeholders implementing the AI Act's requirements.

**Abstract**: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities for cre- ating dynamic non-player characters (NPCs) in gaming environments, enabling both func- tional task execution and persona-consistent dialogue generation. In this paper, we (Tu_Character_lab) report our participation in the Commonsense Persona-Grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025 Round 2, which eval- uates agents across three tracks: task-oriented dialogue, context-aware dialogue, and their integration. Our approach combines two complementary strategies: (i) lightweight prompting techniques in the API track, including a Deflanderization prompting method to suppress excessive role-play and improve task fidelity, and (ii) fine-tuned large models in the GPU track, leveraging Qwen3-14B with supervisedfinetuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA). Our best submissions ranked 2nd on Task 1, 2nd on Task 3 (API track), and 4th on Task 3 (GPU track).

**Authors**: Peng Di, Faqiang Chen, Xiao Bai, Hongjun Yang, Qingfeng Li, Ganglin Wei, Jian Mou, Feng Shi, Keting Chen, Peng Tang, Zhitao Shen, Zheng Li, Wenhui Shi, Junwei Guo, Hang Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13561)  

**Abstract**: The escalating complexity of modern software imposes an unsustainable operational burden on Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, demanding AI-driven automation that can emulate expert diagnostic reasoning. Existing solutions, from traditional AI methods to general-purpose multi-agent systems, fall short: they either lack deep causal reasoning or are not tailored for the specialized, investigative workflows unique to SRE. To address this gap, we present OpenDerisk, a specialized, open-source multi-agent framework architected for SRE. OpenDerisk integrates a diagnostic-native collaboration model, a pluggable reasoning engine, a knowledge engine, and a standardized protocol (MCP) to enable specialist agents to collectively solve complex, multi-domain problems. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that OpenDerisk significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. This effectiveness is validated by its large-scale production deployment at Ant Group, where it serves over 3,000 daily users across diverse scenarios, confirming its industrial-grade scalability and practical impact.

**Authors**: David Freire-Obregón, José Salas-Cáceres, Javier Lorenzo-Navarro, Oliverio J. Santana, Daniel Hernández-Sosa, Modesto Castrillón-Santana  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13557)  

**Abstract**: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

# In-Browser LLM-Guided Fuzzing for Real-Time Prompt Injection Testing in Agentic AI Browsers 

**Authors**: Avihay Cohen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13543)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents integrated into web browsers (often called agentic AI browsers) offer powerful automation of web tasks. However, they are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions hidden in a webpage deceive the agent into unwanted actions. These attacks can bypass traditional web security boundaries, as the AI agent operates with the user privileges across sites. In this paper, we present a novel fuzzing framework that runs entirely in the browser and is guided by an LLM to automatically discover such prompt injection vulnerabilities in real time.

# K-Merge: Online Continual Merging of Adapters for On-device Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Donald Shenaj, Ondrej Bohdal, Taha Ceritli, Mete Ozay, Pietro Zanuttigh, Umberto Michieli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13537)  

**Abstract**: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of on-device settings.

# Narrow Operator Models of Stellarator Equilibria in Fourier Zernike Basis 

**Authors**: Timo Thun, Rory Conlin, Dario Panici, Daniel Böckenhoff  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13521)  

**Abstract**: Numerical computation of the ideal Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium magnetic field is at the base of stellarator optimisation and provides the starting point for solving more sophisticated Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) like transport or turbulence models. Conventional approaches solve for a single stationary point of the ideal MHD equations, which is fully defined by three invariants and the numerical scheme employed by the solver. We present the first numerical approach that can solve for a continuous distribution of equilibria with fixed boundary and rotational transform, varying only the pressure invariant. This approach minimises the force residual by optimising parameters of multilayer perceptrons (MLP) that map from a scalar pressure multiplier to the Fourier Zernike basis as implemented in the modern stellarator equilibrium solver DESC.

# UniME-V2: MLLM-as-a-Judge for Universal Multimodal Embedding Learning 

**Authors**: Tiancheng Gu, Kaicheng Yang, Kaichen Zhang, Xiang An, Ziyong Feng, Yueyi Zhang, Weidong Cai, Jiankang Deng, Lidong Bing  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13515)  

**Abstract**: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

# Offline and Online KL-Regularized RLHF under Differential Privacy 

**Authors**: Yulian Wu, Rushil Thareja, Praneeth Vepakomma, Francesco Orabona  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13512)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$ local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of $\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log (N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space $\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF. As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source code at: this https URL.

# MedREK: Retrieval-Based Editing for Medical LLMs with Key-Aware Prompts 

**Authors**: Shujun Xia, Haokun Lin, Yichen Wu, Yinan Zhou, Zixuan Li, Zhongwei Wan, Xingrun Xing, Yefeng Zheng, Xiang Li, Caifeng Shan, Zhenan Sun, Quanzheng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13500)  

**Abstract**: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1) representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at this https URL.

# ConsintBench: Evaluating Language Models on Real-World Consumer Intent Understanding 

**Authors**: Xiaozhe Li, TianYi Lyu, Siyi Yang, Yuxi Gong, Yizhao Yang, Jinxuan Huang, Ligao Zhang, Zhuoyi Huang, Qingwen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13499)  

**Abstract**: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

# DistilCLIP-EEG: Enhancing Epileptic Seizure Detection Through Multi-modal Learning and Knowledge Distillation 

**Authors**: Zexin Wang, Lin Shi, Haoyu Wu, Junru Luo, Xiangzeng Kong, Jun Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13497)  

**Abstract**: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals, neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding 97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework. Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately 58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in resource-constrained settings.

# LiteraryQA: Towards Effective Evaluation of Long-document Narrative QA 

**Authors**: Tommaso Bonomo, Luca Gioffré, Roberto Navigli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13494)  

**Abstract**: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However, the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain, is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works. Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at this https URL.

# Neural Sum-of-Squares: Certifying the Nonnegativity of Polynomials with Transformers 

**Authors**: Nico Pelleriti, Christoph Spiegel, Shiwei Liu, David Martínez-Rubio, Max Zimmer, Sebastian Pokutta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13444)  

**Abstract**: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS) property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial, thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$ compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

# Rectify and Align GPS Points to Parking Spots via Rank-1 Constraint 

**Authors**: Jiaxing Deng, Junbiao Pang, Zhicheng Wang, Haitao Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13439)  

**Abstract**: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management, parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides, the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error. Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper, motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible at:this https URL.

**Authors**: Jingkai Ying, Zhiyuan Qi, Yulong Feng, Zhijin Qin, Zhu Han, Rahim Tafazolli, Yonina C. Eldar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13408)  

**Abstract**: Holographic video communication is considered a paradigm shift in visual communications, becoming increasingly popular for its ability to offer immersive experiences. This article provides an overview of holographic video communication and outlines the requirements of a holographic video communication system. Particularly, following a brief review of semantic com- munication, an architecture for a semantic-enabled holographic video communication system is presented. Key technologies, including semantic sampling, joint semantic-channel coding, and semantic-aware transmission, are designed based on the proposed architecture. Two related use cases are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed methods. Finally, potential research topics are discussed to pave the way for the realization of semantic-enabled holographic video communications.

# From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical Framework 

**Authors**: Kei Itoh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13400)  

**Abstract**: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories, employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of 'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition, which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining existence of artificial intelligence.

# MADREC: A Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent for Explainable and Adaptive Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jiin Park, Misuk Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13371)  

**Abstract**: Recent attempts to integrate large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems have gained momentum, but most remain limited to simple text generation or static prompt-based inference, failing to capture the complexity of user preferences and real-world interactions. This study proposes the Multi-Aspect Driven LLM Agent MADRec, an autonomous LLM-based recommender that constructs user and item profiles by unsupervised extraction of multi-aspect information from reviews and performs direct recommendation, sequential recommendation, and explanation generation. MADRec generates structured profiles via aspect-category-based summarization and applies Re-Ranking to construct high-density inputs. When the ground-truth item is missing from the output, the Self-Feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts the inference criteria. Experiments across multiple domains show that MADRec outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in both precision and explainability, with human evaluation further confirming the persuasiveness of the generated explanations.

# A New Perspective on Transformers in Online Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control 

**Authors**: Nikita Kachaev, Daniil Zelezetsky, Egor Cherepanov, Alexey K. Kovelev, Aleksandr I. Panov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13367)  

**Abstract**: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs, share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks, and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

# Document Intelligence in the Era of Large Language Models: A Survey 

**Authors**: Weishi Wang, Hengchang Hu, Zhijie Zhang, Zhaochen Li, Hongxin Shao, Daniel Dahlmeier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13366)  

**Abstract**: Document AI (DAI) has emerged as a vital application area, and is significantly transformed by the advent of large language models (LLMs). While earlier approaches relied on encoder-decoder architectures, decoder-only LLMs have revolutionized DAI, bringing remarkable advancements in understanding and generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of DAI's evolution, highlighting current research attempts and future prospects of LLMs in this field. We explore key advancements and challenges in multimodal, multilingual, and retrieval-augmented DAI, while also suggesting future research directions, including agent-based approaches and document-specific foundation models. This paper aims to provide a structured analysis of the state-of-the-art in DAI and its implications for both academic and practical applications.

# Language as a Label: Zero-Shot Multimodal Classification of Everyday Postures under Data Scarcity 

**Authors**: MingZe Tang, Jubal Chandy Jacob  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13364)  

**Abstract**: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood. This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2, and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling, counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

# Generalist++: A Meta-learning Framework for Mitigating Trade-off in Adversarial Training 

**Authors**: Yisen Wang, Yichuan Mo, Hongjun Wang, Junyi Li, Zhouchen Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13361)  

**Abstract**: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks, each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the future.

# Adversarial Fine-tuning in Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning for Robust Robot Control 

**Authors**: Shingo Ayabe, Hiroshi Kera, Kazuhiko Kawamoto  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13358)  

**Abstract**: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online adaptability.

# Personal Attribute Leakage in Federated Speech Models 

**Authors**: Hamdan Al-Ali, Ali Reza Ghavamipour, Tommaso Caselli, Fatih Turkmen, Zeerak Talat, Hanan Aldarmaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13357)  

**Abstract**: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender, age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards improved security.

# Protect: Towards Robust Guardrailing Stack for Trustworthy Enterprise LLM Systems 

**Authors**: Karthik Avinash, Nikhil Pareek, Rishav Hada  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13351)  

**Abstract**: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling, and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection. Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard, LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

# AOAD-MAT: Transformer-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model considering agents' order of action decisions 

**Authors**: Shota Takayama, Katsuhide Fujita  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13343)  

**Abstract**: Multi-agent reinforcement learning focuses on training the behaviors of multiple learning agents that coexist in a shared environment. Recently, MARL models, such as the Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) and ACtion dEpendent deep Q-learning (ACE), have significantly improved performance by leveraging sequential decision-making processes. Although these models can enhance performance, they do not explicitly consider the importance of the order in which agents make decisions. In this paper, we propose an Agent Order of Action Decisions-MAT (AOAD-MAT), a novel MAT model that considers the order in which agents make decisions. The proposed model explicitly incorporates the sequence of action decisions into the learning process, allowing the model to learn and predict the optimal order of agent actions. The AOAD-MAT model leverages a Transformer-based actor-critic architecture that dynamically adjusts the sequence of agent actions. To achieve this, we introduce a novel MARL architecture that cooperates with a subtask focused on predicting the next agent to act, integrated into a Proximal Policy Optimization based loss function to synergistically maximize the advantage of the sequential decision-making. The proposed method was validated through extensive experiments on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Multi-Agent MuJoCo benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed AOAD-MAT model outperforms existing MAT and other baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of adjusting the AOAD order in MARL.

# Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning of LLMs 

**Authors**: Nicolas Menet, Aleksandar Terzić, Andreas Krause, Abbas Rahimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13328)  

**Abstract**: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on computational efficiency.

# Injection, Attack and Erasure: Revocable Backdoor Attacks via Machine Unlearning 

**Authors**: Baogang Song, Dongdong Zhao, Jianwen Xiang, Qiben Xu, Zizhuo Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13322)  

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks pose a persistent security risk to deep neural networks (DNNs) due to their stealth and durability. While recent research has explored leveraging model unlearning mechanisms to enhance backdoor concealment, existing attack strategies still leave persistent traces that may be detected through static analysis. In this work, we introduce the first paradigm of revocable backdoor attacks, where the backdoor can be proactively and thoroughly removed after the attack objective is achieved. We formulate the trigger optimization in revocable backdoor attacks as a bilevel optimization problem: by simulating both backdoor injection and unlearning processes, the trigger generator is optimized to achieve a high attack success rate (ASR) while ensuring that the backdoor can be easily erased through unlearning. To mitigate the optimization conflict between injection and removal objectives, we employ a deterministic partition of poisoning and unlearning samples to reduce sampling-induced variance, and further apply the Projected Conflicting Gradient (PCGrad) technique to resolve the remaining gradient conflicts. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method maintains ASR comparable to state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, while enabling effective removal of backdoor behavior after unlearning. This work opens a new direction for backdoor attack research and presents new challenges for the security of machine learning systems.

**Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity, utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective generation of LVLMs.

# LLM one-shot style transfer for Authorship Attribution and Verification 

**Authors**: Pablo Miralles-González, Javier Huertas-Tato, Alejandro Martín, David Camacho  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13302)  

**Abstract**: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover, performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between computational cost and accuracy.

**Authors**: Xuxin Cheng, Ke Zeng, Zhiquan Cao, Linyi Dai, Wenxuan Gao, Fei Han, Ai Jian, Feng Hong, Wenxing Hu, Zihe Huang, Dejian Kong, Jia Leng, Zhuoyuan Liao, Pei Liu, Jiaye Lin, Xing Ma, Jingqing Ruan, Jiaxing Song, Xiaoyu Tan, Ruixuan Xiao, Wenhui Yu, Wenyu Zhan, Haoxing Zhang, Chao Zhou, Hao Zhou, Shaodong Zheng, Ruinian Chen, Siyuan Chen, Ziyang Chen, Yiwen Dong, Yaoyou Fan, Yangyi Fang, Yang Gan, Shiguang Guo, Qi He, Chaowen Hu, Binghui Li, Dailin Li, Xiangyu Li, Yan Li, Chengjian Liu, Xiangfeng Liu, Jiahui Lv, Qiao Ma, Jiang Pan, Cong Qin, Chenxing Sun, Wen Sun, Zhonghui Wang, Abudukelimu Wuerkaixi, Xin Yang, Fangyi Yuan, Yawen Zhu, Tianyi Zhai, Jie Zhang, Runlai Zhang, Yao Xu, Yiran Zhao, Yifan Wang, Xunliang Cai, Yangen Hu, Cao Liu, Lu Pan, Xiaoli Wang, Bo Xiao, Wenyuan Yao, Qianlin Zhou, Benchang Zhu

**Abstract**: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1) Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers, hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently, WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user needs and advancing personalized service.

# To Steer or Not to Steer? Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention for Language Models 

**Authors**: Anna Hedström, Salim I. Amoukou, Tom Bewley, Saumitra Mishra, Manuela Veloso  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13290)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed, manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering, MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction, and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective, non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient approach to mechanistic activation steering.

# A Ratio-Based Shapley Value for Collaborative Machine Learning - Extended Version 

**Authors**: Björn Filter, Ralf Möller, Özgür Lütfü Özçep  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13261)  

**Abstract**: Collaborative machine learning enables multiple data owners to jointly train models for improved predictive performance. However, ensuring incentive compatibility and fair contribution-based rewards remains a critical challenge. Prior work by Sim and colleagues (Rachel Hwee Ling Sim et al: Collaborative machine learning with incentive-aware model rewards. In: International conference on machine learning. PMLR. 2020, pp. 8927-8963) addressed this by allocating model rewards, which are non-monetary and freely replicable, based on the Shapley value of each party's data contribution, measured via information gain. In this paper, we introduce a ratio-based Shapley value that replaces the standard additive formulation with a relative contribution measure. While our overall reward framework, including the incentive definitions and model-reward setting, remains aligned with that of Sim and colleagues, the underlying value function is fundamentally different. Our alternative valuation induces a different distribution of model rewards and offers a new lens through which to analyze incentive properties. We formally define the ratio-based value and prove that it satisfies the same set of incentive conditions as the additive formulation, including adapted versions of fairness, individual rationality, and stability. Like the original approach, our method faces the same fundamental trade-offs between these incentives. Our contribution is a mathematically grounded alternative to the additive Shapley framework, potentially better suited to contexts where proportionality among contributors is more meaningful than additive differences.

# Real-Time Crowd Counting for Embedded Systems with Lightweight Architecture 

**Authors**: Zhiyuan Zhao, Yubin Wen, Siyu Yang, Lichen Ning, Yuandong Liu, Junyu Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13250)  

**Abstract**: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security, urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

# MotionBeat: Motion-Aligned Music Representation via Embodied Contrastive Learning and Bar-Equivariant Contact-Aware Encoding 

**Authors**: Xuanchen Wang, Heng Wang, Weidong Cai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13244)  

**Abstract**: Music is both an auditory and an embodied phenomenon, closely linked to human motion and naturally expressed through dance. However, most existing audio representations neglect this embodied dimension, limiting their ability to capture rhythmic and structural cues that drive movement. We propose MotionBeat, a framework for motion-aligned music representation learning. MotionBeat is trained with two newly proposed objectives: the Embodied Contrastive Loss (ECL), an enhanced InfoNCE formulation with tempo-aware and beat-jitter negatives to achieve fine-grained rhythmic discrimination, and the Structural Rhythm Alignment Loss (SRAL), which ensures rhythm consistency by aligning music accents with corresponding motion events. Architecturally, MotionBeat introduces bar-equivariant phase rotations to capture cyclic rhythmic patterns and contact-guided attention to emphasize motion events synchronized with musical accents. Experiments show that MotionBeat outperforms state-of-the-art audio encoders in music-to-dance generation and transfers effectively to beat tracking, music tagging, genre and instrument classification, emotion recognition, and audio-visual retrieval.

# What "Not" to Detect: Negation-Aware VLMs via Structured Reasoning and Token Merging 

**Authors**: Inha Kang, Youngsun Lim, Seonho Lee, Jiho Choi, Junsuk Choe, Hyunjung Shim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13232)  

**Abstract**: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and "girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection applications.

# MimicParts: Part-aware Style Injection for Speech-Driven 3D Motion Generation 

**Authors**: Lianlian Liu, YongKang He, Zhaojie Chu, Xiaofen Xing, Xiangmin Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13208)  

**Abstract**: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements. Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state. Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

# CleverCatch: A Knowledge-Guided Weak Supervision Model for Fraud Detection 

**Authors**: Amirhossein Mozafari, Kourosh Hashemi, Erfan Shafagh, Soroush Motamedi, Azar Taheri Tayebi, Mohammad A. Tayebi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13205)  

**Abstract**: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of 1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency, offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare fraud detection.

# LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA) for Mitigating Bias in AI Systems 

**Authors**: Sai Suhruth Reddy Karri, Yashwanth Sai Nallapuneni, Laxmi Narasimha Reddy Mallireddy, Gopichand G  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13202)  

**Abstract**: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods, such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels. Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification, toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a 7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7 percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task accuracy and label fidelity.

# Paper Copilot: Tracking the Evolution of Peer Review in AI Conferences 

**Authors**: Jing Yang, Qiyao Wei, Jiaxin Pei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13201)  

**Abstract**: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches, inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust, transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

# StressTransfer: Stress-Aware Speech-to-Speech Translation with Emphasis Preservation 

**Authors**: Xi Chen, Yuchen Song, Satoshi Nakamura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13194)  

**Abstract**: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective, data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

# Behavioral Embeddings of Programs: A Quasi-Dynamic Approach for Optimization Prediction 

**Authors**: Haolin Pan, Jinyuan Dong, Hongbin Zhang, Hongyu Lin, Mingjie Xing, Yanjun Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13158)  

**Abstract**: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words. Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

# Program of Thoughts for Financial Reasoning: Leveraging Dynamic In-Context Examples and Generative Retrieval 

**Authors**: Subhendu Khatuya, Shashwat Naidu, Pawan Goyal, Niloy Ganguly  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13157)  

**Abstract**: Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.

# Stable LLM Ensemble: Interaction between Example Representativeness and Diversity 

**Authors**: Junichiro Niimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13143)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared: centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples (baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6% (macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

# On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models 

**Authors**: Anej Svete, Ashish Sabharwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13117)  

**Abstract**: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact, equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems (including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster reasoning.

# Multi-Label Clinical Text Eligibility Classification and Summarization System 

**Authors**: Surya Tejaswi Yerramsetty, Almas Fathimah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13115)  

**Abstract**: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec) and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

# DriveCritic: Towards Context-Aware, Human-Aligned Evaluation for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Jingyu Song, Zhenxin Li, Shiyi Lan, Xinglong Sun, Nadine Chang, Maying Shen, Joshua Chen, Katherine A. Skinner, Jose M. Alvarez  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13108)  

**Abstract**: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

# TRUSTVIS: A Multi-Dimensional Trustworthiness Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Ruoyu Sun, Da Song, Jiayang Song, Yuheng Huang, Lei Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13106)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to revolutionize Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, critical concerns about their trustworthiness persist, particularly in safety and robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce TRUSTVIS, an automated evaluation framework that provides a comprehensive assessment of LLM trustworthiness. A key feature of our framework is its interactive user interface, designed to offer intuitive visualizations of trustworthiness metrics. By integrating well-known perturbation methods like AutoDAN and employing majority voting across various evaluation methods, TRUSTVIS not only provides reliable results but also makes complex evaluation processes accessible to users. Preliminary case studies on models like Vicuna-7b, Llama2-7b, and GPT-3.5 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in identifying safety and robustness vulnerabilities, while the interactive interface allows users to explore results in detail, empowering targeted model improvements.

# ESI: Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification via Semantic-preserving Intervention for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Mingda Li, Xinyu Li, Weinan Zhang, Longxuan Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13103)  

**Abstract**: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

# A Multi-dimensional Semantic Surprise Framework Based on Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds for Fine-Grained Out-of-Distribution Detection 

**Authors**: Ningkang Peng, Yuzhe Mao, Yuhao Zhang, Linjin Qian, Qianfeng Yu, Yanhui Gu, Yi Chen, Li Kong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13093)  

**Abstract**: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a cornerstone for the safe deployment of AI systems in the open world. However, existing methods treat OOD detection as a binary classification problem, a cognitive flattening that fails to distinguish between semantically close (Near-OOD) and distant (Far-OOD) unknown risks. This limitation poses a significant safety bottleneck in applications requiring fine-grained risk stratification. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from a conventional probabilistic view to a principled information-theoretic framework. We formalize the core task as quantifying the Semantic Surprise of a new sample and introduce a novel ternary classification challenge: In-Distribution (ID) vs. Near-OOD vs. Far-OOD. The theoretical foundation of our work is the concept of Low-Entropy Semantic Manifolds, which are explicitly structured to reflect the data's intrinsic semantic hierarchy. To construct these manifolds, we design a Hierarchical Prototypical Network. We then introduce the Semantic Surprise Vector (SSV), a universal probe that decomposes a sample's total surprise into three complementary and interpretable dimensions: conformity, novelty, and ambiguity. To evaluate performance on this new task, we propose the Normalized Semantic Risk (nSR), a cost-sensitive metric. Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only establishes a new state-of-the-art (sota) on the challenging ternary task, but its robust representations also achieve top results on conventional binary benchmarks, reducing the False Positive Rate by over 60% on datasets like LSUN.

**Authors**: J. Gregory Pauloski, Kyle Chard, Ian T. Foster  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13081)  

**Abstract**: As data-driven methods, artificial intelligence (AI), and automated workflows accelerate scientific tasks, we see the rate of discovery increasingly limited by human decision-making tasks such as setting objectives, generating hypotheses, and designing experiments. We postulate that cooperative agents are needed to augment the role of humans and enable autonomous discovery. Realizing such agents will require progress in both AI and infrastructure.

# Transformer-based Scalable Beamforming Optimization via Deep Residual Learning 

**Authors**: Yubo Zhang, Xiao-Yang Liu, Xiaodong Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13077)  

**Abstract**: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm, a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and online learning approaches.

# NeuroRVQ: Multi-Scale EEG Tokenization for Generative Large Brainwave Models 

**Authors**: Konstantinos Barmpas, Na Lee, Alexandros Koliousis, Yannis Panagakis, Dimitrios A. Adamos, Nikolaos Laskaris, Stefanos Zafeiriou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13068)  

**Abstract**: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM) centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i) multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and multimodal biosignal integration.

# True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable 

**Authors**: Thomas W. Mitchel, Hyunwoo Ryu, Vincent Sitzmann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13063)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability: Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes. Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing experiments.

# Towards Human-Centric Intelligent Treatment Planning for Radiation Therapy 

**Authors**: Adnan Jafar, Xun Jia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13062)  

**Abstract**: Current radiation therapy treatment planning is limited by suboptimal plan quality, inefficiency, and high costs. This perspective paper explores the complexity of treatment planning and introduces Human-Centric Intelligent Treatment Planning (HCITP), an AI-driven framework under human oversight, which integrates clinical guidelines, automates plan generation, and enables direct interactions with operators. We expect that HCITP will enhance efficiency, potentially reducing planning time to minutes, and will deliver personalized, high-quality plans. Challenges and potential solutions are discussed.

# VLA-0: Building State-of-the-Art VLAs with Zero Modification 

**Authors**: Ankit Goyal, Hugo Hadfield, Xuning Yang, Valts Blukis, Fabio Ramos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13054)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0 outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data, including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct. These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design. Visual results, code, and trained models are provided here: this https URL.

# Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting 

**Authors**: Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicolò Michelusi, Erik G. Larsson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13052)  

**Abstract**: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step, an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights, which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

# SceneAdapt: Scene-aware Adaptation of Human Motion Diffusion 

**Authors**: Jungbin Cho, Minsu Kim, Jisoo Kim, Ce Zheng, Laszlo A. Jeni, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Youngjae Yu, Seonjoo Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13044)  

**Abstract**: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold. In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

# SeqBench: Benchmarking Sequential Narrative Generation in Text-to-Video Models 

**Authors**: Zhengxu Tang, Zizheng Wang, Luning Wang, Zitao Shuai, Chenhao Zhang, Siyu Qian, Yirui Wu, Bohao Wang, Haosong Rao, Zhenyu Yang, Chenwei Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13042)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with 2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

# Randomness and Interpolation Improve Gradient Descent 

**Authors**: Jiawen Li, Pascal Lefevre, Anwar Pp Abdul Majeed  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13040)  

**Abstract**: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process. Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks) with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD, implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

# Deliberate Lab: A Platform for Real-Time Human-AI Social Experiments 

**Authors**: Crystal Qian, Vivian Tsai, Michael Behr, Nada Hussein, Léo Laugier, Nithum Thain, Lucas Dixon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13011)  

**Abstract**: Social and behavioral scientists increasingly aim to study how humans interact, collaborate, and make decisions alongside artificial intelligence. However, the experimental infrastructure for such work remains underdeveloped: (1) few platforms support real-time, multi-party studies at scale; (2) most deployments require bespoke engineering, limiting replicability and accessibility, and (3) existing tools do not treat AI agents as first-class participants. We present Deliberate Lab, an open-source platform for large-scale, real-time behavioral experiments that supports both human participants and large language model (LLM)-based agents. We report on a 12-month public deployment of the platform (N=88 experimenters, N=9195 experiment participants), analyzing usage patterns and workflows. Case studies and usage scenarios are aggregated from platform users, complemented by in-depth interviews with select experimenters. By lowering technical barriers and standardizing support for hybrid human-AI experimentation, Deliberate Lab expands the methodological repertoire for studying collective decision-making and human-centered AI.

# Developing and Validating the Arabic Version of the Attitudes Toward Large Language Models Scale 

**Authors**: Basad Barajeeh, Ala Yankouskaya, Sameha AlShakhsi, Chun Sing Maxwell Ho, Guandong Xu, Raian Ali  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13009)  

**Abstract**: As the use of large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly global, understanding public attitudes toward these systems requires tools that are adapted to local contexts and languages. In the Arab world, LLM adoption has grown rapidly with both globally dominant platforms and regional ones like Fanar and Jais offering Arabic-specific solutions. This highlights the need for culturally and linguistically relevant scales to accurately measure attitudes toward LLMs in the region. Tools assessing attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a base for measuring attitudes specific to LLMs. The 5-item Attitudes Toward Artificial Intelligence (ATAI) scale, which measures two dimensions, the AI Fear and the AI Acceptance, has been recently adopted and adapted to develop new instruments in English using a sample from the UK: the Attitudes Toward General LLMs (AT-GLLM) and Attitudes Toward Primary LLM (AT-PLLM) scales. In this paper, we translate the two scales, AT-GLLM and AT-PLLM, and validate them using a sample of 249 Arabic-speaking adults. The results show that the scale, translated into Arabic, is a reliable and valid tool that can be used for the Arab population and language. Psychometric analyses confirmed a two-factor structure, strong measurement invariance across genders, and good internal reliability. The scales also demonstrated strong convergent and discriminant validity. Our scales will support research in a non-Western context, a much-needed effort to help draw a global picture of LLM perceptions, and will also facilitate localized research and policy-making in the Arab region.

# CurLL: A Developmental Framework to Evaluate Continual Learning in Language Models 

**Authors**: Pavan Kalyan, Shubhra Mishra, Satya Lokam, Navin Goyal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13008)  

**Abstract**: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL) grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages 5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity, comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA), and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer, and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances continual learning evaluations for language models.

# Max It or Miss It: Benchmarking LLM On Solving Extremal Problems 

**Authors**: Binxin Gao, Jingjun Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12997)  

**Abstract**: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

# A Multimodal XAI Framework for Trustworthy CNNs and Bias Detection in Deep Representation Learning 

**Authors**: Noor Islam S. Mohammad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12957)  

**Abstract**: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal Explainable AI (XAI) framework that unifies attention-augmented feature fusion, Grad-CAM++-based local explanations, and a Reveal-to-Revise feedback loop for bias detection and mitigation. Evaluated on multimodal extensions of MNIST, our approach achieves 93.2% classification accuracy, 91.6% F1-score, and 78.1% explanation fidelity (IoU-XAI), outperforming unimodal and non-explainable baselines. Ablation studies demonstrate that integrating interpretability with bias-aware learning enhances robustness and human alignment. Our work bridges the gap between performance, transparency, and fairness, highlighting a practical pathway for trustworthy AI in sensitive domains.

# Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation 

**Authors**: Xiao He, Huangxuan Zhao, Guojia Wan, Wei Zhou, Yanxing Liu, Juhua Liu, Yongchao Xu, Yong Luo, Dacheng Tao, Bo Du  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12953)  

**Abstract**: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

# SpareCodeSearch: Searching for Code Context When You Have No Spare GPU 

**Authors**: Minh Nguyen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12948)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks aim to enhance Code Language Models (CLMs) by including another module for retrieving relevant context to construct the input prompt. However, these retrieval modules commonly use semantic search, requiring substantial computational resources for training and hosting these embedded models, making them infeasible to integrate into lightweight applications such as in-IDE AI-based code completion. In this solution paper, we prove that using keyword-search is sufficient to retrieve relevant and useful code context inside large codebases, without the need for extensive GPU resources. The usefulness of code contexts found by our solution is demonstrated through their completion results on the Code Context Competition's benchmark, reaching 0.748 and 0.725 chRF scores on Kotlin and Python tracks, respectively.

# HyWA: Hypernetwork Weight Adapting Personalized Voice Activity Detection 

**Authors**: Mahsa Ghazvini Nejad, Hamed Jafarzadeh Asl, Amin Edraki, Mohammadreza Sadeghi, Masoud Asgharian, Yuanhao Yu, Vahid Partovi Nia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12947)  

**Abstract**: Personalized Voice Activity Detection (PVAD) systems activate only in response to a specific target speaker by incorporating speaker embeddings from enrollment utterances. Unlike existing methods that require architectural changes, such as FiLM layers, our approach employs a hypernetwork to modify the weights of a few selected layers within a standard voice activity detection (VAD) model. This enables speaker conditioning without changing the VAD architecture, allowing the same VAD model to adapt to different speakers by updating only a small subset of the layers. We propose HyWA-PVAD, a hypernetwork weight adaptation method, and evaluate it against multiple baseline conditioning techniques. Our comparison shows consistent improvements in PVAD performance. HyWA also offers practical advantages for deployment by preserving the core VAD architecture. Our new approach improves the current conditioning techniques in two ways: i) increases the mean average precision, ii) simplifies deployment by reusing the same VAD architecture.

# InferA: A Smart Assistant for Cosmological Ensemble Data 

**Authors**: Justin Z. Tam, Pascal Grosset, Divya Banesh, Nesar Ramachandra, Terece L. Turton, James Ahrens  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12920)  

**Abstract**: Analyzing large-scale scientific datasets presents substantial challenges due to their sheer volume, structural complexity, and the need for specialized domain knowledge. Automation tools, such as PandasAI, typically require full data ingestion and lack context of the full data structure, making them impractical as intelligent data analysis assistants for datasets at the terabyte scale. To overcome these limitations, we propose InferA, a multi-agent system that leverages large language models to enable scalable and efficient scientific data analysis. At the core of the architecture is a supervisor agent that orchestrates a team of specialized agents responsible for distinct phases of the data retrieval and analysis. The system engages interactively with users to elicit their analytical intent and confirm query objectives, ensuring alignment between user goals and system actions. To demonstrate the framework's usability, we evaluate the system using ensemble runs from the HACC cosmology simulation which comprises several terabytes.

# KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems 

**Authors**: Hancheng Ye, Zhengqi Gao, Mingyuan Ma, Qinsi Wang, Yuzhe Fu, Ming-Yu Chung, Yueqian Lin, Zhijian Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Danyang Zhuo, Yiran Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12872)  

**Abstract**: Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

# Three Lenses on the AI Revolution: Risk, Transformation, Continuity 

**Authors**: Masoud Makrehchi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12859)  

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as both a continuation of historical technological revolutions and a potential rupture with them. This paper argues that AI must be viewed simultaneously through three lenses: \textit{risk}, where it resembles nuclear technology in its irreversible and global externalities; \textit{transformation}, where it parallels the Industrial Revolution as a general-purpose technology driving productivity and reorganization of labor; and \textit{continuity}, where it extends the fifty-year arc of computing revolutions from personal computing to the internet to mobile. Drawing on historical analogies, we emphasize that no past transition constituted a strict singularity: disruptive shifts eventually became governable through new norms and institutions.
We examine recurring patterns across revolutions -- democratization at the usage layer, concentration at the production layer, falling costs, and deepening personalization -- and show how these dynamics are intensifying in the AI era. Sectoral analysis illustrates how accounting, law, education, translation, advertising, and software engineering are being reshaped as routine cognition is commoditized and human value shifts to judgment, trust, and ethical responsibility. At the frontier, the challenge of designing moral AI agents highlights the need for robust guardrails, mechanisms for moral generalization, and governance of emergent multi-agent dynamics.
We conclude that AI is neither a singular break nor merely incremental progress. It is both evolutionary and revolutionary: predictable in its median effects yet carrying singularity-class tail risks. Good outcomes are not automatic; they require coupling pro-innovation strategies with safety governance, ensuring equitable access, and embedding AI within a human order of responsibility.

# A Critical Review of the Need for Knowledge-Centric Evaluation of Quranic Recitation 

**Authors**: Mohammed Hilal Al-Kharusi, Khizar Hayat, Khalil Bader Al Ruqeishi, Haroon Rashid Lone  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12858)  

**Abstract**: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures, which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis, offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that can faithfully support learners worldwide.

# Adaptive Generation of Bias-Eliciting Questions for LLMs 

**Authors**: Robin Staab, Jasper Dekoninck, Maximilian Baader, Martin Vechev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12857)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely deployed in user-facing applications, reaching hundreds of millions worldwide. As they become integrated into everyday tasks, growing reliance on their outputs raises significant concerns. In particular, users may unknowingly be exposed to model-inherent biases that systematically disadvantage or stereotype certain groups. However, existing bias benchmarks continue to rely on templated prompts or restrictive multiple-choice questions that are suggestive, simplistic, and fail to capture the complexity of real-world user interactions. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a counterfactual bias evaluation framework that automatically generates realistic, open-ended questions over sensitive attributes such as sex, race, or religion. By iteratively mutating and selecting bias-inducing questions, our approach systematically explores areas where models are most susceptible to biased behavior. Beyond detecting harmful biases, we also capture distinct response dimensions that are increasingly relevant in user interactions, such as asymmetric refusals and explicit acknowledgment of bias. Leveraging our framework, we construct CAB, a human-verified benchmark spanning diverse topics, designed to enable cross-model comparisons. Using CAB, we analyze a range of LLMs across multiple bias dimensions, revealing nuanced insights into how different models manifest bias. For instance, while GPT-5 outperforms other models, it nonetheless exhibits persistent biases in specific scenarios. These findings underscore the need for continual improvements to ensure fair model behavior.

# Efficient Adaptive Transformer: An Empirical Study and Reproducible Framework 

**Authors**: Jan Miller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12856)  

**Abstract**: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2, QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework - complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

# Ethic-BERT: An Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Ethical and Non-Ethical Content Classification 

**Authors**: Mahamodul Hasan Mahadi, Md. Nasif Safwan, Souhardo Rahman, Shahnaj Parvin, Aminun Nahar, Kamruddin Nur  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12850)  

**Abstract**: Developing AI systems capable of nuanced ethical reasoning is critical as they increasingly influence human decisions, yet existing models often rely on superficial correlations rather than principled moral understanding. This paper introduces Ethic-BERT, a BERT-based model for ethical content classification across four domains: Commonsense, Justice, Virtue, and Deontology. Leveraging the ETHICS dataset, our approach integrates robust preprocessing to address vocabulary sparsity and contextual ambiguities, alongside advanced fine-tuning strategies like full model unfreezing, gradient accumulation, and adaptive learning rate scheduling. To evaluate robustness, we employ an adversarially filtered "Hard Test" split, isolating complex ethical dilemmas. Experimental results demonstrate Ethic-BERT's superiority over baseline models, achieving 82.32% average accuracy on the standard test, with notable improvements in Justice and Virtue. In addition, the proposed Ethic-BERT attains 15.28% average accuracy improvement in the HardTest. These findings contribute to performance improvement and reliable decision-making using bias-aware preprocessing and proposed enhanced AI model.

# VLURes: Benchmarking VLM Visual and Linguistic Understanding in Low-Resource Languages 

**Authors**: Jesse Atuhurra, Iqra Ali, Tomoya Iwakura, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Tatsuya Hiraoka  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12845)  

**Abstract**: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts. To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets, curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle multi-modal visual reasoning.

# FaStFACT: Faster, Stronger Long-Form Factuality Evaluations in LLMs 

**Authors**: Yingjia Wan, Haochen Tan, Xiao Zhu, Xinyu Zhou, Zhiwei Li, Qingsong Lv, Changxuan Sun, Jiaqi Zeng, Yi Xu, Jianqiao Lu, Yinhong Liu, Zhijiang Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12839)  

**Abstract**: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment. Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1) inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous pipelines.
Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data is available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Qianben Chen, Jingyi Cao, Jiayu Zhang, Tianrui Qin, Xiaowan Li, King Zhu, Dingfeng Shi, He Zhu, Minghao Liu, Xiaobo Liang, Ge Zhang, Jian Yang, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Wangchunshu Zhou

**Abstract**: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM), a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves 13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by 45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

# Semantic knowledge guides innovation and drives cultural evolution 

**Authors**: Anil Yaman, Shen Tian, Björn Lindström  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12837)  

**Abstract**: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture.

# Repurposing Annotation Guidelines to Instruct LLM Annotators: A Case Study 

**Authors**: Kon Woo Kim, Rezarta Islamaj, Jin-Dong Kim, Florian Boudin, Akiko Aizawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12835)  

**Abstract**: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks. Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and automated annotation.

# Gelina: Unified Speech and Gesture Synthesis via Interleaved Token Prediction 

**Authors**: Téo Guichoux, Théodor Lemerle, Shivam Mehta, Jonas Beskow, Gustave Eje Henter, Laure Soulier, Catherine Pelachaud, Nicolas Obin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12834)  

**Abstract**: Human communication is multimodal, with speech and gestures tightly coupled, yet most computational methods for generating speech and gestures synthesize them sequentially, weakening synchrony and prosody alignment. We introduce Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from speech inputs. Subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate competitive speech quality and improved gesture generation over unimodal baselines.

# Coherent Load Profile Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion for LV Distribution Network Scenario Generation 

**Authors**: Alistair Brash, Junyi Lu, Bruce Stephen, Blair Brown, Robert Atkinson, Craig Michie, Fraser MacIntyre, Christos Tachtatzis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12832)  

**Abstract**: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.

# MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training 

**Authors**: Taicheng Guo, Hai Wang, ChaoChun Liu, Mohsen Golalikhani, Xin Chen, Xiangliang Zhang, Chandan K. Reddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12831)  

**Abstract**: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models, logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review to contribute to community research.

# Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers 

**Authors**: Hieu Le Duc, Leo Liberti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12829)  

**Abstract**: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].

# Automatic Speech Recognition in the Modern Era: Architectures, Training, and Evaluation 

**Authors**: Md. Nayeem, Md Shamse Tabrej, Kabbojit Jit Deb, Shaonti Goswami, Md. Azizul Hakim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12827)  

**Abstract**: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has undergone a profound transformation over the past decade, driven by advances in deep learning. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the modern era of ASR, charting its evolution from traditional hybrid systems, such as Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Models (GMM-HMMs) and Deep Neural Network-HMMs (DNN-HMMs), to the now-dominant end-to-end neural architectures. We systematically review the foundational end-to-end paradigms: Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), attention-based encoder-decoder models, and the Recurrent Neural Network Transducer (RNN-T), which established the groundwork for fully integrated speech-to-text systems. We then detail the subsequent architectural shift towards Transformer and Conformer models, which leverage self-attention to capture long-range dependencies with high computational efficiency. A central theme of this survey is the parallel revolution in training paradigms. We examine the progression from fully supervised learning, augmented by techniques like SpecAugment, to the rise of self-supervised learning (SSL) with foundation models such as wav2vec 2.0, which drastically reduce the reliance on transcribed data. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of largescale, weakly supervised models like Whisper, which achieve unprecedented robustness through massive data diversity. The paper also covers essential ecosystem components, including key datasets and benchmarks (e.g., LibriSpeech, Switchboard, CHiME), standard evaluation metrics (e.g., Word Error Rate), and critical considerations for real-world deployment, such as streaming inference, on-device efficiency, and the ethical imperatives of fairness and robustness. We conclude by outlining open challenges and future research directions.

# Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions 

**Authors**: Thao Pham  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12826)  

**Abstract**: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial. While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance. Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting: all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate), while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

# Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction 

**Authors**: Thomas Gschwind, Shramona Chakraborty, Nitin Gupta, Sameep Mehta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12825)  

**Abstract**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation (CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation, including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

# Evidence Without Injustice: A New Counterfactual Test for Fair Algorithms 

**Authors**: Michele Loi, Marcello Di Bello, Nicolò Cangiotti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12822)  

**Abstract**: The growing philosophical literature on algorithmic fairness has examined statistical criteria such as equalized odds and calibration, causal and counterfactual approaches, and the role of structural and compounding injustices. Yet an important dimension has been overlooked: whether the evidential value of an algorithmic output itself depends on structural injustice. Our paradigmatic pair of examples contrasts a predictive policing algorithm, which relies on historical crime data, with a camera-based system that records ongoing offenses, both designed to guide police deployment. In evaluating the moral acceptability of acting on a piece of evidence, we must ask not only whether the evidence is probative in the actual world, but also whether it would remain probative in nearby worlds without the relevant injustices. The predictive policing algorithm fails this test, but the camera-based system passes it. When evidence fails the test, it is morally problematic to use it punitively, more so than evidence that passes the test.

# Beyond Discrete Categories: Multi-Task Valence-Arousal Modeling for Pet Vocalization Analysis 

**Authors**: Junyao Huang, Rumin Situ  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12819)  

**Abstract**: Traditional pet emotion recognition from vocalizations, based on discrete classification, struggles with ambiguity and capturing intensity variations. We propose a continuous Valence-Arousal (VA) model that represents emotions in a two-dimensional space. Our method uses an automatic VA label generation algorithm, enabling large-scale annotation of 42,553 pet vocalization samples. A multi-task learning framework jointly trains VA regression with auxiliary tasks (emotion, body size, gender) to enhance prediction by improving feature learning. Our Audio Transformer model achieves a validation Valence Pearson correlation of r = 0.9024 and an Arousal r = 0.7155, effectively resolving confusion between discrete categories like "territorial" and "happy." This work introduces the first continuous VA framework for pet vocalization analysis, offering a more expressive representation for human-pet interaction, veterinary diagnostics, and behavioral training. The approach shows strong potential for deployment in consumer products like AI pet emotion translators.

# MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning 

**Authors**: Rajarshi Ghosh, Abhay Gupta, Hudson McBride, Anurag Vaidya, Faisal Mahmood  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12818)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes. We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each (69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care. MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning stability in medical AI.

# From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP 

**Authors**: Shanshan Xu, Santosh T.Y.S.S, Barbara Plank  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12817)  

**Abstract**: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and outline actionable steps towards it.

# Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study 

**Authors**: Soheil Hashtarkhani, Rezaur Rashid, Christopher L Brett, Lokesh Chinthala, Fekede Asefa Kumsa, Janet A Zink, Robert L Davis, David L Schwartz, Arash Shaban-Nejad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12813)  

**Abstract**: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

# Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models for Persian in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning 

**Authors**: Mahdi Cherakhloo, Arash Abbasi, Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz, Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12807)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms, with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing. This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs, providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a benchmark for future model development.

# AutoCode: LLMs as Problem Setters for Competitive Programming 

**Authors**: Shang Zhou, Zihan Zheng, Kaiyuan Liu, Zeyu Shen, Zerui Cheng, Zexing Chen, Hansen He, Jianzhu Yao, Huanzhi Mao, Qiuyang Mang, Tianfu Fu, Beichen Li, Dongruixuan Li, Wenhao Chai, Zhuang Liu, Aleksandra Korolova, Peter Henderson, Natasha Jaques, Pramod Viswanath, Saining Xie, Jingbo Shang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12803)  

**Abstract**: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts; target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than 81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.
