This paper presents a comparative evaluation of two systems: GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, in the task of architectural 3D synthesis. We conduct a case study on two buildings from Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1965): Villa Rotonda and Palazzo Porto. High-level architectural models and drawings of these buildings were prepared, inspired by Palladio's original texts and drawings. Through sequential text and image prompting, we assess the systems' abilities in (1) interpreting 2D and 3D representations of buildings from drawings, (2) encoding the buildings into a CAD software script, and (3) self-improving based on outputs. While both systems successfully generate individual parts, they struggle to accurately assemble these parts into the desired spatial relationships, with Claude 3.5 demonstrating better performance, particularly in self-correcting its output. This study contributes to ongoing research on benchmarking the strengths and weaknesses of off-the-shelf AI systems in performing intelligent human tasks that require discipline-specific knowledge. The findings highlight the potential of language-enabled AI systems to act as collaborative technical assistants in the architectural design process."}

Its architecture uses a convolutional-type neural network that contextually processes a sequence of $B$ consecutive numbers to each input. We take an empirical approach and exploit p-Conv to identify the congruence classes of numbers in a validation set using different values for $m$ and $B$. The results show that the different behaviors of p-Conv (i.e., whether it can perform the task or not) can be modeled mathematically in terms of $m$ and $B$.

To address this issue, we propose the problem of cross-model knowledge editing and introduce MindBridge, a scalable solution inspired by the low coupling between modality processing and LLMs in multi-modal models. MindBridge introduces the novel concept of memory modality, which encodes edited knowledge as an independent modality. It first performs LLM-agnostic pre-training of the memory modality and then integrates it with various LLMs. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and popular knowledge editing datasets demonstrate that MindBridge achieves superior performance even in editing tens of thousands of knowledge entries and can flexibly adapt to different LLMs. Our code is available at this https URL."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning.

LLMs are often described as stochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest that they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when prompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs appear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS converging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between cooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail programmatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI challenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games, just not very well.

Consequently, when facing variants of the original problem, their answers very likely resemble the memorized solutions and fail to generalize. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by designing three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation, paraphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST similarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions, we develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of memorization. As expected, as supervised fine-tuning goes on, the memorization score rises before overfitting, suggesting more severe memorization. We demonstrate that common mitigation approaches, such as prompt translation and using evolved variants as data augmentation in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, either compromise the performance or fail to alleviate the memorization issue. Therefore, memorization remains a significant challenge in LLM code generation, highlighting the need for a more effective solution.'}

In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility. Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts, replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

While previous efforts mainly focus on a single modality, test-time distribution shift in the multi-modal setting is more complex and calls for new solutions. This paper tackles the problem of multi-modal test-time adaptation by proposing a novel method named Attention Bootstrapping with Principal Entropy Minimization (ABPEM). We observe that test-time distribution shift causes misalignment across modalities, leading to a large gap between intra-modality discrepancies (measured by self-attention) and inter-modality discrepancies (measured by cross-attention). We name this the attention gap. This attention gap widens with more severe distribution shifts, hindering effective modality fusion. To mitigate this attention gap and encourage better modality fusion, we propose attention bootstrapping that promotes cross-attention with the guidance of self-attention. Moreover, to reduce the gradient noise in the commonly-used entropy minimization, we adopt principal entropy minimization, a refinement of entropy minimization that reduces gradient noise by focusing on the principal parts of entropy, excluding less reliable gradient information. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed ABPEM in comparison with competing baselines.'}

Our findings and simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of potential future risks."}

How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition, making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The first closely resembles the "associative scan" construction used in recent theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms can be predicted and controlled.'}

However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, an RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization.'}

Large-scale datasets often contain images under a wide range of conditions prompting a need to quantify and understand their underlying quality distribution in order to better characterize DNN performance and robustness. Aligning the sensitivities of image quality metrics and DNNs ensures that estimates of quality can act as proxies for image/dataset difficulty independent of the task models trained/evaluated on the data. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but here we seek a quality measure that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. In order to answer this question, we reframe IQA from a causal perspective and examine conditions under which quality metrics are predictive of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that current IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance in the context of classification. We then use our causal framework to provide an alternative formulation and a new image quality metric that is more strongly correlated with DNN performance and can act as a prior on performance without training new task models. Our approach provides a means to directly estimate the quality distribution of large-scale image datasets towards characterizing the relationship between dataset composition and DNN performance.'}

However, this process is too complex for legal experts to handle manually at scale. Tracking dataset provenance, verifying redistribution rights, and assessing evolving legal risks across multiple stages require a level of precision and efficiency that exceeds human capabilities. Addressing this challenge effectively demands AI agents that can systematically trace dataset redistribution, analyze compliance, and identify legal risks. We develop an automated data compliance system called NEXUS and show that AI can perform these tasks with higher accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness than human experts. Our massive legal analysis of 17,429 unique entities and 8,072 license terms using this approach reveals the discrepancies in legal rights between the original datasets before redistribution and their redistributed subsets, underscoring the necessity of the data lifecycle-aware compliance. For instance, we find that out of 2,852 datasets with commercially viable individual license terms, only 605 (21%) are legally permissible for commercialization. This work sets a new standard for AI data governance, advocating for a framework that systematically examines the entire lifecycle of dataset redistribution to ensure transparent, legal, and responsible dataset management."}

To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on implicit bias in LLMs. We begin by introducing key concepts, theories and methods related to implicit bias in psychology, extending them from humans to LLMs. Drawing on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and other psychological frameworks, we categorize detection methods into three primary approaches: word association, task-oriented text generation and decision-making. We divide our taxonomy of evaluation metrics for implicit bias into two categories: single-value-based metrics and comparison-value-based metrics. We classify datasets into two types: sentences with masked tokens and complete sentences, incorporating datasets from various domains to reflect the broad application of LLMs. Although research on mitigating implicit bias in LLMs is still limited, we summarize existing efforts and offer insights on future challenges.

To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil.

To address this, we propose a vibration-assisted hysteresis compensation approach, where controlled vibrational motion is applied along the tendon's movement direction to mitigate friction and reduce dead zones. Experimental results demonstrate that the exerted vibration consistently reduces hysteresis across all tested frequencies, decreasing RMSE by up to 23.41% (from 2.2345 mm to 1.7113 mm) and improving correlation, leading to more accurate trajectory tracking. When combined with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN)-based compensation model, vibration further enhances performance, achieving an 85.2% reduction in MAE (from 1.334 mm to 0.1969 mm). Without vibration, the TCN-based approach still reduces MAE by 72.3% (from 1.334 mm to 0.370 mm) under the same parameter settings.

Recently, many MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly target LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely unexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA methods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these techniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular distribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar setups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware PillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar level in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a single mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to each pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different classes, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large vehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse objects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This class-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new information, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance but also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street and K-Radar). We believe that this straightforward yet effective approach will spark further investigation into MSDA techniques for radar data."}

To achieve this, we leverage features extracted from a foundational image model to compute a visual descriptor for the points. This approach equips the point cloud with visual features that facilitate the optimization of our self-supervised model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art models trained on large datasets.

Our results indicate that the model effectively captures the statistical and spectral characteristics of real EEG data, although challenges remain in replicating high-frequency oscillations in the frontal region. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Critic's learned representations can be fine-tuned for age group classification, achieving an out-of-sample accuracy, significantly better than a shuffled-label baseline.

For the first challenge, we propose a collaborative annotation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Through collaboration among multiple LLMs, it first refines annotations of trigger words from distant supervision and then carries out argument annotation. Next, a voting phase consolidates the annotation preferences across different LLMs. Finally, we create the EEMT dataset, the largest EE dataset to date, featuring over 200,000 samples, 3,465 event types, and 6,297 role types. For the second challenge, we propose an LLM-based Partitioning EE method called LLM-PEE.

However, vision-language misalignment in MLLMs has emerged as a critical challenge, where the textual responses generated by these models are not factually aligned with the given text-image inputs. Existing efforts to address vision-language misalignment have focused on developing specialized vision-language connectors or leveraging visual instruction tuning from diverse domains. In this paper, we tackle this issue from a fundamental yet unexplored perspective by revisiting the core architecture of MLLMs. Most MLLMs are typically built on decoder-only LLMs consisting of a causal attention mechanism, which limits the ability of earlier modalities (e.g., images) to incorporate information from later modalities (e.g., text). To address this problem, we propose AKI, a novel MLLM that unlocks causal attention into modality-mutual attention (MMA) to enable image tokens to attend to text tokens. This simple yet effective design allows AKI to achieve superior performance in 12 multimodal understanding benchmarks (+7.2% on average) without introducing additional parameters and increasing training time. Our MMA design is intended to be generic, allowing for application across various modalities, and scalable to accommodate diverse multimodal scenarios.

This is achieved by continuously monitoring discrepancies between a world model's predictions and observed system behavior during inference. It allows for triggering appropriate measures, such as an emergency stop, once an error threshold is surpassed. This does not require any task-specific knowledge and is thus universally applicable. Simulated experiments on established robot control tasks show the effectiveness of this method, recognizing changes in local robot geometry and global gravitational magnitude. Real-world experiments using an agile quadcopter further demonstrate the benefits of this approach by detecting unexpected forces acting on the vehicle.

Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational quality by balancing prototypicality and diversity within the sampled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in high quality user profiling.

We propose Iterative Value Function Optimization, a novel framework that addresses these limitations through two key components: Monte Carlo Value Estimation, which reduces estimation variance by exploring diverse trajectories, and Iterative On-Policy Optimization, which progressively improves value estimation through collecting trajectories from value-guided policies. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-turn dialogue, and instruction following demonstrate the effectiveness of value-guided decoding approaches in aligning language models. These approaches not only achieve alignment but also significantly reduce computational costs by leveraging principled value function optimization for efficient and effective control.'}

To improve transformer-based SLR, we introduce Relative Quantization Encoding (RQE), a structured embedding approach anchoring landmarks to physiological reference points and quantize motion trajectories. RQE improves attention allocation by decreasing spatial variability, resulting in 44.3% WER reduction in WLASL100, 21.0% in SignBD-200, and significant gains in BdSLW60 and SignBD-90. However, fixed quantization becomes insufficient on large-scale datasets (e.g., WLASL2000), indicating the need for adaptive encoding strategies. Further, RQE-SF, an extended variant that stabilizes shoulder landmarks, achieves improvements in pose consistency at the cost of small trade-offs in lateral view recognition. The attention graphs prove that RQE improves model interpretability by focusing on the major articulatory features (fingers, wrists) and the more distinctive frames instead of global pose changes.

Recent advances in quantum computing, particularly the integration of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) with classical machine learning architectures, offer new opportunities to develop models that may outperform traditional methods.

In this paper, we propose an end to end hybrid classical quantum convolutional neural network (CQ CNN) for AD detection using clinically formatted 3D MRI data. Our approach involves developing a framework to make 3D MRI data usable for machine learning, designing and training a brain tissue segmentation model (Skull Net), and training a diffusion model to generate synthetic images for the minority class. Our converged models exhibit potential quantum advantages, achieving higher accuracy in fewer epochs than classical models. The proposed beta8 3 qubit model achieves an accuracy of 97.50%, surpassing state of the art (SOTA) models while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

Humans can retrieve episodic memories from days to years ago, using them to contextualize and generalize behaviors across novel but structurally related situations. The brain's ability to control episodic memories based on task demands is often attributed to interactions between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC). We propose a reinforcement learning model that incorporates a PFC-HPC interaction mechanism for goal-directed generalization. In our model, the PFC learns to generate query-key representations to encode and retrieve goal-relevant episodic memories, modulating HPC memories top-down based on current task demands. Moreover, the PFC adapts its encoding and retrieval strategies dynamically when faced with multiple goals presented in a blocked, rather than interleaved, manner. Our results show that: (1) combining working memory with selectively retrieved episodic memory allows transfer of decisions among similar environments or situations, (2) top-down control from PFC over HPC improves learning of arbitrary structural associations between events for generalization to novel environments compared to a bottom-up sensory-driven approach, and (3) the PFC encodes generalizable representations during both encoding and retrieval of goal-relevant memories, whereas the HPC exhibits event-specific representations. Together, these findings highlight the importance of goal-directed prefrontal control over hippocampal episodic memory for decision-making in novel situations and suggest a computational mechanism by which PFC-HPC interactions enable flexible behavior."}

The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition.

In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators.

LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets.

Lens is lightweight and adapts sensor parameters to specific models and scenes in real-time. At its core, Lens utilizes VisiT, a training-free, model-specific quality indicator that evaluates individual unlabeled samples at test time using confidence scores without additional adaptation costs. To validate Lens, we introduce ImageNet-ES Diverse, a new benchmark dataset capturing natural perturbations from varying sensor and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments on both ImageNet-ES and our new ImageNet-ES Diverse show that Lens significantly improves model accuracy across various baseline schemes for sensor control and model modification while maintaining low latency in image captures. Lens effectively compensates for large model size differences and integrates synergistically with model improvement techniques. Our code and dataset are available at this http URL."}

To address this gap, we introduce MedHEval, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates hallucinations and mitigation strategies in Med-LVLMs by categorizing them into three underlying causes: visual misinterpretation, knowledge deficiency, and context misalignment. We construct a diverse set of close- and open-ended medical VQA datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess these hallucination types. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 popular (Med)-LVLMs and evaluate 7 state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation techniques. Results reveal that Med-LVLMs struggle with hallucinations arising from different causes while existing mitigation methods show limited effectiveness, especially for knowledge- and context-based errors. These findings underscore the need for improved alignment training and specialized mitigation strategies to enhance Med-LVLMs' reliability. MedHEval establishes a standardized framework for evaluating and mitigating medical hallucinations, guiding the development of more trustworthy Med-LVLMs."}

Specifically, we consider a networked FL system formed by a central server and distributed clients. First, we formulate the PM-aided personalized FL as a regularization-based federated meta-learning problem, where clients join forces to learn a meta-model with knowledge transferred from a private PM stored at the server. Then, we develop an inexact-ADMM-based algorithm, AugFL, to optimize the problem with no need to expose the PM or incur additional computational costs to local clients.

To do this, we modify the usual empirical risk minimization objective such that we instead minimize a new objective that satisfies an elliptic operator over points within the domain. This allows us to use existing theory on elliptic operators to anticipate the behavior of the error for points outside the training set.

In particular, it doens't require the boundness of loss function, as commonly assumed in the literature. Our theory goes beyond the bias-variance tradeoff, aligned with phenomenon typically encountered in deep learning. It is therefore sharp different with other existing nonasymptotic generalization error bounds for neural networks. More explicitly, we propose an explicit generalization error upper bound for multilayer neural networks with arbitrary Lipschitz activations $\\sigma$ with $\\sigma(0)=0$ and broad enough Lipschitz loss functions, without requiring either the width, depth or other hyperparameters of the neural network approaching infinity, a specific neural network architect (e.g. sparsity, boundness of some norms), a particular activation function, a particular optimization algorithm or boundness of the loss function, and with taking the approximation error into consideration. General Lipschitz activation can also be accommodated into our framework. A feature of our theory is that it also considers approximation errors. Furthermore, we show the near minimax optimality of our theory for multilayer ReLU networks for regression problems. Notably, our upper bound exhibits the famous double descent phenomenon for such networks, which is the most distinguished characteristic compared with other existing results. This work emphasizes a view that many classical results should be improved to embrace the unintuitive characteristics of deep learning to get a better understanding of it."}

We then examine the use of task-specific prompts and prediction heads for learning the prior information associated with the conditional task distribution using a one-layer attention model. Our results on loss landscape show that task-specific prompts facilitate a covariance-mean decoupling where prompt-tuning explains the conditional mean of the distribution whereas the variance is learned/explained through in-context learning. Incorporating task-specific head further aids this process by entirely decoupling estimation of mean and variance components.

This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, \\texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \\texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text."}

The model permits continuous parallel learning without forgetting; and is a powerful tokenizer which performs renormalization group. This allows it to exploit redundancy, such that it generates tokens which are always decomposable into a basis set (e.g an alphabet), and can mix features learned from multiple languages. We find that the structure of this model allows it to learn a natural language morphology WITHOUT data.

Although diffusion models have demonstrated superior performance in robot learning due to their task scalability and multi-modal flexibility, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (1) they often produce non-smooth, jerky motions due to their inability to capture temporally consistent movement dynamics, and (2) their iterative sampling process incurs prohibitive latency for many robotic tasks. Inspired by classic robot motion generation methods such as DMPs and ProMPs, which capture temporally and spatially consistent dynamic of trajectories using low-dimensional vectors -- and by recent advances in diffusion-based image generation that use consistency models with probability flow ODEs to accelerate the denoising process, we propose Fast Robot Motion Diffusion (FRMD). FRMD uniquely integrates Movement Primitives (MPs) with Consistency Models to enable efficient, single-step trajectory generation. By leveraging probabilistic flow ODEs and consistency distillation, our method models trajectory distributions while learning a compact, time-continuous motion representation within an encoder-decoder architecture. This unified approach eliminates the slow, multi-step denoising process of conventional diffusion models, enabling efficient one-step inference and smooth robot motion generation.

We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness by fine-tuning on error-correction augmented data using selective masking mechanism, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 79% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 48.34% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across varying complexity levels and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4 with substantially fewer computational resources.'}

The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem.

We leverage recent advances in embedding trained neural networks into optimization problems to propose SEQUOIA, an RL algorithm that directly optimizes for long-term reward over the feasible action space. Our approach embeds a Q-network into a mixed-integer program to select a combinatorial action in each timestep. Here, we focus on planning over restless bandits, a class of planning problems which capture many real-world examples of sequential decision making. We introduce coRMAB, a broader class of restless bandits with combinatorial actions that cannot be decoupled across the arms of the restless bandit, requiring direct solving over the joint, exponentially large action space. We empirically validate SEQUOIA on four novel restless bandit problems with combinatorial constraints: multiple interventions, path constraints, bipartite matching, and capacity constraints.

However, these advancements also amplify the risks of adversarial attacks, particularly when LLM agents can access sensitive external functionalities. Moreover, because LLM agents engage in extensive reasoning or planning before executing final actions, manipulating them into performing targeted malicious actions or invoking specific tools remains a significant challenge. Consequently, directly embedding adversarial strings in malicious instructions or injecting malicious prompts into tool interactions has become less effective against modern LLM agents. In this work, we present UDora, a unified red teaming framework designed for LLM Agents that dynamically leverages the agent's own reasoning processes to compel it toward malicious behavior. Specifically, UDora first samples the model's reasoning for the given task, then automatically identifies multiple optimal positions within these reasoning traces to insert targeted perturbations. Subsequently, it uses the modified reasoning as the objective to optimize the adversarial strings. By iteratively applying this process, the LLM agent will then be induced to undertake designated malicious actions or to invoke specific malicious tools.

We evaluate the model's performance on a simple addition task, where two addends must be summed. The task can be solved by routing information sequentially through an Input module, an Increment module (multiple times), and finally an Output module. We consider two implementations of this system with increasing complexity. First, using hand-designed modules operating on one-hot digit representations, the controller (a LSTM recurrent network) learns to select the appropriate modules (input, increment, output) in the appropriate sequence. Second, we replace the hand-designed modules with learned representation modules for MNIST images and an increment module trained on the task objectives; here again, the controller learns the appropriate sequential module selection to solve the task.

However, the reduction in computational costs due to PEFT does not necessarily translate to a reduction in training time; although the computational costs of the adapter layers are much smaller than the pretrained layers, it is well known that those two types of layers are processed sequentially on GPUs, resulting in significant latency overhead. LoRA and its variants merge low-rank adapter matrices with pretrained weights during inference to avoid latency overhead, but during training, the pretrained weights remain frozen while the adapter matrices are continuously updated, preventing such merging. To mitigate this issue, we propose Partial Connection Adaptation (PaCA), which fine-tunes randomly selected partial connections within the pretrained weights instead of introducing adapter layers in the model. PaCA not only enhances training speed by eliminating the time overhead due to the sequential processing of the adapter and pretrained layers but also reduces activation memory since only partial activations, rather than full activations, need to be stored for gradient computation. Compared to LoRA, PaCA reduces training time by 22% and total memory usage by 16%, while maintaining comparable accuracy across various fine-tuning scenarios, such as fine-tuning on the MMLU dataset and instruction tuning on the Oasst1 dataset.

In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the accuracy of the sensitivity metric, and find that existing gradient and Hessian based metrics are very inaccurate: they underestimate quantization's impact on the loss function by orders of magnitude, mainly due to the small convergence radius of local 2nd order approximation, \\ie, gradient and Hessian term in Taylor's formula.

They first generate coarse proposals, followed by encoding and fusing regional features. However, indiscriminate sampling and fusion often overlook the varying contributions of individual points and lead to exponentially increased complexity as the number of input frames grows. Moreover, arbitrary result-level concatenation limits the global information extraction. In this paper, we propose a Focal Token Acquring-and-Scaling Transformer (FASTer), which dynamically selects focal tokens and condenses token sequences in an adaptive and lightweight manner. Emphasizing the contribution of individual tokens, we propose a simple but effective Adaptive Scaling mechanism to capture geometric contexts while sifting out focal points. Adaptively storing and processing only focal points in historical frames dramatically reduces the overall complexity. Furthermore, a novel Grouped Hierarchical Fusion strategy is proposed, progressively performing sequence scaling and Intra-Group Fusion operations to facilitate the exchange of global spatial and temporal information. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our FASTer significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in both performance and efficiency while also exhibiting improved flexibility and robustness.

In this paper, we exploit a novel DL-based scheme for efficient OFDM channel estimation where the neural networks for channel reconstruction and generalization are respectively designed. For the former, we propose a dual-attention-aided super-resolution neural network (DA-SRNN) to map the channels at pilot positions to the whole time-frequency channels. Specifically, the channel-spatial attention mechanism is first introduced to sequentially infer attention maps along two separate dimensions corresponding to two types of underlying channel correlations, and then the lightweight SR module is developed for efficient channel reconstruction. For the latter, we introduce continual learning (CL)-aided training strategies to make the neural network adapt to different channel distributions. Specifically, the elastic weight consolidation (EWC) is introduced as the regularization term in regard to loss function of channel reconstruction, which can constrain the direction and space of updating the important weights of neural networks among different channel distributions. Meanwhile, the corresponding training process is provided in detail. By evaluating under 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) channel models, numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed channel estimation scheme with significantly improved channel reconstruction and generalization performance over counterparts.'}

While these reasoning strategies have demonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks, their applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly the challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of reasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular reasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts comprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both unimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More importantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the most effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy optimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning ability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning strategies compared to unimodal TSF. Beyond these insights, ReC4TS establishes two pioneering starting blocks to support future zero-shot TSF reasoning research: (1) A novel dataset, TimeThinking, containing forecasting samples annotated with reasoning trajectories from multiple advanced LLMs, and (2) A new and simple test-time scaling-law validated on foundational TSF models enabled by self-consistency reasoning strategy.

Conversely, Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms to achieve global receptive fields but struggle to inherit the intrinsic graph structural priors of GNNs. This paper proposes a novel knowledge distillation framework that systematically transfers multiscale structural knowledge from GNN teacher models to Transformer student models, offering a new perspective on addressing the critical challenges in cross-architectural distillation. The framework effectively bridges the architectural gap between GNNs and Transformers through micro-macro distillation losses and multiscale feature alignment.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for learning a policy committee that includes at least one near-optimal policy with high probability for tasks encountered during execution. While we show that this problem is in general inapproximable, we present two practical algorithmic solutions. The first yields provable approximation and task sample complexity guarantees when tasks are low-dimensional (the best we can do due to inapproximability), whereas the second is a general and practical gradient-based approach. In addition, we provide a provable sample complexity bound for few-shot learning.

This challenge raises a fundamental question about the impact of imperfect surrogate model on the performance gap between its optima and the true optima, and to what extent the performance loss can be mitigated. Although prior work developed methods to improve the robustness of surrogate models and their associated optimization processes, a provably quantifiable relationship between an imperfect surrogate and the corresponding performance gap, as well as whether prior methods directly address it, remain elusive. To shed light on this important question, we present a theoretical framework to understand offline black-box optimization, by explicitly bounding the optimization quality based on how well the surrogate matches the latent gradient field that underlines the offline data. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we propose a principled black-box gradient matching algorithm to create effective surrogate models for offline optimization, improving over prior approaches on various real-world benchmarks.'}

Specifically, we learn a transformation that maps embeddings from one agent\'s encoder to another agent\'s encoder without further fine-tuning. Our approach relies on a small set of "anchor" observations that are semantically aligned, which we use to estimate an affine or orthogonal transform. Once the transformation is found, an existing controller trained for one domain can interpret embeddings from a different (existing) encoder in a zero-shot fashion, skipping additional trainings. We empirically demonstrate that our framework preserves high performance under visual and task domain shifts. We empirically demonstrate zero-shot stitching performance on the CarRacing environment with changing background and task. By allowing modular re-assembly of existing policies, it paves the way for more robust, compositional RL in dynamically changing environments.'}

PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($>65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix.

In FairGen, a latent guidance module dynamically adjusts the diffusion process to enforce specific attributes, while a memory module tracks the generation statistics and steers latent guidance to align with the targeted fair distribution of the attribute values. Further, given the limitations of existing datasets in comprehensively assessing bias in diffusion models, we introduce a holistic bias evaluation benchmark HBE, covering diverse domains and incorporating complex prompts across various applications. Extensive evaluations on HBE and Stable Bias datasets demonstrate that FairGen outperforms existing bias mitigation approaches, achieving substantial bias reduction (e.g., 68.5% gender bias reduction on Stable Diffusion 2).

To address this issue, we introduce the alignment potential metric, which quantifies the gap from the model's current implicit reward margin to the target explicit reward margin, thereby estimating the model's potential to align with the preference data. Empirical results demonstrate that training on data selected by this metric consistently enhances alignment performance, surpassing existing metrics across different base models and optimization objectives. Furthermore, our method extends to self-play data generation frameworks, where the metric is used to identify high-quality data within the self-generated content by LLMs. Under this data generation scenario, our method surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various training settings and demonstrates continuous improvements in alignment performance as dataset size and training iterations increase."}

This survey provides an extensive review of recent advancements in Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), which integrate visual and textual data to enhance healthcare outcomes. We discuss the foundational technology behind Med-VLMs, illustrating how general models are adapted for complex medical tasks, and examine their applications in healthcare. The transformative impact of Med-VLMs on clinical practice, education, and patient care is highlighted, alongside challenges such as data scarcity, narrow task generalization, interpretability issues, and ethical concerns like fairness, accountability, and privacy. These limitations are exacerbated by uneven dataset distribution, computational demands, and regulatory hurdles. Rigorous evaluation methods and robust regulatory frameworks are essential for safe integration into healthcare workflows. Future directions include leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets, improving cross-modal generalization, and enhancing interpretability. Innovations like federated learning, lightweight architectures, and Electronic Health Record (EHR) integration are explored as pathways to democratize access and improve clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Med-VLMs' strengths and limitations, fostering their ethical and balanced adoption in healthcare."}

The techniques applied to SPM applications are mostly statistically oriented. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated the imagination of adopting AI for SPM applications. This manuscript begins with a concise review of the historical development of the statistically based SPM methods. Next, this manuscript explores AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods applied in various SPM applications, addressing quality characteristics of univariate, multivariate, profile, and image. These AI methods can be classified into the following categories: classification, pattern recognition, time series applications, and generative AI. Specifically, different kinds of neural networks, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN), are among the most implemented AI methods impacting SPM. Finally, this manuscript outlines a couple of future directions that harness the potential of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for advancing SPM research and applications in complex systems. The ultimate objective is to transform statistical process monitoring (SPM) into smart process control (SMPC), where corrective actions are autonomously implemented to either prevent quality issues or restore process performance.'}

LLM unlearning offers a principled approach to removing the influence of undesirable data (e.g., sensitive or illegal information) from LLMs, while preserving their overall utility without requiring full retraining. Despite growing research interest, there is no comprehensive survey that systematically organizes existing work and distills key insights; here, we aim to bridge this gap. We begin by introducing the definition and the paradigms of LLM unlearning, followed by a comprehensive taxonomy of existing unlearning studies. Next, we categorize current unlearning approaches, summarizing their strengths and limitations. Additionally, we review evaluation metrics and benchmarks, providing a structured overview of current assessment methodologies. Finally, we outline promising directions for future research, highlighting key challenges and opportunities in the field.'}

Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images. Following this, we introduce \\textbf{Re}flectance-aware \\textbf{D}iffusion with \\textbf{Di}stilled \\textbf{T}rajectory (\\textbf{ReDDiT}), an efficient and flexible distillation framework tailored for LLIE. Our framework achieves comparable performance to previous diffusion-based methods with redundant steps in just 2 steps while establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 8 or 4 steps. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing SOTA methods.'}
