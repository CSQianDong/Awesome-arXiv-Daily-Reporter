**Abstract**: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of agentic AI systems that extend beyond the capabilities of standalone models. By empowering LLMs to perceive external environments, integrate multimodal information, and interact with various tools, these agentic systems exhibit greater autonomy and adaptability across complex tasks. This evolution brings new opportunities to recommender systems (RS): LLM-based Agentic RS (LLM-ARS) can offer more interactive, context-aware, and proactive recommendations, potentially reshaping the user experience and broadening the application scope of RS. Despite promising early results, fundamental challenges remain, including how to effectively incorporate external knowledge, balance autonomy with controllability, and evaluate performance in dynamic, multimodal settings. In this perspective paper, we first present a systematic analysis of LLM-ARS: (1) clarifying core concepts and architectures; (2) highlighting how agentic capabilities -- such as planning, memory, and multimodal reasoning -- can enhance recommendation quality; and (3) outlining key research questions in areas such as safety, efficiency, and lifelong personalization. We also discuss open problems and future directions, arguing that LLM-ARS will drive the next wave of RS innovation. Ultimately, we foresee a paradigm shift toward intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative recommendation experiences that more closely align with users' evolving needs and complex decision-making processes.

# Improving Interactive Diagnostic Ability of a Large Language Model Agent Through Clinical Experience Learning 

**Authors**: Zhoujian Sun, Ziyi Liu, Cheng Luo, Jiebin Chu, Zhengxing Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16463)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results in medical diagnosis, with some studies indicating superior performance compared to human physicians in specific scenarios. However, the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs are often overestimated, as their performance significantly deteriorates in interactive diagnostic settings that require active information gathering. This study investigates the underlying mechanisms behind the performance degradation phenomenon and proposes a solution. We identified that the primary deficiency of LLMs lies in the initial diagnosis phase, particularly in information-gathering efficiency and initial diagnosis formation, rather than in the subsequent differential diagnosis phase. To address this limitation, we developed a plug-and-play method enhanced (PPME) LLM agent, leveraging over 3.5 million electronic medical records from Chinese and American healthcare facilities. Our approach integrates specialized models for initial disease diagnosis and inquiry into the history of the present illness, trained through supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. The experimental results indicate that the PPME LLM achieved over 30% improvement compared to baselines. The final diagnostic accuracy of the PPME LLM in interactive diagnostic scenarios approached levels comparable to those achieved using complete clinical data. These findings suggest a promising potential for developing autonomous diagnostic systems, although further validation studies are needed.

# Multimodal Transformer Models for Turn-taking Prediction: Effects on Conversational Dynamics of Human-Agent Interaction during Cooperative Gameplay 

**Authors**: Young-Ho Bae, Casey C. Bennett  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16432)  

**Abstract**: This study investigates multimodal turn-taking prediction within human-agent interactions (HAI), particularly focusing on cooperative gaming environments. It comprises both model development and subsequent user study, aiming to refine our understanding and improve conversational dynamics in spoken dialogue systems (SDSs). For the modeling phase, we introduce a novel transformer-based deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously integrates multiple modalities - text, vision, audio, and contextual in-game data to predict turn-taking events in real-time. Our model employs a Crossmodal Transformer architecture to effectively fuse information from these diverse modalities, enabling more comprehensive turn-taking predictions. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving 87.3% accuracy and 83.0% macro F1 score. A human user study was then conducted to empirically evaluate the turn-taking DL model in an interactive scenario with a virtual avatar while playing the game "Dont Starve Together", comparing a control condition without turn-taking prediction (n=20) to an experimental condition with our model deployed (n=40). Both conditions included a mix of English and Korean speakers, since turn-taking cues are known to vary by culture. We then analyzed the interaction quality, examining aspects such as utterance counts, interruption frequency, and participant perceptions of the avatar. Results from the user study suggest that our multimodal turn-taking model not only enhances the fluidity and naturalness of human-agent conversations, but also maintains a balanced conversational dynamic without significantly altering dialogue frequency. The study provides in-depth insights into the influence of turn-taking abilities on user perceptions and interaction quality, underscoring the potential for more contextually adaptive and responsive conversational agents.

# EmpathyAgent: Can Embodied Agents Conduct Empathetic Actions? 

**Authors**: Xinyan Chen, Jiaxin Ge, Hongming Dai, Qiang Zhou, Qiuxuan Feng, Jingtong Hu, Yizhou Wang, Jiaming Liu, Shanghang Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16545)  

**Abstract**: Empathy is fundamental to human interactions, yet it remains unclear whether embodied agents can provide human-like empathetic support. Existing works have studied agents' tasks solving and social interactions abilities, but whether agents can understand empathetic needs and conduct empathetic behaviors remains overlooked. To address this, we introduce EmpathyAgent, the first benchmark to evaluate and enhance agents' empathetic actions across diverse scenarios. EmpathyAgent contains 10,000 multimodal samples with corresponding empathetic task plans and three different challenges. To systematically evaluate the agents' empathetic actions, we propose an empathy-specific evaluation suite that evaluates the agents' empathy process. We benchmark current models and found that exhibiting empathetic actions remains a significant challenge. Meanwhile, we train Llama3-8B using EmpathyAgent and find it can potentially enhance empathetic behavior. By establishing a standard benchmark for evaluating empathetic actions, we hope to advance research in empathetic embodied agents. Our code and data are publicly available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Andrew Cho, Jason M. Woo, Brian Shi, Aishwaryaa Udeshi, Jonathan S. H. Woo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16433)  

**Abstract**: Under-resourced or rural hospitals have limited access to medical specialists and healthcare professionals, which can negatively impact patient outcomes in sepsis. To address this gap, we developed the MATEC (Multi-AI Agent Team Care) framework, which integrates a team of specialized AI agents for sepsis care. The sepsis AI agent team includes five doctor agents, four health professional agents, and a risk prediction model agent, with an additional 33 doctor agents available for consultations. Ten attending physicians at a teaching hospital evaluated this framework, spending approximately 40 minutes on the web-based MATEC application and participating in the 5-point Likert scale survey (rated from 1-unfavorable to 5-favorable). The physicians found the MATEC framework very useful (Median=4, P=0.01), and very accurate (Median=4, P<0.01). This pilot study demonstrates that a Multi-AI Agent Team Care framework (MATEC) can potentially be useful in assisting medical professionals, particularly in under-resourced hospital settings.

# MAPS: A Multi-Agent Framework Based on Big Seven Personality and Socratic Guidance for Multimodal Scientific Problem Solving 

**Authors**: Jian Zhang, Zhiyuan Wang, Zhangqi Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Fangzhi Xu, Qika Lin, Rui Mao, Erik Cambria, Jun Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16905)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal scientific problems (MSPs) involve complex issues that require the integration of multiple modalities, such as text and diagrams, presenting a significant challenge in artificial intelligence. While progress has been made in addressing traditional scientific problems, MSPs still face two primary issues: the challenge of multi-modal comprehensive reasoning in scientific problem-solving and the lack of reflective and rethinking capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce a Multi-Agent framework based on the Big Seven Personality and Socratic guidance (MAPS). This framework employs seven distinct agents that leverage feedback mechanisms and the Socratic method to guide the resolution of MSPs. To tackle the first issue, we propose a progressive four-agent solving strategy, where each agent focuses on a specific stage of the problem-solving process. For the second issue, we introduce a Critic agent, inspired by Socratic questioning, which prompts critical thinking and stimulates autonomous learning. We conduct extensive experiments on the EMMA, Olympiad, and MathVista datasets, achieving promising results that outperform the current SOTA model by 15.84% across all tasks. Meanwhile, the additional analytical experiments also verify the model's progress as well as generalization ability.

# MARS: A Multi-Agent Framework Incorporating Socratic Guidance for Automated Prompt Optimization 

**Authors**: Jian Zhang, Zhangqi Wang, Haiping Zhu, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Erik Cambria  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16874)  

**Abstract**: The basic question-answering format of large language models involves inputting a prompt and receiving a response, and the quality of the prompt directly impacts the effectiveness of the response. Automated Prompt Optimization (APO) aims to break free from the cognitive biases of manually designed prompts and explores a broader design space for prompts. However, existing APO methods suffer from limited flexibility of fixed templates and inefficient search in prompt spaces as key issues. To this end, we propose a Multi-Agent framework Incorporating Socratic guidance (MARS), which utilizes multi-agent fusion technology for automatic planning, with gradual continuous optimization and evaluation. Specifically, MARS comprises seven agents, each with distinct functionalities, which autonomously use the Planner to devise an optimization path that ensures flexibility. Additionally, it employs a Teacher-Critic-Student Socratic dialogue pattern to iteratively optimize the prompts while conducting effective search. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method, and perform additional analytical experiments to assess the model's advancement as well as the interpretability.

# Empowering Medical Multi-Agents with Clinical Consultation Flow for Dynamic Diagnosis 

**Authors**: Sihan Wang, Suiyang Jiang, Yibo Gao, Boming Wang, Shangqi Gao, Xiahai Zhuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16547)  

**Abstract**: Traditional AI-based healthcare systems often rely on single-modal data, limiting diagnostic accuracy due to incomplete information. However, recent advancements in foundation models show promising potential for enhancing diagnosis combining multi-modal information. While these models excel in static tasks, they struggle with dynamic diagnosis, failing to manage multi-turn interactions and often making premature diagnostic decisions due to insufficient persistence in information this http URL address this, we propose a multi-agent framework inspired by consultation flow and reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate the entire consultation process, integrating multiple clinical information for effective diagnosis. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical action set, structured from clinic consultation flow and medical textbook, to effectively guide the decision-making process. This strategy improves agent interactions, enabling them to adapt and optimize actions based on the dynamic state. We evaluated our framework on a public dynamic diagnosis benchmark. The proposed framework evidentially improves the baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing foundation model-based methods.

# Does Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Help Mobile GUI Agent? An Empirical Study 

**Authors**: Li Zhang, Longxi Gao, Mengwei Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16788)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning capabilities have significantly improved the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) in domains such as mathematical problem-solving, coding, and visual question-answering. However, their impact on real-world applications remains unclear. This paper presents the first empirical study on the effectiveness of reasoning-enabled VLMs in mobile GUI agents, a domain that requires interpreting complex screen layouts, understanding user instructions, and executing multi-turn interactions. We evaluate two pairs of commercial models--Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.7 Sonnet--comparing their base and reasoning-enhanced versions across two static benchmarks (ScreenSpot and AndroidControl) and one interactive environment (AndroidWorld). We surprisingly find the Claude 3.7 Sonnet reasoning model achieves state-of-the-art performance on AndroidWorld. However, reasoning VLMs generally offer marginal improvements over non-reasoning models on static benchmarks and even degrade performance in some agent setups. Notably, reasoning and non-reasoning VLMs fail on different sets of tasks, suggesting that reasoning does have an impact, but its benefits and drawbacks counterbalance each other. We attribute these inconsistencies to the limitations of benchmarks and VLMs. Based on the findings, we provide insights for further enhancing mobile GUI agents in terms of benchmarks, VLMs, and their adaptability in dynamically invoking reasoning VLMs. The experimental data are publicly available at this https URL.

# Towards Automated Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning via Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Zhaoxin Li, Zhang Xi-Jia, Batuhan Altundas, Letian Chen, Rohan Paleja, Matthew Gombolay  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16724)  

**Abstract**: Semantic Interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency, accountability, and safer deployment by making the agent's decisions understandable and verifiable. Achieving this, however, requires a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts, which traditionally rely on human specification and fail to generalize to unseen environments. In this work, we introduce Semantically Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with Vision-Language Models Empowered Automation (SILVA), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and interpretable tree-based models for policy optimization. SILVA first queries a VLM to identify relevant semantic features for an unseen environment, then extracts these features from the environment. Finally, it trains an Interpretable Control Tree via RL, mapping the extracted features to actions in a transparent and interpretable manner. To address the computational inefficiency of extracting features directly with VLMs, we develop a feature extraction pipeline that generates a dataset for training a lightweight convolutional network, which is subsequently used during RL. By leveraging VLMs to automate tree-based RL, SILVA removes the reliance on human annotation previously required by interpretable models while also overcoming the inability of VLMs alone to generate valid robot policies, enabling semantically interpretable reinforcement learning without human-in-the-loop.

# CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities 

**Authors**: Yuxuan Zhu, Antony Kellermann, Dylan Bowman, Philip Li, Akul Gupta, Adarsh Danda, Richard Fang, Conner Jensen, Eric Ihli, Jason Benn, Jet Geronimo, Avi Dhir, Sudhit Rao, Kaicheng Yu, Twm Stone, Daniel Kang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17332)  

**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications. This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities. However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to 13% of vulnerabilities.

# LLM+MAP: Bimanual Robot Task Planning using Large Language Models and Planning Domain Definition Language 

**Authors**: Kun Chu, Xufeng Zhao, Cornelius Weber, Stefan Wermter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17309)  

**Abstract**: Bimanual robotic manipulation provides significant versatility, but also presents an inherent challenge due to the complexity involved in the spatial and temporal coordination between two hands. Existing works predominantly focus on attaining human-level manipulation skills for robotic hands, yet little attention has been paid to task planning on long-horizon timescales. With their outstanding in-context learning and zero-shot generation abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied and grounded in diverse robotic embodiments to facilitate task planning. However, LLMs still suffer from errors in long-horizon reasoning and from hallucinations in complex robotic tasks, lacking a guarantee of logical correctness when generating the plan. Previous works, such as LLM+P, extended LLMs with symbolic planners. However, none have been successfully applied to bimanual robots. New challenges inevitably arise in bimanual manipulation, necessitating not only effective task decomposition but also efficient task allocation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LLM+MAP, a bimanual planning framework that integrates LLM reasoning and multi-agent planning, automating effective and efficient bimanual task planning. We conduct simulated experiments on various long-horizon manipulation tasks of differing complexity. Our method is built using GPT-4o as the backend, and we compare its performance against plans generated directly by LLMs, including GPT-4o, V3 and also recent strong reasoning models o1 and R1. By analyzing metrics such as planning time, success rate, group debits, and planning-step reduction rate, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLM+MAP, while also providing insights into robotic reasoning.

# Deterministic AI Agent Personality Expression through Standard Psychological Diagnostics 

**Authors**: J. M. Diederik Kruijssen, Nicholas Emmons  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17085)  

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems powered by large language models have become increasingly prevalent in modern society, enabling a wide range of applications through natural language interaction. As AI agents proliferate in our daily lives, their generic and uniform expressiveness presents a significant limitation to their appeal and adoption. Personality expression represents a key prerequisite for creating more human-like and distinctive AI systems. We show that AI models can express deterministic and consistent personalities when instructed using established psychological frameworks, with varying degrees of accuracy depending on model capabilities. We find that more advanced models like GPT-4o and o1 demonstrate the highest accuracy in expressing specified personalities across both Big Five and Myers-Briggs assessments, and further analysis suggests that personality expression emerges from a combination of intelligence and reasoning capabilities. Our results reveal that personality expression operates through holistic reasoning rather than question-by-question optimization, with response-scale metrics showing higher variance than test-scale metrics. Furthermore, we find that model fine-tuning affects communication style independently of personality expression accuracy. These findings establish a foundation for creating AI agents with diverse and consistent personalities, which could significantly enhance human-AI interaction across applications from education to healthcare, while additionally enabling a broader range of more unique AI agents. The ability to quantitatively assess and implement personality expression in AI systems opens new avenues for research into more relatable, trustworthy, and ethically designed AI.

# Symbolic Audio Classification via Modal Decision Tree Learning 

**Authors**: Enrico Marzano, Giovanni Pagliarini, Riccardo Pasini, Guido Sciavicco, Ionel Eduard Stan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17018)  

**Abstract**: The range of potential applications of acoustic analysis is wide. Classification of sounds, in particular, is a typical machine learning task that received a lot of attention in recent years. The most common approaches to sound classification are sub-symbolic, typically based on neural networks, and result in black-box models with high performances but very low transparency. In this work, we consider several audio tasks, namely, age and gender recognition, emotion classification, and respiratory disease diagnosis, and we approach them with a symbolic technique, that is, (modal) decision tree learning. We prove that such tasks can be solved using the same symbolic pipeline, that allows to extract simple rules with very high accuracy and low complexity. In principle, all such tasks could be associated to an autonomous conversation system, which could be useful in different contexts, such as an automatic reservation agent for an hospital or a clinic.

# Leveraging Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery in Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Chan Kim, Seung-Woo Seo, Seong-Woo Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17125)  

**Abstract**: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated strong performance in robotic control but remains susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) states, often resulting in unreliable actions and task failure. While previous methods have focused on minimizing or preventing OOD occurrences, they largely neglect recovery once an agent encounters such states. Although the latest research has attempted to address this by guiding agents back to in-distribution states, their reliance on uncertainty estimation hinders scalability in complex environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Language Models for Out-of-Distribution Recovery (LaMOuR), which enables recovery learning without relying on uncertainty estimation. LaMOuR generates dense reward codes that guide the agent back to a state where it can successfully perform its original task, leveraging the capabilities of LVLMs in image description, logical reasoning, and code generation. Experimental results show that LaMOuR substantially enhances recovery efficiency across diverse locomotion tasks and even generalizes effectively to complex environments, including humanoid locomotion and mobile manipulation, where existing methods struggle. The code and supplementary materials are available at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

# Fewer Than 1% of Explainable AI Papers Validate Explainability with Humans 

**Authors**: Ashley Suh, Isabelle Hurley, Nora Smith, Ho Chit Siu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16507)  

**Abstract**: This late-breaking work presents a large-scale analysis of explainable AI (XAI) literature to evaluate claims of human explainability. We collaborated with a professional librarian to identify 18,254 papers containing keywords related to explainability and interpretability. Of these, we find that only 253 papers included terms suggesting human involvement in evaluating an XAI technique, and just 128 of those conducted some form of a human study. In other words, fewer than 1% of XAI papers (0.7%) provide empirical evidence of human explainability when compared to the broader body of XAI literature. Our findings underscore a critical gap between claims of human explainability and evidence-based validation, raising concerns about the rigor of XAI research. We call for increased emphasis on human evaluations in XAI studies and provide our literature search methodology to enable both reproducibility and further investigation into this widespread issue.

# LeRAAT: LLM-Enabled Real-Time Aviation Advisory Tool 

**Authors**: Marc R. Schlichting, Vale Rasmussen, Heba Alazzeh, Houjun Liu, Kiana Jafari, Amelia F. Hardy, Dylan M. Asmar, Mykel J. Kochenderfer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16477)  

**Abstract**: In aviation emergencies, high-stakes decisions must be made in an instant. Pilots rely on quick access to precise, context-specific information -- an area where emerging tools like large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing critical support. This paper introduces LeRAAT, a framework that integrates LLMs with the X-Plane flight simulator to deliver real-time, context-aware pilot assistance. The system uses live flight data, weather conditions, and aircraft documentation to generate recommendations aligned with aviation best practices and tailored to the particular situation. It employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that extracts and synthesizes information from aircraft type-specific manuals, including performance specifications and emergency procedures, as well as aviation regulatory materials, such as FAA directives and standard operating procedures. We showcase the framework in both a virtual reality and traditional on-screen simulation, supporting a wide range of research applications such as pilot training, human factors research, and operational decision support.

# VeriMind: Agentic LLM for Automated Verilog Generation with a Novel Evaluation Metric 

**Authors**: Bardia Nadimi, Ghali Omar Boutaib, Hao Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16514)  

**Abstract**: Designing Verilog modules requires meticulous attention to correctness, efficiency, and adherence to design specifications. However, manually writing Verilog code remains a complex and time-consuming task that demands both expert knowledge and iterative refinement. Leveraging recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their structured text generation capabilities, we propose VeriMind, an agentic LLM framework for Verilog code generation that significantly automates and optimizes the synthesis process. Unlike traditional LLM-based code generators, VeriMind employs a structured reasoning approach: given a user-provided prompt describing design requirements, the system first formulates a detailed train of thought before the final Verilog code is generated. This multi-step methodology enhances interpretability, accuracy, and adaptability in hardware design. In addition, we introduce a novel evaluation metric-pass@ARC-which combines the conventional pass@k measure with Average Refinement Cycles (ARC) to capture both success rate and the efficiency of iterative refinement. Experimental results on diverse hardware design tasks demonstrated that our approach achieved up to $8.3\%$ improvement on pass@k metric and $8.1\%$ on pass@ARC metric. These findings underscore the transformative potential of agentic LLMs in automated hardware design, RTL development, and digital system synthesis.

# Enhancing Explainability with Multimodal Context Representations for Smarter Robots 

**Authors**: Anargh Viswanath, Lokesh Veeramacheneni, Hendrik Buschmeier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16467)  

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced in recent years, driving innovation across various fields, especially in robotics. Even though robots can perform complex tasks with increasing autonomy, challenges remain in ensuring explainability and user-centered design for effective interaction. A key issue in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is enabling robots to effectively perceive and reason over multimodal inputs, such as audio and vision, to foster trust and seamless collaboration. In this paper, we propose a generalized and explainable multimodal framework for context representation, designed to improve the fusion of speech and vision modalities. We introduce a use case on assessing 'Relevance' between verbal utterances from the user and visual scene perception of the robot. We present our methodology with a Multimodal Joint Representation module and a Temporal Alignment module, which can allow robots to evaluate relevance by temporally aligning multimodal inputs. Finally, we discuss how the proposed framework for context representation can help with various aspects of explainability in HRI.

# Mitigating the Uncanny Valley Effect in Hyper-Realistic Robots: A Student-Centered Study on LLM-Driven Conversations 

**Authors**: Hangyeol Kang, Thiago Freitas dos Santos, Maher Ben Moussa, Nadia Magnenat-Thalmann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16449)  

**Abstract**: The uncanny valley effect poses a significant challenge in the development and acceptance of hyper-realistic social robots. This study investigates whether advanced conversational capabilities powered by large language models (LLMs) can mitigate this effect in highly anthropomorphic robots. We conducted a user study with 80 participants interacting with Nadine, a hyper-realistic humanoid robot equipped with LLM-driven communication skills. Through pre- and post-interaction surveys, we assessed changes in perceptions of uncanniness, conversational quality, and overall user experience. Our findings reveal that LLM-enhanced interactions significantly reduce feelings of eeriness while fostering more natural and engaging conversations. Additionally, we identify key factors influencing user acceptance, including conversational naturalness, human-likeness, and interestingness. Based on these insights, we propose design recommendations to enhance the appeal and acceptability of hyper-realistic robots in social contexts. This research contributes to the growing field of human-robot interaction by offering empirical evidence on the potential of LLMs to bridge the uncanny valley, with implications for the future development of social robots.

# ACE, Action and Control via Explanations: A Proposal for LLMs to Provide Human-Centered Explainability for Multimodal AI Assistants 

**Authors**: Elizabeth Anne Watkins, Emanuel Moss, Ramesh Manuvinakurike, Meng Shi, Richard Beckwith, Giuseppe Raffa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16466)  

**Abstract**: In this short paper we address issues related to building multimodal AI systems for human performance support in manufacturing domains. We make two contributions: we first identify challenges of participatory design and training of such systems, and secondly, to address such challenges, we propose the ACE paradigm: "Action and Control via Explanations". Specifically, we suggest that LLMs can be used to produce explanations in the form of human interpretable "semantic frames", which in turn enable end users to provide data the AI system needs to align its multimodal models and representations, including computer vision, automatic speech recognition, and document inputs. ACE, by using LLMs to "explain" using semantic frames, will help the human and the AI system to collaborate, together building a more accurate model of humans activities and behaviors, and ultimately more accurate predictive outputs for better task support, and better outcomes for human users performing manual tasks.

# OS-Kairos: Adaptive Interaction for MLLM-Powered GUI Agents 

**Authors**: Pengzhou Cheng, Zheng Wu, Zongru Wu, Aston Zhang, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16465)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language models have shown great promise. However, a critical yet underexplored issue persists: over-execution, where the agent executes tasks in a fully autonomous way, without adequate assessment of its action confidence to compromise an adaptive human-agent collaboration. This poses substantial risks in complex scenarios, such as those involving ambiguous user instructions, unexpected interruptions, and environmental hijacks. To address the issue, we introduce OS-Kairos, an adaptive GUI agent capable of predicting confidence levels at each interaction step and efficiently deciding whether to act autonomously or seek human intervention. OS-Kairos is developed through two key mechanisms: (i) collaborative probing that annotates confidence scores at each interaction step; (ii) confidence-driven interaction that leverages these confidence scores to elicit the ability of adaptive interaction. Experimental results show that OS-Kairos substantially outperforms existing models on our curated dataset featuring complex scenarios, as well as on established benchmarks such as AITZ and Meta-GUI, with 24.59\%$\sim$87.29\% improvements in task success rate. OS-Kairos facilitates an adaptive human-agent collaboration, prioritizing effectiveness, generality, scalability, and efficiency for real-world GUI interaction. The dataset and codes are available at this https URL.

# Situational Agency: The Framework for Designing Behavior in Agent-based art 

**Authors**: Ary-Yue Huang, Varvara Guljajeva  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16442)  

**Abstract**: In the context of artificial life art and agent-based art, this paper draws on Simon Penny's {\itshape Aesthetic of Behavior} theory and Sofian Audry's discussions on behavior computation to examine how artists design agent behaviors and the ensuing aesthetic experiences. We advocate for integrating the environment in which agents operate as the context for behavioral design, positing that the environment emerges through continuous interactions among agents, audiences, and other entities, forming an evolving network of meanings generated by these interactions. Artists create contexts by deploying and guiding these computational systems, audience participation, and agent behaviors through artist strategies. This framework is developed by analysing two categories of agent-based artworks, exploring the intersection of computational systems, audience participation, and artistic strategies in creating aesthetic experiences. This paper seeks to provide a contextual foundation and framework for designing agents' behaviors by conducting a comparative study focused on behavioural design strategies by the artists.
