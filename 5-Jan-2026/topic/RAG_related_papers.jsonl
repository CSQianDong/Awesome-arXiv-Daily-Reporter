However, current RAG approaches focus primarily on performance improvements while overlooking evidence-based medicine (EBM) principles. This study addresses two key gaps: (1) the lack of PICO alignment between queries and retrieved evidence, and (2) the absence of evidence hierarchy considerations during reranking. We present a generalizable strategy for adapting EBM to graph-based RAG, integrating the PICO framework into knowledge graph construction and retrieval, and proposing a Bayesian-inspired reranking algorithm to calibrate ranking scores by evidence grade without introducing predefined weights. We validated this framework in sports rehabilitation, a literature-rich domain currently lacking RAG systems and benchmarks. We released a knowledge graph (357,844 nodes and 371,226 edges) and a reusable benchmark of 1,637 QA pairs. The system achieved 0.830 nugget coverage, 0.819 answer faithfulness, 0.882 semantic similarity, and 0.788 PICOT match accuracy. In a 5-point Likert evaluation, five expert clinicians rated the system 4.66-4.84 across factual accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, safety, and PICO alignment. These findings demonstrate that the proposed EBM adaptation strategy improves retrieval and answer quality and is transferable to other clinical domains. The released resources also help address the scarcity of RAG datasets in sports rehabilitation.'}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2601.00254', 'title': 'An Empirical Evaluation of LLM-Based Approaches for Code Vulnerability Detection: RAG, SFT, and Dual-Agent Systems', 'authors': 'Md Hasan Saju, Maher Muhtadi, Akramul Azim', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00254', 'abstract': 'The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new opportunities for automated software vulnerability detection, a crucial task in securing modern codebases. This paper presents a comparative study on the effectiveness of LLM-based techniques for detecting software vulnerabilities. The study evaluates three approaches, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and a Dual-Agent LLM framework, against a baseline LLM model. A curated dataset was compiled from Big-Vul and real-world code repositories from GitHub, focusing on five critical Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories: CWE-119, CWE-399, CWE-264, CWE-20, and CWE-200. Our RAG approach, which integrated external domain knowledge from the internet and the MITRE CWE database, achieved the highest overall accuracy (0.86) and F1 score (0.85), highlighting the value of contextual augmentation. Our SFT approach, implemented using parameter-efficient QLoRA adapters, also demonstrated strong performance. Our Dual-Agent system, an architecture in which a secondary agent audits and refines the output of the first, showed promise in improving reasoning transparency and error mitigation, with reduced resource overhead. These results emphasize that incorporating a domain expertise mechanism significantly strengthens the practical applicability of LLMs in real-world vulnerability detection tasks.'}
