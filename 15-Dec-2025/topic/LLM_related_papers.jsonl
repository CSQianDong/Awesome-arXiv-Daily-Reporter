Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability."}

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

As a result, LLMs answer without support, hallucinate under incomplete or misleading context, and rely on spurious evidence. We introduce a training framework that treats the entire RAG pipeline -- both the retriever and the generator -- as an interactive proof system via an adaptation of the Merlin-Arthur (M/A) protocol. Arthur (the generator LLM) trains on questions of unkown provenance: Merlin provides helpful evidence, while Morgana injects adversarial, misleading context. Both use a linear-time XAI method to identify and modify the evidence most influential to Arthur. Consequently, Arthur learns to (i) answer when the context support the answer, (ii) reject when evidence is insufficient, and (iii) rely on the specific context spans that truly ground the answer. We further introduce a rigorous evaluation framework to disentangle explanation fidelity from baseline predictive errors. This allows us to introduce and measure the Explained Information Fraction (EIF), which normalizes M/A certified mutual-information guarantees relative to model capacity and imperfect benchmarks. Across three RAG datasets and two model families of varying sizes, M/A-trained LLMs show improved groundedness, completeness, soundness, and reject behavior, as well as reduced hallucinations -- without needing manually annotated unanswerable questions. The retriever likewise improves recall and MRR through automatically generated M/A hard positives and negatives. Our results demonstrate that autonomous interactive-proof-style supervision provides a principled and practical path toward reliable RAG systems that treat retrieved documents not as suggestions, but as verifiable evidence.'}

We are interested in a more general question -- can we understand how the outputs of black-box LLMs depend on each input token? There is a critical need to have such tools in real-world applications that rely on inaccessible API endpoints to language models. However, this is a highly non-trivial problem, as LLMs are stochastic functions (i.e. two outputs will be different by chance), while computing prompt-level gradients to approximate input sensitivity is infeasible. To address this, we propose Distribution-Based Sensitivity Analysis (DBSA), a lightweight model-agnostic procedure to evaluate the sensitivity of the output of a language model for each input token, without making any distributional assumptions about the LLM. DBSA is developed as a practical tool for practitioners, enabling quick, plug-and-play visual exploration of LLMs reliance on specific input tokens.

However, effectively fusing these adapters to handle complex, multi-domain composite queries remains a critical challenge. Existing LoRA fusion approaches either use static weights, which assign equal relevance to each participating LoRA, or require data-intensive supervised training for every possible LoRA combination to obtain respective optimal fusion weights. We propose qa-FLoRA, a novel query-adaptive data-and-training-free method for LoRA fusion that dynamically computes layer-level fusion weights by measuring distributional divergence between the base model and respective adapters. Our approach eliminates the need for composite training data or domain-representative samples, making it readily applicable to existing adapter collections. Extensive experiments across nine multilingual composite tasks spanning mathematics, coding, and medical domains, show that qa-FLoRA outperforms static fusion by ~5% with LLaMA-2 and ~6% with LLaMA-3, and the training-free baselines by ~7% with LLaMA-2 and ~10% with LLaMA-3, while significantly closing the gap with supervised baselines. Further, layer-level analysis of our fusion weights reveals interpretable fusion patterns, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for robust multi-domain adaptation.'}

Lindsell, Chuan Hong', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11261', 'abstract': 'Systematic reviews are a key component of evidence-based medicine, playing a critical role in synthesizing existing research evidence and guiding clinical decisions. However, with the rapid growth of research publications, conducting systematic reviews has become increasingly burdensome, with title and abstract screening being one of the most time-consuming and resource-intensive steps. To mitigate this issue, we designed a two-stage dynamic few-shot learning (DFSL) approach aimed at improving the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in the title and abstract screening task. Specifically, this approach first uses a low-cost LLM for initial screening, then re-evaluates low-confidence instances using a high-performance LLM, thereby enhancing screening performance while controlling computational costs. We evaluated this approach across 10 systematic reviews, and the results demonstrate its strong generalizability and cost-effectiveness, with potential to reduce manual screening burden and accelerate the systematic review process in practical applications.'}

Speculative decoding mitigates this issue by leveraging a smaller draft model to predict candidate tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, existing approaches often require additional training, extensive hyperparameter tuning, or prior analysis of models and tasks before deployment. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Speculative Decoding (AdaSD), a hyperparameter-free decoding scheme that dynamically adjusts generation length and acceptance criteria during inference. AdaSD introduces two adaptive thresholds: one to determine when to stop candidate token generation and another to decide token acceptance, both updated in real time based on token entropy and Jensen-Shannon distance. This approach eliminates the need for pre-analysis or fine-tuning and is compatible with off-the-shelf models. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaSD achieves up to 49\\% speedup over standard speculative decoding while limiting accuracy degradation to under 2\\%, making it a practical solution for efficient and adaptive LLM inference.'}

However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.'}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced this field, current approaches often struggle with a dichotomy of failure: they either generate hallucinated queries without verifying schema existence or exhibit rigid, template-based reasoning that mimics synthesized traces without true comprehension of the environment. To address these limitations, we present \\textbf{KBQA-R1}, a framework that shifts the paradigm from text imitation to interaction optimization via Reinforcement Learning. Treating KBQA as a multi-turn decision process, our model learns to navigate the knowledge base using a list of actions, leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine its strategies based on concrete execution feedback rather than static supervision. Furthermore, we introduce \\textbf{Referenced Rejection Sampling (RRS)}, a data synthesis method that resolves cold-start challenges by strictly aligning reasoning traces with ground-truth action sequences. Extensive experiments on WebQSP, GrailQA, and GraphQuestions demonstrate that KBQA-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively grounding LLM reasoning in verifiable execution.'}

We propose a fast automatic prompt construction algorithm that augments human instructions by generating a small set of few shot examples. Our method iteratively replaces/drops/keeps few-shot examples using Monte Carlo Shapley estimation of example utility. For faster execution, we use aggressive subsampling and a replay buffer for faster evaluations. Our method can be run using different compute time budgets. On a limited budget, we outperform existing automatic prompting methods on text simplification and GSM8K and obtain second best results on classification and summarization. With an extended, but still modest compute budget we set a new state of the art among automatic prompting methods on classification, simplification and GSM8K. Our results show that carefully constructed examples, rather than exhaustive instruction search, are the dominant lever for fast and data efficient prompt engineering.

Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.'}

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to "think in words" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels\'\' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model\'s ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control.'}
