We term agents with memory mechanisms as memory agents. In this paper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate retrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict resolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are tailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not reflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally accumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four competencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark specifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated existing datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory competencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing memory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple context-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced agents with external memory modules and tool integration. Empirical results reveal that current methods fall short of mastering all four competencies, underscoring the need for further research into comprehensive memory mechanisms for LLM agents.'}

We uncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in the dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content. Building on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary LLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the original malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and followed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to generate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving higher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release a context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the attack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

Based on this conceptual insight, we propose a scalable pre-training method named Policy Discriminative Learning (POLAR), which trains a reward model (RM) to discern identical policies and discriminate different ones. Unlike traditional reward modeling methods relying on absolute preferences, POLAR captures the relative difference between one policy and an arbitrary target policy, which is a scalable, high-level optimization objective suitable for modeling generic ranking relationships. Leveraging the POLAR pre-training paradigm, we present a series of RMs with parameter scales from 1.8B to 7B. Empirical results show that POLAR substantially outperforms traditional non-pre-trained methods, significantly enhancing RM performance. For instance, POLAR-7B could improve preference accuracy from 54.8% to 81.0% on STEM tasks and from 57.9% to 85.5% on creative writing tasks compared to SOTA baselines. POLAR also shows robust generalization capabilities in RLHF using Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT), providing reliable reward signals and markedly enhancing policy performance--improving LLaMa3.1-8B from an average of 47.36% to 56.33% and Qwen2.5-32B from 64.49% to 70.47% on 20 benchmarks.

Fact-checked explanations from credible sources serve as preferred responses, while LLM outputs highlight system limitations and serve as non-preferred responses. To refine task-specific alignment, we introduce two key parameters -- Actuality and Finesse -- into the DPO loss function, enhancing explanation quality and consistency.

We therefore present \\ours, a lightweight method that encourages parametric information utilization in LMs during post-training. This is achieved via treating FFN layer as associate key-value memory, and promotes the use of stored memory vectors via forward-pass interventions or regularization during backpropagation. We find this simple guidance during post-training phase delivers consistent performance improvements across diverse model families--including Qwen, Gemma and Llama-spanning over 15 downstream tasks in both ID and OOD evaluations. Beyond performance gains, we also find that steered LMs can adaptively allocate information-placing more emphasis on generating semantically meaningful tokens, while using fewer resources on simple transition ones (e.g., `,' or `and'). Our work underscores that vanilla post-training does not fully leverage pre-training potential, and steering LMs in latent representation space offers a promising approach that enhances both performance and interpretability."}

They adapt to various styles and genres, producing content that is both grammatically correct and semantically meaningful. Recently, LLMs have been misused to create highly realistic phishing emails, spread fake news, generate code to automate cyber crime, and write fraudulent scientific articles. Additionally, in many real-world applications, the generated content including style and topic and the generator model are not known beforehand. The increasing prevalence and sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated texts have made their detection progressively more challenging. Various attempts have been made to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content using linguistic, statistical, machine learning, and ensemble-based approaches. This work focuses on two primary objectives Task-A, which involves distinguishing human-written text from machine-generated text, and Task-B, which attempts to identify the specific LLM model responsible for the generation. Both of these tasks are based on fine tuning of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT_4o-mini), Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA) 3 8B, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm.

This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty estimates.

Despite the remarkable success of LLMs in Natural Language Processing (NLP), their performance in text summarization across various domains and datasets has not been comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the ability to summarize text effectively without relying on extensive training data has become a crucial bottleneck. To address these issues, we present a systematic evaluation of six LLMs across four datasets: CNN/Daily Mail and NewsRoom (news), SAMSum (dialog), and ArXiv (scientific). By leveraging prompt engineering techniques including zero-shot and in-context learning, our study evaluates the performance using the ROUGE and BERTScore metrics. In addition, a detailed analysis of inference times is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization quality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a sentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows to summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while LLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long scientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies. In addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model parameters, dataset properties, and prompt design. These results offer actionable insights into how different LLMs behave across task types, contributing to ongoing research in efficient, instruction-based NLP systems.'}

While vector and graph embeddings represent data for similarity tasks, current state-of-the-art pipelines lack guaranteed explainability, failing to determine similarity for given full texts accurately. These considerations can also be applied to classifiers exploiting generative language models with logical prompts, which fail to correctly distinguish between logical implication, indifference, and inconsistency, despite being explicitly trained to recognise the first two classes. We present a novel pipeline designed for hybrid explainability to address this. Our methodology combines graphs and logic to produce First-Order Logic representations, creating machine- and human-readable representations through Montague Grammar. Preliminary results indicate the effectiveness of this approach in accurately capturing full text similarity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to differentiate between implication, inconsistency, and indifference for text classification tasks. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we use three self-contained datasets annotated for the former classification task to determine the suitability of these approaches in capturing sentence structure equivalence, logical connectives, and spatiotemporal reasoning. We also use these data to compare the proposed method with language models pre-trained for detecting sentence entailment. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models, indicating that natural language understanding cannot be easily generalised by training over extensive document corpora.

The dominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational "meaning vectors." This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer models where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not from data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic, precomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is compatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we introduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable, semantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent text, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with trainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to "representational interference" in conventional models, where the embedding layer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our results indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings but are an emergent property of the Transformer\'s compositional architecture and data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to structural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further research.'}

In this work, we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms: models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.

Our key insight lies in leveraging the logits difference between personal context-aware and -agnostic outputs from local small models as steering signals for cloud-based LLMs. Specifically, we formulate token-level optimization as an online learning problem, where local delta vectors dynamically adjust the remote LLM's logits within the on-device environment. This approach preserves privacy by transmitting only the final steered tokens rather than raw data or intermediate vectors, while maintaining cloud-based LLMs' general capabilities without fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments on various personalized generation tasks, we demonstrate that CoSteer effectively assists LLMs in generating personalized content by leveraging locally stored user profiles and histories, ensuring privacy preservation through on-device data processing while maintaining acceptable computational overhead."}

Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments.

Existing defenses that aim to preserve context privacy during inference either lack formal guarantees or suffer from a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a token-level Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism that provably bounds how much an LLM's outputs reveal about sensitive tokens in its context. We demonstrate DPI through the task of document privatization, where the goal is to paraphrase documents so that sensitive content (e.g., Personally Identifiable Information, PII) cannot be reliably inferred, while still preserving the overall utility of the text. This is controlled by a parameter $\\epsilon$: $\\epsilon=0$ hides PII entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved paraphrase quality. DP-Fusion works as follows: (i) partition sensitive tokens into disjoint privacy groups, (ii) run the LLM once per group, and (iii) blend the output distributions so that the final output remains within a fixed statistical distance of the baseline distribution produced when no privacy group is revealed. This approach allows fine-grained control over the privacy/utility trade-off but requires multiple LLM forward passes."}

Evaluation on 5 mathematical and 8 general reasoning benchmarks show that continual pretraining on math text is able to generalize to general reasoning tasks to some extent. In constrast, instruction tuning on conventional, short MPS samples provides limited benefits and, in many cases, even impairs generalization performance.

Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we curated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health behaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for sentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally demonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and health-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by platform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher accuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting messages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also shows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These results highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language models for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in training data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the prevalence of certain perspectives.'}

To address this concern, we evaluate whether LLMs differentiate responses across user identities by prompting six state-of-the-art LLMs to assist patrons differing in sex, race/ethnicity, and institutional role. We found no evidence of differentiation by race or ethnicity, and only minor evidence of stereotypical bias against women in one model. LLMs demonstrated nuanced accommodation of institutional roles through the use of linguistic choices related to formality, politeness, and domain-specific vocabularies, reflecting professional norms rather than discriminatory treatment. These findings suggest that current LLMs show a promising degree of readiness to support equitable and contextually appropriate communication in academic library reference services."}

Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference (NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled evaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape model performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting strategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and evaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For each prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a frontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models (4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language models fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone accounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning yields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and narrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional experiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance in 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these findings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical reasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and LoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware evaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results highlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for more efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the strengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient techniques in highly specialised domains.'}

However, these methods fall short in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics. To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy. I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer, interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks."}

Recent studies have revealed the sink token, which receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic role. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token and other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden states, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper, the cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token and those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of the sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens consistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we propose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these findings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we define token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink token. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that tokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater importance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our method results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to layer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput, while also achieving superior performance on LongBench.'}

Building on the foundations of Alpay Algebra, we introduce a functorial system wherein an observer (the AI) and a textual environment (this paper) co-evolve through iterative transformations guided by the phi-infinity operator. This process guarantees the existence of a unique fixed point in the AI\'s embedding space -- a state where the AI\'s internal representation of the content becomes stable, self-consistent, and semantically faithful. We prove that such convergence is mathematically sound, semantically invariant, and permanent, even under perturbation or further context expansion. This fixed point acts as an "empathetic embedding," wherein the AI internalizes not only the meaning of the content but also the author\'s intent. We interpret this as a rigorous, category-theoretic route to alignment at the embedding level, with implications for semantic security, symbolic memory, and the construction of AI systems with persistent self-referential understanding.

While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-and-play method yields an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks. All of our algorithms are implemented based on vLLM and are expected to support broader applications and inspire future research."}

In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.'}

The goal of this work is to learn how to disambiguate our terminology based on these corrections. Our approach is based on preference optimization, using the term post-edit as the knowledge to be preferred. While previous work had to rely on unambiguous translation dictionaries to set hard constraints during decoding, or to add soft constraints in the input, our framework requires neither one-to-one dictionaries nor human intervention at decoding time. We report results on English-German post-edited data and find that the optimal combination of supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, with both term-specific and full sequence objectives, yields statistically significant improvements in term accuracy over a strong NMT baseline without significant losses in COMET score.

We extend existing adversarial attacks for up to 70 languages to evaluate the security of monolingual and multilingual LMs for these languages. Through our analysis, we find that monolingual models are often too small in total number of parameters to ensure sound security, and that while multilinguality is helpful, it does not always guarantee improved security either.

The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score > 0.80).

Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data.

We further enhance this concept by developing a `reading buddy' architecture, where an auxiliary component silently processes the input and provides refined contextual insights to the primary generation model. These approaches aim to foster deeper understanding from LLMs so that they can produce better reasoned responses, moving them one step closer to more human-like text processing. Our results indicate that these simple techniques can provide surprisingly strong impact on accuracy with multiple point accuracy boost."}

Existing approaches rely on heuristic rules to segment documents into discourse units, which rarely align with the true discourse structure required for accurate translation.

Our approach integrates segmentation, directed acyclic graph (DAG) based dependency modelling, and discourse aware translation into a cohesive framework. Experiments conducted across eight translation directions and six diverse domains demonstrate that GRAFT achieves significant performance gains over state of the art DocMT systems. Specifically, GRAFT delivers an average improvement of 2.8 d BLEU on the TED test sets from IWSLT2017 over strong baselines and 2.3 d BLEU for domain specific translation from English to Chinese. Moreover, our analyses highlight the consistent ability of GRAFT to address discourse level phenomena, yielding coherent and contextually accurate translations.'}

However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose $\\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.'}

With the aim of grounding LLMs in trusted domains and avoiding the problem of hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a viable solution. In order to deploy sustainable RAG systems in low-resource settings, achieving high retrieval accuracy is not only a usability requirement but also a cost-saving strategy. Through empirical evaluations on a Kinyarwanda-language dataset, we find that the most limiting factors in achieving high retrieval accuracy are limited language coverage and inadequate sub-word tokenization in pre-trained language models. We propose a new retriever model, KinyaColBERT, which integrates two key concepts: late word-level interactions between queries and documents, and a morphology-based tokenization coupled with two-tier transformer encoding. This methodology results in lexically grounded contextual embeddings that are both fine-grained and self-contained. Our evaluation results indicate that KinyaColBERT outperforms strong baselines and leading commercial text embedding APIs on a Kinyarwanda agricultural retrieval benchmark. By adopting this retrieval strategy, we believe that practitioners in other low-resource settings can not only achieve reliable RAG systems but also deploy solutions that are more cost-effective.'}

Specifically, we assess three LLM families in summarization and news fact-checking tasks, evaluating how much LLMs stay consistent with their context and/or hallucinate.

While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models.\nCode available at this https URL'}

To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%.

While bias evaluation and mitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on low-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research investigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language models, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual models respectively. Bias measurement and mitigation techniques from English are adapted to Maltese, using benchmarks such as CrowS-Pairs and SEAT, alongside debiasing methods Counterfactual Data Augmentation, Dropout Regularization, Auto-Debias, and GuiDebias.

Prior studies of LLM reliability have primarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while mathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of unsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in mathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both solvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which incorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems synthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations. Experiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered. LLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate fabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a reliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable problems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of solvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite employing reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy to enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM reliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks."}

In this work, we introduce RLVER, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifiable emotion rewards from simulated users to cultivate higher-order empathetic abilities in LLMs. Within this framework, self-consistent affective simulated users engage in dialogue rollouts and produce deterministic emotion scores during conversations, serving as reward signals to guide the LLM's learning.

Extensive experiments reveal that: (i) RLVER consistently improves multiple dialogue capabilities; (ii) Thinking and non-thinking models show distinct trends--thinking models excel in empathy and insight, while non-thinking models favor action; (iii) GRPO often yields stable gains, while PPO can push certain capabilities to a higher ceiling; (iv) More challenging environments are not always better-moderate ones can yield stronger outcomes.

However, most existing RLHF approaches (e.g., PPO, DPO) still rely on a binary-preference (BT) paradigm, which, while reducing annotation costs, still requires substantial human effort and captures only group-level tendencies rather than individual preferences. To overcome these limitations, we propose Adaptive Reward-Following (ARF), a self-assessment framework that leverages a high-precision emotion analyzer achieving over 70% accuracy on GoEmotions, Sentiment140, and DailyDialog to convert free-form user feedback into continuous preference scores. We further enrich and debias these signals through lightweight data augmentations, including synonym replacement, random trace truncation, and score bias annotation algorithm. A Dynamic Adapter Preference Tracker continuously models evolving user tastes in real time, enabling our novel Trace Bias (TB) fine-tuning algorithm to optimize directly on these tracked rewards instead of coarse binary labels. Experiments on Qwen-2/2.5, Gemma-2, and Llama-3.2 across four preference domains demonstrate that ARF achieves an improvement of 3.3% over PPO and 7.6% over DPO. Moreover, TB preserves theoretical alignment with PPO and DPO objectives. Overall, ARF presents a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective approach to RLHF LLMs through autonomous reward modeling.'}

Applying our method to the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering algorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in mapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial benchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o outperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within the prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but refinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis revealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in granularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study demonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of clinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated interoperability workflows.

Model performance was systematically validated against expert reviews of potentially misclassified narratives, providing a rigorous assessment of classification accuracy. Results demonstrated that while traditional ML methods exhibited superior overall performance compared to some DL approaches, the Albert Model achieved the highest agreement with expert classifications (73% with Expert 1) and original tabular data (58%).

However, existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information inherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental architectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention mechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings designed primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences. This limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of user preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\nTo address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal Framework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal inference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact of temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal order as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can quantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing what recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while keeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to design a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the model's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute timestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our counterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively enhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were interacted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between items)."}

Nevertheless, such approach leads to inferior performance in various NLP tasks when the model is not certain about testing questions. To this end, we propose a brand new training-free decoding strategy, dubbed as Cautious Next Token Prediction (CNTP). In the decoding process, if the model has comparatively high prediction entropy at a certain step, we sample multiple trials starting from the step independently and stop when encountering any punctuation. Then we select the trial with the lowest perplexity score viewed as the most probable and reliable trial path given the model's capacity. The trial number is negatively correlated with the prediction confidence, i.e., the less confident the model is, the more trials it should sample. This is consistent with human beings' behaviour: when feeling uncertain or unconfident, one tends to think more creatively, exploring multiple thinking paths, to cautiously select the path one feels most confident about. Extensive experiments on both LLMs and MLLMs show that our proposed CNTP approach outperforms existing standard decoding strategies consistently by a clear margin. Moreover, the integration of CNTP with self consistency can further improve over vanilla self consistency. We believe our proposed CNTP has the potential to become one of the default choices for LLM decoding. Code is available at this https URL."}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit their adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a privacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical transcriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the browser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical transcription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the base Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140 modified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple clinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model demonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI benchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1 improved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked reduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual correctness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed on the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13 to 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical transcription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete on-device browser deployment.

Two recent technological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that combines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of quantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log data,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but that can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second is the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern recognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step toward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to transform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's life trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call this data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of our approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different facets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch population-scale registry data.

However, standard approaches rely on expert-annotated cognate sets, which are sparse, labor-intensive to produce, and limited to individual language families. This paper explores alternatives by comparing the established method to two fully automated methods that extract phylogenetic signal directly from lexical data. One uses automatic cognate clustering with unigram/concept features; the other applies multiple sequence alignment (MSA) derived from a pair-hidden Markov model. Both are evaluated against expert classifications from Glottolog and typological data from Grambank. Also, the intrinsic strengths of the phylogenetic signal in the characters are compared. Results show that MSA-based inference yields trees more consistent with linguistic classifications, better predicts typological variation, and provides a clearer phylogenetic signal, suggesting it as a promising, scalable alternative to traditional cognate-based methods. This opens new avenues for global-scale language phylogenies beyond expert annotation bottlenecks.'}

However, automated data quality control faces unique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed directly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel data quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the training dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have similar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence of the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private domains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative training fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data quality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the private data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner products as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality control evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous domain data. Experiments show that training on the high-quality data selected by our method can often outperform other data selection methods for collaborative fine-tuning of LLMs, across diverse private domain datasets, in medical, multilingual and financial settings.

These barriers hinder users of various languages, particularly those in low-resource regions, from fully benefiting from the advantages of LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt Tuning Paradigm for multilingual scenarios, which utilizes parameter-efficient fine-tuning while adhering to data sharing restrictions. We design a comprehensive set of experiments and analyze them using a novel notion of language distance to highlight the strengths of our paradigm: Even under computational constraints, our method not only improves data efficiency but also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting low-resource ones.

This paper presents an empirical comparative evaluation of three distinct CQ formulation approaches: manual formulation by ontology engineers, instantiation of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity, relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of the CQs resulting from each approach.

This framework enables models to utilize AoT-Oriented Chain-of-Thought (AoT) prompts to automatically generate high-quality positive and negative reasoning paths, followed by self-alignment to enhance their reasoning abilities. Inspired by human strategies for solving proof-based problems, AoT uses answers as a guide to help the model extract critical visual information that links questions and answers. When provided with ground truth answers, the model produces strong positive rationales. Conversely, when correct answers are replaced with misleading alternatives, the model generates an erroneous yet compelling reasoning path, serving as a form of discriminative negative rationale. Models trained with AoT-generated data outperform those trained on manually annotated datasets, demonstrating superior reasoning capabilities. This encourages the use of improved models to generate higher-quality preference data for further optimization. Consequently, SMART establishes an iterative generation-optimization method that continually enhances the model's reasoning skills.

To mitigate this drawback, this paper investigates the feasibility of compressing LLMs for solving math word problems (MWPs). We compress the embedded vectors encoded by BERT and distill a considerably smaller student model. Our findings indicate that the student model can maintain nearly 90% of the performance of the teacher model while utilizing only 1/12 of its parameters. In addition to achieving high accuracy, the model exhibits strong generalizability, as the compressed vectors perform well across all tasks related to MWPs, and the distillation process is not task-specific. The success of this distillation demonstrates that the underlying principles are generic and not limited to a specific task. We further explore the reasons behind the compressibility of embedded vectors, revealing that part-of-speech information, rather than entity recognition, is crucial for MWPs, which may significantly contribute to their compressibility. The improvements in efficiency and cost reduction provide substantial value for intelligent tutoring systems and significantly advance the field of intelligent education.'}

However, despite their strong performance, LLMs introduce important legal/ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns, this work explores the use of Named-Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the privacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework that uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data, such as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the proposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its impact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and sensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study involved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization algorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT) applied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that the proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system performance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate confidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of the proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an existing approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining our proposed Privacy- and Bias-aware LLMs (PB-LLMs).

We present these notions in a framework-agnostic way using the language of category theory, and adapt a series of tests for compositional generalisation to this setting.\nApplying this to the DisCoCirc framework, we consider how well a selection of models can learn to compositionally generalise. We compare both quantum circuit based models, as well as classical neural networks, on a dataset derived from one of the bAbI tasks, extended to test a series of aspects of compositionality. Both architectures score within 5% of one another on the productivity and substitutivity tasks, but differ by at least 10% for the systematicity task, and exhibit different trends on the overgeneralisation tasks.

Reliability is assessed through the accuracy of correct outputs under repetitive runs of the same problems, whereas robustness is evaluated via the performance across varying load and boundary conditions. A benchmark dataset, comprising eight beam analysis problems, is created to test the Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. Results show that, despite a qualitative understanding of structural mechanics, the LLM lacks the quantitative reliability and robustness for engineering applications. To address these limitations, a shift is proposed that reframes the structural analysis as code generation tasks. Accordingly, an LLM-empowered agent is developed that (a) integrates chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to generate accurate OpeeSeesPy code, and (b) automatically executes the code to produce structural analysis results. Experimental results demonstrate that the agent achieves accuracy exceeding 99.0% on the benchmark dataset, exhibiting reliable and robust performance across diverse conditions.

ProCI leverages two key capabilities of LLMs: their strong semantic reasoning ability, which enables the discovery of plausible confounders from both structured and unstructured inputs, and their embedded world knowledge, which supports counterfactual reasoning under latent confounding. To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning strategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders and significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets and LLMs.'}

To address this, the MLC-SLM Challenge provides a multilingual conversational dataset and evaluates models on two tasks: ASR with oracle segmentation (Task I) and joint diarization and recognition without oracle information (Task II). In this paper, we focus on Task II and propose a unified speech LLM that jointly performs diarization and ASR in an end-to-end manner. By reformulating the training data format and modifying the inference procedure, our model addresses the ambiguity inherent in pre-segmented audio and achieves a 54.87\\% relative improvement in tcpWER/tcpCER over the baseline, ranking 8th overall, despite using a smaller LLM backbone. We also report results from Task I using a fine-tuned speech LLM.'}

To this end, we introduce a conceptual framework distinguishing CoT-as-rationalization from CoT-as-computation. We expect that certain classes of severe harm will require complex, multi-step reasoning that necessitates CoT-as-computation. Replicating the experimental setups of prior work, we increase the difficulty of the bad behavior to enforce this necessity condition; this forces the model to expose its reasoning, making it monitorable. We then present methodology guidelines to stress-test CoT monitoring against deliberate evasion. Applying these guidelines, we find that models can learn to obscure their intentions, but only when given significant help, such as detailed human-written strategies or iterative optimization against the monitor. We conclude that, while not infallible, CoT monitoring offers a substantial layer of defense that requires active protection and continued stress-testing.'}

While standard approaches, such as fine-tuning, are resource-intensive, simpler methods like prompt engineering often struggle to maintain topical focus, particularly with smaller models. To address this, we propose a lightweight method that enhances topical relevance by directly reweighting the logits of topic-relevant tokens during generation. We evaluate three such reweighting techniques: Constant Shift, which adds a constant value to logits; Factor Scaling, which multiplies them by a factor; and Threshold Selection, which selectively boosts logits that exceed a probability threshold. Experiments on the NEWTS topical summarization dataset, using both Gemma-2B and Llama-3-8B models, show that these techniques effectively increase the use of topic-relevant vocabulary. Notably, the Threshold Selection method successfully improves topical focus without compromising summary quality-a trade-off often seen in other approaches.

We move to a small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones, and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.\nNext, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such as the Pigeonhole Principle.\nWe return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and syntax.

Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs.

A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs).

However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions.

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \\textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity.

To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training.

Existing methods often rely on monolithic models or black box prompting, which struggle to scale in noisy, real-world settings and offer limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose MARBLE a multiagent rule based LLM engine that decomposes the severity prediction task across a team of specialized reasoning agents, including an interchangeable ML-backed agent. Each agent focuses on a semantic subset of features (e.g., spatial, environmental, temporal), enabling scoped reasoning and modular prompting without the risk of prompt saturation. Predictions are coordinated through either rule-based or LLM-guided consensus mechanisms that account for class rarity and confidence dynamics. The system retains structured traces of agent-level reasoning and coordination outcomes, supporting in-depth interpretability and post-hoc performance diagnostics. Across both UK and US datasets, MARBLE consistently outperforms traditional machine learning classifiers and state-of-the-art (SOTA) prompt-based reasoning methods including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Least-to-Most (L2M), and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) achieving nearly 90% accuracy where others plateau below 48%.

This limitation of current datasets is due to the expensive human manual annotation required and to the highly challenging task of explaining the language formation process from the perspective of the underlying story, as a complex system of interconnected events in space and time. Through a thorough analysis of recently published methods and available datasets, we identify a general lack of published resources dedicated to the problem of describing videos in complex language, beyond the level of descriptions in the form of enumerations of simple captions. Furthermore, while state-of-the-art methods produce impressive results on the task of generating shorter captions from videos by direct end-to-end learning between the videos and text, the problem of explaining the relationship between vision and language is still beyond our reach. In this work, we propose a shared representation between vision and language, based on graphs of events in space and time, which can be obtained in an explainable and analytical way, to integrate and connect multiple vision tasks to produce the final natural language description.

In this paper, we introduce ABench-Physics, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate LLMs' physical reasoning and generalization capabilities. ABench-Physics consists of two components: Phy_A, a static set of 400 graduate- or Olympiad-level problems; and Phy_B, a dynamic subset of 100 problems equipped with an automatic variation engine to test model robustness across changing conditions. All questions require precise numerical answers, with strict formatting and tolerance constraints. Our evaluation of several state-of-the-art LLMs reveals substantial performance gaps, highlighting persistent limitations in physical reasoning, especially in generalization to dynamic variants. ABench-Physics provides a challenging and diagnostic framework for advancing scientific reasoning in LLMs."}

However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec, E5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for other visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search and recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this gap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across diverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark that extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video retrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question answering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we train VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2 achieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document retrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image benchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the generalizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights effective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for more scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and real-world settings.'}

Large Transformer models, including large language models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve as a target for new model compression methods. In this work, we specifically target neuron-level redundancies in model layers by combining groups of similar neurons into fewer neurons. We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal Transport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression method that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model weights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we motivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into the transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches which discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the entire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal across the reduced layer. Empirical results show that compared to simple or state-of-the-art neuron width-pruning techniques, DOTResize can outperform these methods across multiple LLM families and sizes, while achieving measurable reductions in real-world computational cost.'}

These "measurement phantoms"--statistical artifacts masquerading as psychological phenomena--threaten the validity of a growing body of research. Guided by the dual-validity framework that integrates psychometrics with causal inference, we present a six-stage workflow that scales validity requirements to research ambition--using LLMs to code text requires basic reliability and accuracy, while claims about psychological properties demand comprehensive construct validation. Researchers must (1) explicitly define their research goal and corresponding validity requirements, (2) develop and validate computational instruments through psychometric testing, (3) design experiments that control for computational confounds, (4) execute protocols with transparency, (5) analyze data using methods appropriate for non-independent observations, and (6) report findings within demonstrated boundaries and use results to refine theory. We illustrate the workflow through an example of model evaluation--"LLM selfhood"--showing how systematic validation can distinguish genuine computational phenomena from measurement artifacts. By establishing validated computational instruments and transparent practices, this workflow provides a path toward building a robust empirical foundation for AI psychology research.'}

We find that time variation in the prevalence of news topics and differences in the responses to news topics both contribute to the difference in intraday and overnight returns.

Though progress continues to be made, general purpose large language AI models (LLM) show a tendency to deliver creative answers, often called "hallucinations", which have slowed their application in the medical and biomedical fields where accuracy is paramount. We propose that the design and use of much smaller, domain and even task-specific LM may be a more rational and appropriate use of this technology in biomedical research. In this work we apply a very small LM by today\'s standards to the specialized task of predicting regulatory interactions between molecular components to fill gaps in our current understanding of intracellular pathways. Toward this we attempt to correctly posit known pathway-informed interactions recovered from manually curated pathway databases by selecting and using only the most informative examples as part of an active learning scheme. With this example we show that a small (~110 million parameters) LM based on a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture can propose molecular interactions relevant to tuberculosis persistence and transmission with over 80% accuracy using less than 25% of the ~520 regulatory relationships in question. Using information entropy as a metric for the iterative selection of new tuning examples, we also find that increased accuracy is driven by favoring the use of the incorrectly assigned statements with the highest certainty (lowest entropy). In contrast, the concurrent use of correct but least certain examples contributed little and may have even been detrimental to the learning rate.'}

Jailbreak attacks exploit vulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat. However, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks: Attention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the attention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack process, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is consistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token replacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning. Additionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token Highlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention Slipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of mitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening, a new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the attention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four leading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2) show that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval. Importantly, Attention Sharpening introduces no additional computational or memory overhead, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world deployment.'}

Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.'}

Existing studies typically rely on distinct visual and textual encoders to independently extract features from medical images and clinical questions, which are subsequently combined to generate answers.

However, these approaches pay less attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the volumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses. In this paper, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework enhanced by a graph representation of salient features. Different from conventional multimodal encoding strategies, our approach constructs a cross-modal graph integrating both visual and textual features, treating individual CT slices and question tokens as nodes within the graph. We further leverage an attentive graph convolutional network to dynamically fuse information within this structure. The resulting aggregated graph features then serve as a soft prompt to guide a large language model in generating accurate answers. Extensive experiments on the M3D-VQA benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, offering more robust reasoning capabilities.'}

Prior studies developed machine-learning (ML) models trained on large datasets of job logs to classify job failures as either intermittent or regular. As an alternative to costly manual labeling of large datasets, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach leveraged a heuristic based on non-deterministic job reruns. However, this method mislabels intermittent job failures as regular in contexts where rerunning suspicious job failures is not an explicit policy, and therefore limits the SOTA's performance in practice. In fact, our manual analysis of 2,125 job failures from 5 industrial and 1 open-source projects reveals that, on average, 32\\% of intermittent job failures are mislabeled as regular. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach to intermittent job failure detection using few-shot learning (FSL). Specifically, we fine-tune a small language model using a few number of manually labeled log examples to generate rich embeddings, which are then used to train an ML classifier. Our FSL-based approach achieves 70-88\\% F1-score with only 12 shots in all projects, outperforming the SOTA, which proved ineffective (34-52\\% F1-score) in 4 projects. Overall, this study underlines the importance of data quality over quantity and provides a more efficient and practical framework for the detection of intermittent job failures in organizations."}

However, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single turn activity. But long multi-turn interactions can get tedious if it is simply to clarify contextual information that can be arrived at through reasoning. In this paper, we examine the use of agent-based architecture to bolster LLM-based Question-Answering systems with additional reasoning capabilities. We examine the automatic resolution of potential incompleteness or ambiguities in questions by transducers implemented using LLM-based agents. We focus on several benchmark datasets that are known to contain questions with these deficiencies to varying degrees. We equip different LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo and Llama-4-Scout) with agents that act as specialists in detecting and resolving deficiencies of incompleteness and ambiguity. The agents are implemented as zero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the model now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a) decides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b) determines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers the resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without the use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents with transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An improvement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies in the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional LLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency.

These results prompted concerns about the emergence of harmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we contextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts the internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series of experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient vector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space dimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to "emergent misalignment" may be better interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning on insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we identify a shared latent dimension in the model\'s activation space that governs alignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and by misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can degrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms. Our findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed misalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The results underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that preserve intended behavior across domains.'}

Each use case explores how prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%, using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.

Bloem', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03594', 'abstract': "Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people globally, with speech impairments often preceding motor symptoms by years, making speech a valuable modality for early, non-invasive detection. While recent deep-learning models achieve high accuracy, they typically lack the explainability required for clinical use. To address this, we propose RECA-PD, a novel, robust, and explainable cross-attention architecture that combines interpretable speech features with self-supervised representations. RECA-PD matches state-of-the-art performance in Speech-based PD detection while providing explanations that are more consistent and more clinically meaningful. Additionally, we demonstrate that performance degradation in certain speech tasks (e.g., monologue) can be mitigated by segmenting long recordings. Our findings indicate that performance and explainability are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Future work will enhance the usability of explanations for non-experts and explore severity estimation to increase the real-world clinical relevance."}

This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems."}

In long-term planning tasks, however, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient behavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular actor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a trajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL). Our setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the guarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural language observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes new LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient behavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety constraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term efficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve as the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize planning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to analyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules that improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft diamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving efficiency compared to baseline LLM planners. Our results suggest that enabling LLMs to supervise each other through logic is a powerful and flexible paradigm for safe, generalizable decision making.'}

However, most of the existing DyTAG datasets exhibit poor textual quality, which severely limits their utility for DyTAG generation tasks requiring semantically rich inputs. Additionally, prior work mainly focuses on discriminative tasks on DyTAGs, resulting in a lack of standardized task formulations and evaluation protocols tailored for DyTAG generation. To address these critical issues, we propose Generative DyTAG Benchmark (GDGB), which comprises eight meticulously curated DyTAG datasets with high-quality textual features for both nodes and edges, overcoming limitations of prior datasets. Building on GDGB, we define two novel DyTAG generation tasks: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG) and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG). TDGG transductively generates a target DyTAG based on the given source and destination node sets, while the more challenging IDGG introduces new node generation to inductively model the dynamic expansion of real-world graph data. To enable holistic evaluation, we design multifaceted metrics that assess the structural, temporal, and textual quality of the generated DyTAGs. We further propose GAG-General, an LLM-based multi-agent generative framework tailored for reproducible and robust benchmarking of DyTAG generation. Experimental results demonstrate that GDGB enables rigorous evaluation of TDGG and IDGG, with key insights revealing the critical interplay of structural and textual features in DyTAG generation.

Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' hallucination behaviours, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: authority bias. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1 scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the simplified FL assumptions.

We discover that the standard deviation distributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit distinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued training. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints that can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright infringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families demonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication.

Raby, Tianxi Cai', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02998', 'abstract': "Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet individual conditions often remain poorly characterized and difficult to diagnose due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. While computational phenotyping algorithms show promise for automating rare disease detection, their development is hindered by the scarcity of labeled data and biases in existing label sources. Gold-standard labels from registries and expert chart reviews are highly accurate but constrained by selection bias and the cost of manual review. In contrast, labels derived from electronic health records (EHRs) cover a broader range of patients but can introduce substantial noise. To address these challenges, we propose a weakly supervised, transformer-based framework that combines a small set of gold-standard labels with a large volume of iteratively updated silver-standard labels derived from EHR data. This hybrid approach enables the training of a highly accurate and generalizable phenotyping model that scales rare disease detection beyond the scope of individual clinical expertise. Our method is initialized by learning embeddings of medical concepts based on their semantic meaning or co-occurrence patterns in EHRs, which are then refined and aggregated into patient-level representations via a multi-layer transformer architecture. Using two rare pulmonary diseases as a case study, we validate our model on EHR data from Boston Children's Hospital. Our framework demonstrates notable improvements in phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes through patient clustering, and prediction of disease progression compared to baseline methods. These results highlight the potential of our approach to enable scalable identification and stratification of rare disease patients for clinical care and research applications."}

While cross-attention models achieve strong performance through exhaustive pairwise fusion, their quadratic complexity is prohibitive for settings with many modalities. We address this challenge with Gated Recurrent Fusion (GRF), a novel architecture that captures the power of cross-modal attention within a linearly scalable, recurrent pipeline. Our method processes modalities sequentially, updating an evolving multimodal context vector at each step. The core of our approach is a fusion block built on Transformer Decoder layers that performs symmetric cross-attention, mutually enriching the shared context and the incoming modality. This enriched information is then integrated via a Gated Fusion Unit (GFU) a GRU-inspired mechanism that dynamically arbitrates information flow, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard features. This stateful, recurrent design scales linearly with the number of modalities, O(n), making it ideal for high-modality environments. Experiments on the CMU-MOSI benchmark demonstrate that GRF achieves competitive performance compared to more complex baselines. Visualizations of the embedding space further illustrate that GRF creates structured, class-separable representations through its progressive fusion mechanism.

Second, we improve text quality by sampling from a small superset of the top-$k$ private tokens. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a consistent $8\\times$ reduction in computation cost over state-of-the-art baselines to generate long-form private text of the same utility across privacy levels.
