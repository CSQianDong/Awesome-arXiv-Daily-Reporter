However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2\\% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4\\% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8\\% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2\\% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1\\% on the full dataset.

In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x).

Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews. To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests. The results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers. Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions.

Experimental results confirm that the competition can boost agents' capacity for innovative thinking, which can significantly improve the performances of time series prediction.

Recent work on long Chain-of-Thought reasoning has demonstrated great potential of LLMs on solving competitive problems, but their verification ability remains to be weak and not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, we propose Heimdall, the long CoT verification LLM that can accurately judge the correctness of solutions. With pure reinforcement learning, we boost the verification accuracy from 62.5% to 94.5% on competitive math problems. By scaling with repeated sampling, the accuracy further increases to 97.5%. Through human evaluation, Heimdall demonstrates impressive generalization capabilities, successfully detecting most issues in challenging math proofs, the type of which is not included during training. Furthermore, we propose Pessimistic Verification to extend the functionality of Heimdall to scaling up the problem solving. It calls Heimdall to judge the solutions from a solver model and based on the pessimistic principle, selects the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty.

By leveraging the Kolmogorov Structure Function and interpreting LLM compression as a two-part coding process, we offer a detailed view of how LLMs acquire and store information across increasing model and data scales -- from pervasive syntactic patterns to progressively rarer knowledge elements. Motivated by this theoretical perspective and natural assumptions inspired by Heap's and Zipf's laws, we introduce a simplified yet representative hierarchical data-generation framework called the Syntax-Knowledge model. Under the Bayesian setting, we show that prediction and compression within this model naturally lead to diverse learning and scaling behaviors of LLMs. In particular, our theoretical analysis offers intuitive and principled explanations for both data and model scaling laws, the dynamics of knowledge acquisition during training and fine-tuning, factual knowledge hallucinations in LLMs. The experimental results validate our theoretical predictions."}

However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques.

A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.'}

Nevertheless, we observe that local cultural information persists within the models and can be readily activated for cultural customization. We first demonstrate that explicitly providing cultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to generate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model performance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit localization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs, it may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context is not explicitly provided. Despite the explicit prompting benefit, however, the answers reduce in diversity and tend toward stereotypes. Second, we identify an explicit cultural customization vector, conserved across all non-English languages we explore, which enables LLMs to be steered from the synthetic English cultural world-model toward each non-English cultural world. Steered responses retain the diversity of implicit prompting and reduce stereotypes to dramatically improve the potential for customization. We discuss the implications of explicit cultural customization for understanding the conservation of alternative cultural world models within LLMs, and their controllable utility for translation, cultural customization, and the possibility of making the explicit implicit through soft control for expanded LLM function and appeal."}

To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques.

However, existing simulators lack the fidelity to model these heterogeneous, multi-engine workflows, limiting their ability to inform architectural decisions.\nTo address this gap, we introduce HERMES, a Heterogeneous Multi-stage LLM inference Execution Simulator. HERMES models diverse request stages; including RAG, KV retrieval, reasoning, prefill, and decode across complex hardware hierarchies. HERMES supports heterogeneous clients executing multiple models concurrently unlike prior frameworks while incorporating advanced batching strategies and multi-level memory hierarchies. By integrating real hardware traces with analytical modeling, HERMES captures critical trade-offs such as memory bandwidth contention, inter-cluster communication latency, and batching efficiency in hybrid CPU-accelerator deployments. Through case studies, we explore the impact of reasoning stages on end-to-end latency, optimal batching strategies for hybrid pipelines, and the architectural implications of remote KV cache retrieval. HERMES empowers system designers to navigate the evolving landscape of LLM inference, providing actionable insights into optimizing hardware-software co-design for next-generation AI workloads.'}

Although LLMs are observed to be vulnerable against prompt injection attacks from external data sources, tabular agents impose strict data formats and predefined rules on the attacker's payload, which are ineffective unless the agent navigates multiple layers of structural data to incorporate the payload. To address the challenge, we present a novel attack termed StruPhantom which specifically targets black-box LLM-powered tabular agents. Our attack designs an evolutionary optimization procedure which continually refines attack payloads via the proposed constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search augmented by an off-topic evaluator. StruPhantom helps systematically explore and exploit the weaknesses of target applications to achieve goal hijacking. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of StruPhantom across various LLM-based agents, including those on real-world platforms, and attack scenarios. Our attack achieves over 50% higher success rates than baselines in enforcing the application's response to contain phishing links or malicious codes."}

For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.'}

Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations.\nMigration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling. Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete. Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations.\nIn this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned.\nOur case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations.\nOur results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.'}

By leveraging large language models (LLMs) for neural architecture search (NAS), a vision transformer (ViT)-based knowledge distillation (KD) strategy, and an explainability module, the approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage. The LLM-guided search explores a hierarchical search space, refining candidate architectures through Pareto optimization based on accuracy, multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and memory metrics. The best-performing architectures are further fine-tuned using logits-based KD with a pre-trained ViT-B/16 model, which enhances generalization without increasing model size. Evaluated on the CIFAR-100 dataset and deployed on an STM32H7 microcontroller (MCU), the three proposed models, LMaNet-Elite, LMaNet-Core, and QwNet-Core, achieve accuracy scores of 74.50%, 74.20% and 73.00%, respectively.

We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM\'s existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone\'\' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k\'\' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\\% while preserving the model\'s ability to learn new information.

In this paper, we extend the XNLI task for one additional low-resource language, Myanmar, as a proxy challenge for broader low-resource languages, and make three core contributions. First, we build a dataset called Myanmar XNLI (myXNLI) using community crowd-sourced methods, as an extension to the existing XNLI corpus. This involves a two-stage process of community-based construction followed by expert verification; through an analysis, we demonstrate and quantify the value of the expert verification stage in the context of community-based construction for low-resource languages.

Second, we carry out evaluations of recent multilingual language models on the myXNLI benchmark, as well as explore data-augmentation methods to improve model performance.

We propose a novel cryptographic embedding framework that enables covert Public Key or Symmetric Key encrypted communication over public chat channels with humanlike produced texts. Some unique properties of our framework are: 1. It is LLM agnostic, i.e., it allows participants to use different local LLM models independently; 2. It is pre- or post-quantum agnostic; 3. It ensures indistinguishability from human-like chat-produced texts. Thus, it offers a viable alternative where traditional encryption is detectable and restricted.'}

Following the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore utilizing LLMs for generating RTL code. However, current studies primarily focus on generating simple single modules, which can not meet the demands in real world. In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL code and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle large-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the first endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we propose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level Verilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world, along with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning. The optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context by retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are carried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting strategy, and the chunk size.

Several works have investigated this question in various ways, finding that there are biases present in the cultural representations of LLM outputs. To gain a more comprehensive view, in this work, we conduct the first large-scale evaluation of LLM culture assessing 20 countries' cultures and languages across ten LLMs. With a renowned cultural values questionnaire and by carefully analyzing LLM output with human ground truth scores, we thoroughly study LLMs' cultural alignment across countries and among individual models. Our findings show that the output over all models represents a moderate cultural middle ground. Given the overall skew, we propose an alignment metric, revealing that the United States is the best-aligned country and GLM-4 has the best ability to align to cultural values. Deeper investigation sheds light on the influence of model origin, prompt language, and value dimensions on cultural output. Specifically, models, regardless of where they originate, align better with the US than they do with China. The conclusions provide insight to how LLMs can be better aligned to various cultures as well as provoke further discussion of the potential for LLMs to propagate cultural bias and the need for more culturally adaptable models."}

Despite significant advances in safety frameworks and guardrails, current protective measures exhibit crucial vulnerabilities, particularly in multilingual contexts. Existing safety systems remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in low-resource languages and through code-switching techniques, primarily due to their English-centric design. Furthermore, the development of effective multilingual guardrails is constrained by the scarcity of diverse cross-lingual training data. Even recent solutions like Llama Guard-3, while offering multilingual support, lack transparency in their decision-making processes. We address these challenges by introducing X-Guard agent, a transparent multilingual safety agent designed to provide content moderation across diverse linguistic contexts. X-Guard effectively defends against both conventional low-resource language attacks and sophisticated code-switching attacks. Our approach includes: curating and enhancing multiple open-source safety datasets with explicit evaluation rationales; employing a jury of judges methodology to mitigate individual judge LLM provider biases; creating a comprehensive multilingual safety dataset spanning 132 languages with 5 million data points; and developing a two-stage architecture combining a custom-finetuned mBART-50 translation module with an evaluation X-Guard 3B model trained through supervised finetuning and GRPO training.

To address these challenges, we introduce AdaptRec, a self-adaptive fram-ework that leverages LLMs for sequential recommendations by incorporating explicit collaborative signals. AdaptRec employs a two-phase user selection mechanism -- User Similarity Retrieval and Self-Adaptive User Selection -- to efficiently identify relevant user sequences in large-scale datasets from multi-metric evaluation.

An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, mechanisms underlying LLM behaviors need to be studied for better methodological validity. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. To ground the theory for empirical analysis, we also propose a novel mechanistic interpretability method alongside a tailored empirical analytic framework. Based on the frameworks, we conduct experiments demonstrating three key claims: first, that distinct dysfunctional and problematic representational states are implemented in LLMs; second, that their activations can spread and self-sustain to trap LLMs; and third, that dynamic, cyclic structural causal models encoded in the LLMs underpin these patterns. In concert, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing.

We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation."}

To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance.

Copy creation is inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by successive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and expensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation restricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the manual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content does not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to humans). While recent studies have shown promise in improving constrained generation through iterative refinement, they have primarily addressed tasks with only a few simple constraints. Consequently, the effectiveness of iterative refinement for tasks such as copy generation, which involves many intricate constraints, remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-based end-to-end framework for scalable copy generation using iterative refinement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address multiple challenging constraints simultaneously in copy generation. Examples of these constraints include length, topics, keywords, preferred lexical ordering, and tone of voice. We demonstrate the performance of our framework by creating copies for e-commerce banners for three different use cases of varying complexity. Our results show that iterative refinement increases the copy success rate by $16.25-35.91$% across use cases. Furthermore, the copies generated using our approach outperformed manually created content in multiple pilot studies using a multi-armed bandit framework. The winning copy improved the click-through rate by $38.5-45.21$%.'}

In this position paper, we begin by examining the insufficiency of existing LM benchmarks, highlighting their limited applicability to real-world use cases. Next, we propose a set of granular evaluation parameters that capture dimensions of LM behavior that are more meaningful to stakeholders across a variety of application domains. Specifically, we introduce the concept of context-agnostic parameters - such as robustness, coherence, and epistemic honesty - and context-specific parameters that must be tailored to the specific contextual constraints and demands of stakeholders choosing to deploy LMs into a particular setting. We then discuss potential approaches to operationalize this evaluation framework, finishing with the opportunities and challenges DICE presents to the LM evaluation landscape. Ultimately, this work serves as a practical and approachable starting point for context-specific and stakeholder-relevant evaluation of LMs.'}

In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in encoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency.

However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive knowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results. Thus, effectively erasing private information from retrieved documents is a key challenge for RAG. Unlike traditional text anonymization, RAG should consider: (1) the inherent multi-document reasoning may face de-anonymization attacks; (2) private knowledge varies by scenarios, so users should be allowed to customize which information to erase; (3) preserving sufficient publicly available knowledge for generation tasks. This paper introduces the privacy erasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which effectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while preserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first construct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across documents, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly split it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite the retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm optimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public triples retention.

By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling.

To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation.

We propose a new novelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the harmonic mean of the fraction of \\ngrams unseen during training and a task-specific quality score. We evaluate the novelty of generations from two families of open-data models (OLMo and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry writing, and creative tool use. We find that LLM generated text is less novel than human written text. To elicit more novel outputs, we experiment with various inference-time methods, which reveals a trade-off between originality and quality. While these methods can boost novelty, they do so by increasing originality at the expense of quality. In contrast, increasing model size or applying post-training reliably shifts the Pareto frontier, highlighting that starting with a stronger base model is a more effective way to improve novelty.'}

The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.'}

By employing a simple discriminator, we detect potential malicious traits during the decoding phase. Upon detecting features indicative of toxic tokens, FMM regenerates the current token. By employing activation patching, an additional rejection vector is incorporated during the subsequent token generation, steering the model towards a refusal response.

Advancements in the naturalness of human-computer interaction correlates with improvements in AI systems' abilities to understand humor. In this study, we assess the ability of models in accurately identifying humorous quotes from a stand-up comedy transcript. Stand-up comedy's unique comedic narratives make it an ideal dataset to improve the overall naturalness of comedic understanding. We propose a novel humor detection metric designed to evaluate LLMs amongst various prompts on their capability to extract humorous punchlines. The metric has a modular structure that offers three different scoring methods - fuzzy string matching, sentence embedding, and subspace similarity - to provide an overarching assessment of a model's performance. The model's results are compared against those of human evaluators on the same task. Our metric reveals that regardless of prompt engineering, leading models, ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, achieve scores of at most 51% in humor detection.

This results in smaller, more specific hypotheses being favored over more general ones. For instance, when provided the set {Austin, Dallas, Houston}, one is more likely to think that this is sampled from "Texas Cities" over "US Cities" even though both are compatible. Suspicious coincidence is strongly connected to pragmatic reasoning, and can serve as a testbed to analyze systems on their sensitivity towards the communicative goals of the task (i.e., figuring out the true category underlying the data). In this paper, we analyze whether suspicious coincidence effects are reflected in language models\' (LMs) behavior. We do so in the context of two domains: 1) the number game, where humans made judgments of whether a number (e.g., 4) fits a list of given numbers (e.g., 16, 32, 2); and 2) by extending the number game setup to prominent cities. For both domains, the data is compatible with multiple hypotheses and we study which hypothesis is most consistent with the models\' behavior. On analyzing five models, we do not find strong evidence for suspicious coincidences in LMs\' zero-shot behavior. However, when provided access to the hypotheses space via chain-of-thought or explicit prompting, LMs start to show an effect resembling suspicious coincidences, sometimes even showing effects consistent with humans. Our study suggests that inductive reasoning behavior in LMs can be enhanced with explicit access to the hypothesis landscape.'}

Our approach stratifies models by parameter count into Small (<4B), Medium (4B-10B), and Large (>10B) categories and compares prompting techniques including Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Analogical, Generated Knowledge, and Tree-of-Thought.

Structured reasoning prompts frequently increased hallucination up to 75% in small models and led to longer response times (over 20 seconds in Large MLLMs), while simpler prompting methods provided more concise and efficient outputs. No single prompting method uniformly optimises all task types.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce CPRec -- an All-domain Continual Pre-Training framework for Recommendation -- designed to holistically align LLMs with universal user behaviors through the continual pre-training paradigm. Specifically, we first design a unified prompt template and organize users' multi-domain behaviors into domain-specific behavioral sequences and all-domain mixed behavioral sequences that emulate real-world user decision logic.

As such, there is strong motivation to develop methods that can predict item difficulty at scale using only the item content. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier for this goal. The present research examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty for K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation approaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the LLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based strategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features, which were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient boosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate to strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy varied by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast, the feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with correlations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both direct LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on extensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature extraction.

However, a notable limitation lies in their inability to effectively model sparse identifiers (e.g., user and item IDs), unlike conventional collaborative filtering models (Collabs.), thus hindering LLM to learn distinctive user-item representations and creating a performance bottleneck. Prior studies indicate that integrating collaborative knowledge from Collabs. into LLMs can mitigate the above limitations and enhance their recommendation performance. Nevertheless, the significant discrepancy in knowledge distribution and semantic space between LLMs and Collab. presents substantial challenges for effective knowledge transfer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework, SeLLa-Rec, which focuses on achieving alignment between the semantic spaces of Collabs. and LLMs. This alignment fosters effective knowledge fusion, mitigating the influence of discriminative noise and facilitating the deep integration of knowledge from diverse models. Specifically, three special tokens with collaborative knowledge are embedded into the LLM's semantic space through a hybrid projection layer and integrated into task-specific prompts to guide the recommendation process. Experiments conducted on two public benchmark datasets (MovieLens-1M and Amazon Book) demonstrate that SeLLa-Rec achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

Traditionally, these recommendations heavily rely on historical search logs to build models, which suffer from cold-start or long-tail issues. Furthermore, tasks such as query suggestion, completion or clarification are studied separately by specific design, which lacks generalizability and hinders adaptation to novel applications. Despite recent attempts to explore the use of LLMs for query recommendation, these methods mainly rely on the inherent knowledge of LLMs or external sources like few-shot examples, retrieved documents, or knowledge bases, neglecting the importance of the calibration and alignment with user feedback, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these challenges, we first propose a general Generative Query Recommendation (GQR) framework that aligns LLM-based query generation with user preference. Specifically, we unify diverse query recommendation tasks by a universal prompt framework, leveraging the instruct-following capability of LLMs for effective generation. Secondly, we align LLMs with user feedback via presenting a CTR-alignment framework, which involves training a query-wise CTR predictor as a process reward model and employing list-wise preference alignment to maximize the click probability of the generated query list. Furthermore, recognizing the inconsistency between LLM knowledge and proactive search intents arising from the separation of user-initiated queries from models, we align LLMs with user initiative via retrieving co-occurrence queries as side information when historical logs are available.'}

However, traditional Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) methods face challenges like complex entity disambiguation, rigid schema definition, and insufficient cross-document knowledge integration. This paper focuses on the task of automatic document-level knowledge graph construction. It proposes the Document-level Retrieval Augmented Knowledge Graph Construction (RAKG) framework. RAKG extracts pre-entities from text chunks and utilizes these pre-entities as queries for RAG, effectively addressing the issue of long-context forgetting in LLMs and reducing the complexity of Coreference Resolution. In contrast to conventional KGC methods, RAKG more effectively captures global information and the interconnections among disparate nodes, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model. Additionally, we transfer the RAG evaluation framework to the KGC field and filter and evaluate the generated knowledge graphs, thereby avoiding incorrectly generated entities and relationships caused by hallucinations in LLMs. We further developed the MINE dataset by constructing standard knowledge graphs for each article and experimentally validated the performance of RAKG. The results show that RAKG achieves an accuracy of 95.91 % on the MINE dataset, a 6.2 % point improvement over the current best baseline, GraphRAG (89.71 %).

Although LLMs can process multimodal information through projection functions that map visual features into their semantic space, recommendation tasks often require representing users' history interactions through lengthy prompts combining text and visual elements, which not only hampers training and inference efficiency but also makes it difficult for the model to accurately capture user preferences from complex and extended prompts, leading to reduced recommendation performance. To address this challenge, we introduce HistLLM, an innovative multimodal recommendation framework that integrates textual and visual features through a User History Encoding Module (UHEM), compressing multimodal user history interactions into a single token representation, effectively facilitating LLMs in processing user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed mechanism."}

The Hybrid Document RAG task aims to integrate textual and hierarchical tabular data for more comprehensive retrieval and generation in complex scenarios. However, there is no existing dataset specifically designed for this task that includes both text and tabular data. Additionally, existing methods struggle to retrieve relevant tabular data and integrate it with text. Semantic similarity-based retrieval lacks accuracy, while table-specific methods fail to handle complex hierarchical structures effectively. Furthermore, the QA task requires complex reasoning and calculations, further complicating the challenge. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale dataset, DocRAGLib, specifically designed for the question answering (QA) task scenario under Hybrid Document RAG. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HD-RAG, a novel framework that incorporates a row-and-column level (RCL) table representation, employs a two-stage process combining ensemble and LLM-based retrieval, and integrates RECAP, which is designed for multi-step reasoning and complex calculations in Document-QA tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments with DocRAGLib, showing that HD-RAG outperforms existing baselines in both retrieval accuracy and QA performance, demonstrating its effectiveness.'}

One notable application is Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the presence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted treatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However, understanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive research. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands significant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of research papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their relation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models (LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in building causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore this, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25 years and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD biomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature of the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and scientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We find that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal networks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in identifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited. We hope this study will inspire further foundational research on AI-driven analysis of AD biomarkers causal network discovery."}

Such a task remains difficult because assessing whether a table is relevant to a problem does not always depend only on its content but also on the context, which is usually tribal knowledge known to the individual or team. While tools like data catalogs and academic data discovery systems target this problem, they rely on keyword search or more complex interfaces, limiting non-technical users' ability to find relevant data. The advent of large language models (LLMs) offers a unique opportunity for users to ask questions directly in natural language, making dataset discovery more intuitive, accessible, and efficient.\nIn this paper, we introduce Pneuma, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to efficiently and effectively discover tabular data. Pneuma leverages large language models (LLMs) for both table representation and table retrieval. For table representation, Pneuma preserves schema and row-level information to ensure comprehensive data understanding. For table retrieval, Pneuma augments LLMs with traditional information retrieval techniques, such as full-text and vector search, harnessing the strengths of both to improve retrieval performance. To evaluate Pneuma, we generate comprehensive benchmarks that simulate table discovery workload on six real-world datasets including enterprise data, scientific databases, warehousing data, and open data. Our results demonstrate that Pneuma outperforms widely used table search systems (such as full-text search and state-of-the-art RAG systems) in accuracy and resource efficiency."}
