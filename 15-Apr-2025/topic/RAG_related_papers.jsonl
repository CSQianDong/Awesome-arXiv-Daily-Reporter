However, these models still rely solely on their parametric knowledge, which limits their ability to generate up-to-date information and increases the risk of producing erroneous content. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates these challenges by incorporating external data sources, yet the reliance on databases and retrieval systems can introduce irrelevant or inaccurate documents, ultimately undermining both performance and reasoning quality. In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Knowledge-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMKB-RAG), a novel multi-modal RAG framework that leverages the inherent knowledge boundaries of models to dynamically generate semantic tags for the retrieval process. This strategy enables the joint filtering of retrieved documents, retaining only the most relevant and accurate references. Extensive experiments on knowledge-based visual question-answering tasks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach: on the E-VQA dataset, our method improves performance by +4.2\\% on the Single-Hop subset and +0.4\\% on the full dataset, while on the InfoSeek dataset, it achieves gains of +7.8\\% on the Unseen-Q subset, +8.2\\% on the Unseen-E subset, and +8.1\\% on the full dataset. These results highlight significant enhancements in both accuracy and robustness over the current state-of-the-art MLLM and RAG frameworks.'}

However, the diverse range of data sources -- including structured statistics, semi-structured formats like sensor data, and unstructured media such as written articles, audio, and video -- creates substantial challenges in extracting actionable insights. These various formats, often referred to as multimodal data, require integration to fully leverage their potential. Conventional systems, which typically prioritize structured data, face limitations when processing and combining these diverse content types, reducing their effectiveness in real-time sports analysis.\nTo address these challenges, recent research highlights the importance of multimodal data integration for capturing the complexity of real-world sports environments. Building on this foundation, this paper introduces GridMind, a multi-agent framework that unifies structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to facilitate natural language querying of NFL data. This approach aligns with the evolving field of multimodal representation learning, where unified models are increasingly essential for real-time, cross-modal interactions.\nGridMind's distributed architecture includes specialized agents that autonomously manage each stage of a prompt -- from interpretation and data retrieval to response synthesis.

In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL code and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle large-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the first endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we propose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level Verilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world, along with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning. The optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context by retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are carried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting strategy, and the chunk size.

The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization.

The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms.

However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive knowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results.

This paper introduces the privacy erasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which effectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while preserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first construct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across documents, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly split it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite the retrieved documents excluding private triples.

One notable application is Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, where certain biomarkers may influence the presence of others, enabling early detection, precise disease staging, targeted treatments, and improved monitoring of disease progression. However, understanding these causal relationships is complex and requires extensive research. Constructing a comprehensive causal network of biomarkers demands significant effort from human experts, who must analyze a vast number of research papers, and have bias in understanding diseases' biomarkers and their relation. This raises an important question: Can advanced large language models (LLMs), such as those utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), assist in building causal networks of biomarkers for further medical analysis? To explore this, we collected 200 AD-related research papers published over the past 25 years and then integrated scientific literature with RAG to extract AD biomarkers and generate causal relations among them. Given the high-risk nature of the medical diagnosis, we applied uncertainty estimation to assess the reliability of the generated causal edges and examined the faithfulness and scientificness of LLM reasoning using both automatic and human evaluation. We find that RAG enhances the ability of LLMs to generate more accurate causal networks from scientific papers. However, the overall performance of LLMs in identifying causal relations of AD biomarkers is still limited.
