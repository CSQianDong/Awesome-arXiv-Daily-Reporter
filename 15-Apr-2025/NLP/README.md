**Authors**: Ding Chen, Qingchen Yu, Pengyuan Wang, Wentao Zhang, Bo Tang, Feiyu Xiong, Xinchi Li, Minchuan Yang, Zhiyu Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10481)  

**Abstract**: With the release of the o1 model by OpenAI, reasoning models adopting slow thinking strategies have gradually emerged. As the responses generated by such models often include complex reasoning, intermediate steps, and self-reflection, existing evaluation methods are often inadequate. They struggle to determine whether the LLM output is truly equivalent to the reference answer, and also have difficulty identifying and extracting the final answer from long, complex responses. To address this issue, we propose xVerify, an efficient answer verifier for reasoning model evaluations. xVerify demonstrates strong capability in equivalence judgment, enabling it to effectively determine whether the answers produced by reasoning models are equivalent to reference answers across various types of objective questions. To train and evaluate xVerify, we construct the VAR dataset by collecting question-answer pairs generated by multiple LLMs across various datasets, leveraging multiple reasoning models and challenging evaluation sets designed specifically for reasoning model assessment. A multi-round annotation process is employed to ensure label accuracy. Based on the VAR dataset, we train multiple xVerify models of different scales. In evaluation experiments conducted on both the test set and generalization set, all xVerify models achieve overall F1 scores and accuracy exceeding 95\%. Notably, the smallest variant, xVerify-0.5B-I, outperforms all evaluation methods except GPT-4o, while xVerify-3B-Ib surpasses GPT-4o in overall performance. These results validate the effectiveness and generalizability of xVerify.

**Authors**: Minqian Liu, Zhiyang Xu, Xinyi Zhang, Heajun An, Sarvech Qadir, Qi Zhang, Pamela J. Wisniewski, Jin-Hee Cho, Sang Won Lee, Ruoxi Jia, Lifu Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10430)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to approach human-level persuasion capabilities. However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PersuSafety, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PersuSafety covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies. Our study calls for more attention to improve safety alignment in progressive and goal-driven conversations such as persuasion.

# Can We Edit LLMs for Long-Tail Biomedical Knowledge? 

**Authors**: Xinhao Yi, Jake Lever, Kevin Bryson, Zaiqiao Meng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10421)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge editing has emerged as an effective approach for updating large language models (LLMs) by modifying their internal knowledge. However, their application to the biomedical domain faces unique challenges due to the long-tailed distribution of biomedical knowledge, where rare and infrequent information is prevalent. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study to investigate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods for editing long-tail biomedical knowledge. Our results indicate that, while existing editing methods can enhance LLMs' performance on long-tail biomedical knowledge, their performance on long-tail knowledge remains inferior to that on high-frequency popular knowledge, even after editing. Our further analysis reveals that long-tail biomedical knowledge contains a significant amount of one-to-many knowledge, where one subject and relation link to multiple objects. This high prevalence of one-to-many knowledge limits the effectiveness of knowledge editing in improving LLMs' understanding of long-tail biomedical knowledge, highlighting the need for tailored strategies to bridge this performance gap.

# Unchecked and Overlooked: Addressing the Checkbox Blind Spot in Large Language Models with CheckboxQA 

**Authors**: Michał Turski, Mateusz Chiliński, Łukasz Borchmann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10419)  

**Abstract**: Checkboxes are critical in real-world document processing where the presence or absence of ticks directly informs data extraction and decision-making processes. Yet, despite the strong performance of Large Vision and Language Models across a wide range of tasks, they struggle with interpreting checkable content. This challenge becomes particularly pressing in industries where a single overlooked checkbox may lead to costly regulatory or contractual oversights. To address this gap, we introduce the CheckboxQA dataset, a targeted resource designed to evaluate and improve model performance on checkbox-related tasks. It reveals the limitations of current models and serves as a valuable tool for advancing document comprehension systems, with significant implications for applications in sectors such as legal tech and finance.

# CliniChat: A Multi-Source Knowledge-Driven Framework for Clinical Interview Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation 

**Authors**: Jing Chen, Zhihua Wei, Wei Zhang, Yingying Hu, Qiong Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10418)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for assisting clinical interviews due to their fluent interactive capabilities and extensive medical knowledge. However, the lack of high-quality interview dialogue data and widely accepted evaluation methods has significantly impeded this process. So we propose CliniChat, a framework that integrates multi-source knowledge to enable LLMs to simulate real-world clinical interviews. It consists of two modules: Clini-Recon and Clini-Eval, each responsible for reconstructing and evaluating interview dialogues, respectively. By incorporating three sources of knowledge, Clini-Recon transforms clinical notes into systematic, professional, and empathetic interview dialogues. Clini-Eval combines a comprehensive evaluation metric system with a two-phase automatic evaluation approach, enabling LLMs to assess interview performance like experts. We contribute MedQA-Dialog, a high-quality synthetic interview dialogue dataset, and CliniChatGLM, a model specialized for clinical interviews. Experimental results demonstrate that CliniChatGLM's interview capabilities undergo a comprehensive upgrade, particularly in history-taking, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

# LLM-SRBench: A New Benchmark for Scientific Equation Discovery with Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Parshin Shojaee, Ngoc-Hieu Nguyen, Kazem Meidani, Amir Barati Farimani, Khoa D Doan, Chandan K Reddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10415)  

**Abstract**: Scientific equation discovery is a fundamental task in the history of scientific progress, enabling the derivation of laws governing natural phenomena. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained interest for this task due to their potential to leverage embedded scientific knowledge for hypothesis generation. However, evaluating the true discovery capabilities of these methods remains challenging, as existing benchmarks often rely on common equations that are susceptible to memorization by LLMs, leading to inflated performance metrics that do not reflect discovery. In this paper, we introduce LLM-SRBench, a comprehensive benchmark with 239 challenging problems across four scientific domains specifically designed to evaluate LLM-based scientific equation discovery methods while preventing trivial memorization. Our benchmark comprises two main categories: LSR-Transform, which transforms common physical models into less common mathematical representations to test reasoning beyond memorized forms, and LSR-Synth, which introduces synthetic, discovery-driven problems requiring data-driven reasoning. Through extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art methods, using both open and closed LLMs, we find that the best-performing system so far achieves only 31.5% symbolic accuracy. These findings highlight the challenges of scientific equation discovery, positioning LLM-SRBench as a valuable resource for future research.

# Performance of Large Language Models in Supporting Medical Diagnosis and Treatment 

**Authors**: Diogo Sousa, Guilherme Barbosa, Catarina Rocha, Dulce Oliveira  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10405)  

**Abstract**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare holds significant potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support medical treatment planning. These AI-driven systems can analyze vast datasets, assisting clinicians in identifying diseases, recommending treatments, and predicting patient outcomes. This study evaluates the performance of a range of contemporary LLMs, including both open-source and closed-source models, on the 2024 Portuguese National Exam for medical specialty access (PNA), a standardized medical knowledge assessment. Our results highlight considerable variation in accuracy and cost-effectiveness, with several models demonstrating performance exceeding human benchmarks for medical students on this specific task. We identify leading models based on a combined score of accuracy and cost, discuss the implications of reasoning methodologies like Chain-of-Thought, and underscore the potential for LLMs to function as valuable complementary tools aiding medical professionals in complex clinical decision-making.

# LLM-driven Constrained Copy Generation through Iterative Refinement 

**Authors**: Varun Vasudevan, Faezeh Akhavizadegan, Abhinav Prakash, Yokila Arora, Jason Cho, Tanya Mendiratta, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10391)  

**Abstract**: Crafting a marketing message (copy), or copywriting is a challenging generation task, as the copy must adhere to various constraints. Copy creation is inherently iterative for humans, starting with an initial draft followed by successive refinements. However, manual copy creation is time-consuming and expensive, resulting in only a few copies for each use case. This limitation restricts our ability to personalize content to customers. Contrary to the manual approach, LLMs can generate copies quickly, but the generated content does not consistently meet all the constraints on the first attempt (similar to humans). While recent studies have shown promise in improving constrained generation through iterative refinement, they have primarily addressed tasks with only a few simple constraints. Consequently, the effectiveness of iterative refinement for tasks such as copy generation, which involves many intricate constraints, remains unclear. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-based end-to-end framework for scalable copy generation using iterative refinement. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address multiple challenging constraints simultaneously in copy generation. Examples of these constraints include length, topics, keywords, preferred lexical ordering, and tone of voice. We demonstrate the performance of our framework by creating copies for e-commerce banners for three different use cases of varying complexity. Our results show that iterative refinement increases the copy success rate by $16.25-35.91$% across use cases. Furthermore, the copies generated using our approach outperformed manually created content in multiple pilot studies using a multi-armed bandit framework. The winning copy improved the click-through rate by $38.5-45.21$%.

# S1-Bench: A Simple Benchmark for Evaluating System 1 Thinking Capability of Large Reasoning Models 

**Authors**: Wenyuan Zhang, Shuaiyi Nie, Xinghua Zhang, Zefeng Zhang, Tingwen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10368)  

**Abstract**: We introduce S1-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate Large Reasoning Models' (LRMs) performance on simple tasks that favor intuitive system 1 thinking rather than deliberative system 2 reasoning. While LRMs have achieved significant breakthroughs in complex reasoning tasks through explicit chains of thought, their reliance on deep analytical thinking may limit their system 1 thinking capabilities. Moreover, a lack of benchmark currently exists to evaluate LRMs' performance in tasks that require such capabilities. To fill this gap, S1-Bench presents a set of simple, diverse, and naturally clear questions across multiple domains and languages, specifically designed to assess LRMs' performance in such tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation of 22 LRMs reveals significant lower efficiency tendencies, with outputs averaging 15.5 times longer than those of traditional small LLMs. Additionally, LRMs often identify correct answers early but continue unnecessary deliberation, with some models even producing numerous errors. These findings highlight the rigid reasoning patterns of current LRMs and underscore the substantial development needed to achieve balanced dual-system thinking capabilities that can adapt appropriately to task complexity.

# DICE: A Framework for Dimensional and Contextual Evaluation of Language Models 

**Authors**: Aryan Shrivastava, Paula Akemi Aoyagui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10359)  

**Abstract**: Language models (LMs) are increasingly being integrated into a wide range of applications, yet the modern evaluation paradigm does not sufficiently reflect how they are actually being used. Current evaluations rely on benchmarks that often lack direct applicability to the real-world contexts in which LMs are being deployed. To address this gap, we propose Dimensional and Contextual Evaluation (DICE), an approach that evaluates LMs on granular, context-dependent dimensions. In this position paper, we begin by examining the insufficiency of existing LM benchmarks, highlighting their limited applicability to real-world use cases. Next, we propose a set of granular evaluation parameters that capture dimensions of LM behavior that are more meaningful to stakeholders across a variety of application domains. Specifically, we introduce the concept of context-agnostic parameters - such as robustness, coherence, and epistemic honesty - and context-specific parameters that must be tailored to the specific contextual constraints and demands of stakeholders choosing to deploy LMs into a particular setting. We then discuss potential approaches to operationalize this evaluation framework, finishing with the opportunities and challenges DICE presents to the LM evaluation landscape. Ultimately, this work serves as a practical and approachable starting point for context-specific and stakeholder-relevant evaluation of LMs.

# MultiLoKo: a multilingual local knowledge benchmark for LLMs spanning 31 languages 

**Authors**: Dieuwke Hupkes, Nikolay Bogoychev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10356)  

**Abstract**: We present MultiLoKo, a new benchmark for evaluating multilinguality in LLMs covering 31 languages. MultiLoKo consists of three partitions: a main partition consisting of 500 questions per language, separately sourced to be locally relevant to the specific language, and two translated partitions, containing human-authored translations from 30 non-English languages to English and vice versa. For comparison, we also release corresponding machine-authored translations. The data is equally distributed over two splits: a dev split and a blind, out-of-distribution test split. MultiLoKo can be used to study a variety of questions regarding the multilinguality of LLMs as well as meta-questions about multilingual benchmark creation. We compute MultiLoKo scores for 11 base and chat models marketed to be multilingual and study their average performance, their performance parity across languages, how much their ability to answer questions depends on the question language, and which languages are most difficult. None of the models we studied performs well on MultiLoKo, as indicated by low average scores as well as large differences between the best and worst scoring languages. Furthermore, we find a substantial effect of the question language, indicating sub-optimal knowledge transfer between languages. Lastly, we find that using local vs English-translated data can result in differences more than 20 points for the best performing models, drastically change the estimated difficulty of some languages. For using machines instead of human translations, we find a weaker effect on ordering of language difficulty, a larger difference in model rankings, and a substantial drop in estimated performance for all models.

# VisualPuzzles: Decoupling Multimodal Reasoning Evaluation from Domain Knowledge 

**Authors**: Yueqi Song, Tianyue Ou, Yibo Kong, Zecheng Li, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10342)  

**Abstract**: Current multimodal benchmarks often conflate reasoning with domain-specific knowledge, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate general reasoning abilities in non-expert settings. To address this, we introduce VisualPuzzles, a benchmark that targets visual reasoning while deliberately minimizing reliance on specialized knowledge. VisualPuzzles consists of diverse questions spanning five categories: algorithmic, analogical, deductive, inductive, and spatial reasoning. One major source of our questions is manually translated logical reasoning questions from the Chinese Civil Service Examination. Experiments show that VisualPuzzles requires significantly less intensive domain-specific knowledge and more complex reasoning compared to benchmarks like MMMU, enabling us to better evaluate genuine multimodal reasoning. Evaluations show that state-of-the-art multimodal large language models consistently lag behind human performance on VisualPuzzles, and that strong performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks does not necessarily translate to success on reasoning-focused, knowledge-light tasks. Additionally, reasoning enhancements such as scaling up inference compute (with "thinking" modes) yield inconsistent gains across models and task types, and we observe no clear correlation between model size and performance. We also found that models exhibit different reasoning and answering patterns on VisualPuzzles compared to benchmarks with heavier emphasis on knowledge. VisualPuzzles offers a clearer lens through which to evaluate reasoning capabilities beyond factual recall and domain knowledge.

# Forecasting from Clinical Textual Time Series: Adaptations of the Encoder and Decoder Language Model Families 

**Authors**: Shahriar Noroozizadeh, Sayantan Kumar, Jeremy C. Weiss  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10340)  

**Abstract**: Clinical case reports encode rich, temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings--extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline--serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

# MorphTok: Morphologically Grounded Tokenization for Indian Languages 

**Authors**: Maharaj Brahma, N J Karthika, Atul Singh, Devaraj Adiga, Smruti Bhate, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Rohit Saluja, Maunendra Sankar Desarkar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10335)  

**Abstract**: Tokenization is a crucial step in NLP, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs), impacting downstream performance, computational cost, and efficiency. Existing LLMs rely on the classical Byte-pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for subword tokenization that greedily merges frequent character bigrams. This often leads to segmentation that does not align with linguistically meaningful units. To address this, we propose morphology-aware segmentation as a pre-tokenization step prior to applying BPE. To facilitate morphology-aware segmentation, we create a novel dataset for Hindi and Marathi, incorporating sandhi splitting to enhance the subword tokenization. Experiments on downstream tasks show that morphologically grounded tokenization improves performance for machine translation and language modeling. Additionally, to handle the ambiguity in the Unicode characters for diacritics, particularly dependent vowels in syllable-based writing systems, we introduce Constrained BPE (CBPE), an extension to the traditional BPE algorithm that incorporates script-specific constraints. Specifically, CBPE handles dependent vowels. Our results show that CBPE achieves a 1.68\% reduction in fertility scores while maintaining comparable or improved downstream performance in machine translation, offering a computationally efficient alternative to standard BPE. Moreover, to evaluate segmentation across different tokenization algorithms, we introduce a new human evaluation metric, \textit{EvalTok}, enabling more human-grounded assessment.

# Can LLMs Generate Tabular Summaries of Science Papers? Rethinking the Evaluation Protocol 

**Authors**: Weiqi Wang, Jiefu Ou, Yangqiu Song, Benjamin Van Durme, Daniel Khashabi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10284)  

**Abstract**: Literature review tables are essential for summarizing and comparing collections of scientific papers. We explore the task of generating tables that best fulfill a user's informational needs given a collection of scientific papers. Building on recent work (Newman et al., 2024), we extend prior approaches to address real-world complexities through a combination of LLM-based methods and human annotations. Our contributions focus on three key challenges encountered in real-world use: (i) User prompts are often under-specified; (ii) Retrieved candidate papers frequently contain irrelevant content; and (iii) Task evaluation should move beyond shallow text similarity techniques and instead assess the utility of inferred tables for information-seeking tasks (e.g., comparing papers). To support reproducible evaluation, we introduce ARXIV2TABLE, a more realistic and challenging benchmark for this task, along with a novel approach to improve literature review table generation in real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments on this benchmark show that both open-weight and proprietary LLMs struggle with the task, highlighting its difficulty and the need for further advancements. Our dataset and code are available at this https URL.

# Probing then Editing Response Personality of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Tianjie Ju, Zhenyu Shao, Bowen Wang, Yujia Chen, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hao Fei, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu, Sufeng Duan, Gongshen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10227)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities to generate responses that exhibit consistent personality traits. Despite the major attempts to analyze personality expression through output-based evaluations, little is known about how such traits are internally encoded within LLM parameters. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise probing framework to systematically investigate the layer-wise capability of LLMs in encoding personality for responding. We conduct probing experiments on 11 open-source LLMs over the PersonalityEdit benchmark and find that LLMs predominantly encode personality for responding in their middle and upper layers, with instruction-tuned models demonstrating a slightly clearer separation of personality traits. Furthermore, by interpreting the trained probing hyperplane as a layer-wise boundary for each personality category, we propose a layer-wise perturbation method to edit the personality expressed by LLMs during inference. Our results show that even when the prompt explicitly specifies a particular personality, our method can still successfully alter the response personality of LLMs. Interestingly, the difficulty of converting between certain personality traits varies substantially, which aligns with the representational distances in our probing experiments. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive MMLU benchmark evaluation and time overhead analysis, demonstrating that our proposed personality editing method incurs only minimal degradation in general capabilities while maintaining low training costs and acceptable inference latency. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

# DioR: Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization for Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Hanghui Guo, Jia Zhu, Shimin Di, Weijie Shi, Zhangze Chen, Jiajie Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10198)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has shown great success in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during generation. However, existing dynamic RAG methods face significant limitations in two key aspects: 1) Lack of an effective mechanism to control retrieval triggers, and 2) Lack of effective scrutiny of retrieval content. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative dynamic RAG method, DioR (Adaptive Cognitive Detection and Contextual Retrieval Optimization), which consists of two main components: adaptive cognitive detection and contextual retrieval optimization, specifically designed to determine when retrieval is needed and what to retrieve for LLMs is useful. Experimental results demonstrate that DioR achieves superior performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our work.

# Localized Cultural Knowledge is Conserved and Controllable in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Veniamin Veselovsky, Berke Argin, Benedikt Stroebl, Chris Wendler, Robert West, James Evans, Thomas L. Griffiths, Arvind Narayanan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10191)  

**Abstract**: Just as humans display language patterns influenced by their native tongue when speaking new languages, LLMs often default to English-centric responses even when generating in other languages. Nevertheless, we observe that local cultural information persists within the models and can be readily activated for cultural customization. We first demonstrate that explicitly providing cultural context in prompts significantly improves the models' ability to generate culturally localized responses. We term the disparity in model performance with versus without explicit cultural context the explicit-implicit localization gap, indicating that while cultural knowledge exists within LLMs, it may not naturally surface in multilingual interactions if cultural context is not explicitly provided. Despite the explicit prompting benefit, however, the answers reduce in diversity and tend toward stereotypes. Second, we identify an explicit cultural customization vector, conserved across all non-English languages we explore, which enables LLMs to be steered from the synthetic English cultural world-model toward each non-English cultural world. Steered responses retain the diversity of implicit prompting and reduce stereotypes to dramatically improve the potential for customization. We discuss the implications of explicit cultural customization for understanding the conservation of alternative cultural world models within LLMs, and their controllable utility for translation, cultural customization, and the possibility of making the explicit implicit through soft control for expanded LLM function and appeal.

# Deep Reasoning Translation via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Jiaan Wang, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10187)  

**Abstract**: Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various complex tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation and taking cultural differences into account. This task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought process. Given the source sentences, the reward model teaches the deep translation model how to think and free-translate them during reinforcement learning. In this way, training DeepTrans does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning baselines as well as baselines that are fine-tuned with synthesized data. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

# LLM Unlearning Reveals a Stronger-Than-Expected Coreset Effect in Current Benchmarks 

**Authors**: Soumyadeep Pal, Changsheng Wang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10185)  

**Abstract**: Large language model unlearning has become a critical challenge in ensuring safety and controlled model behavior by removing undesired data-model influences from the pretrained model while preserving general utility. Significant recent efforts have been dedicated to developing LLM unlearning benchmarks such as WMDP (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy) and MUSE (Machine Unlearning Six-way Evaluation), facilitating standardized unlearning performance assessment and method comparison. Despite their usefulness, we uncover for the first time a novel coreset effect within these benchmarks. Specifically, we find that LLM unlearning achieved with the original (full) forget set can be effectively maintained using a significantly smaller subset (functioning as a "coreset"), e.g., as little as 5% of the forget set, even when selected at random. This suggests that LLM unlearning in these benchmarks can be performed surprisingly easily, even in an extremely low-data regime. We demonstrate that this coreset effect remains strong, regardless of the LLM unlearning method used, such as NPO (Negative Preference Optimization) and RMU (Representation Misdirection Unlearning), the popular ones in these benchmarks. The surprisingly strong coreset effect is also robust across various data selection methods, ranging from random selection to more sophisticated heuristic approaches. We explain the coreset effect in LLM unlearning through a keyword-based perspective, showing that keywords extracted from the forget set alone contribute significantly to unlearning effectiveness and indicating that current unlearning is driven by a compact set of high-impact tokens rather than the entire dataset. We further justify the faithfulness of coreset-unlearned models along additional dimensions, such as mode connectivity and robustness to jailbreaking attacks. Codes are available at this https URL.

# HalluSearch at SemEval-2025 Task 3: A Search-Enhanced RAG Pipeline for Hallucination Detection 

**Authors**: Mohamed A. Abdallah, Samhaa R. El-Beltagy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10168)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present HalluSearch, a multilingual pipeline designed to detect fabricated text spans in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. Developed as part of Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, HalluSearch couples retrieval-augmented verification with fine-grained factual splitting to identify and localize hallucinations in fourteen different languages. Empirical evaluations show that HalluSearch performs competitively, placing fourth in both English (within the top ten percent) and Czech. While the system's retrieval-based strategy generally proves robust, it faces challenges in languages with limited online coverage, underscoring the need for further research to ensure consistent hallucination detection across diverse linguistic contexts.

# C-FAITH: A Chinese Fine-Grained Benchmark for Automated Hallucination Evaluation 

**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Zhifei Liu, Jiahao Wang, Huixuan Zhang, Fan Xu, Junzhe Zhang, Xiaojun Wan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10167)  

**Abstract**: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models, they remain highly susceptible to generating hallucinations, which significantly hinders their widespread application. Hallucination research requires dynamic and fine-grained evaluation. However, most existing hallucination benchmarks (especially in Chinese language) rely on human annotations, making automatical and cost-effective hallucination evaluation challenging. To address this, we introduce HaluAgent, an agentic framework that automatically constructs fine-grained QA dataset based on some knowledge documents. Our experiments demonstrate that the manually designed rules and prompt optimization can improve the quality of generated data. Using HaluAgent, we construct C-FAITH, a Chinese QA hallucination benchmark created from 1,399 knowledge documents obtained from web scraping, totaling 60,702 entries. We comprehensively evaluate 16 mainstream LLMs with our proposed C-FAITH, providing detailed experimental results and analysis.

# MT-R1-Zero: Advancing LLM-based Machine Translation via R1-Zero-like Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Zhaopeng Feng, Shaosheng Cao, Jiahan Ren, Jiayuan Su, Ruizhe Chen, Yan Zhang, Zhe Xu, Yao Hu, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10160)  

**Abstract**: Large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) methods have proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks with verifiable solutions such as mathematics and coding. However, applying this idea to machine translation (MT), where outputs are flexibly formatted and difficult to automatically evaluate with explicit rules, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MT-R1-Zero, the first open-source adaptation of the R1-Zero RL framework for MT without supervised fine-tuning or cold-start. We propose a rule-metric mixed reward mechanism to guide LLMs towards improved translation quality via emergent reasoning. On the WMT 24 English-Chinese benchmark, our MT-R1-Zero-3B-Mix achieves competitive performance, surpassing TowerInstruct-7B-v0.2 by an average of 1.26 points. Meanwhile, our MT-R1-Zero-7B-Mix attains a high average score of 62.25 across all metrics, placing it on par with advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet, while the MT-R1-Zero-7B-Sem variant achieves state-of-the-art scores on semantic metrics. Moreover, our work exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution MT tasks, robustly supporting multilingual and low-resource settings. Extensive analysis of model behavior across different initializations and reward metrics offers pioneering insight into the critical role of reward design, LLM adaptability, training dynamics, and emergent reasoning patterns within the R1-Zero paradigm for MT.

# SocioVerse: A World Model for Social Simulation Powered by LLM Agents and A Pool of 10 Million Real-World Users 

**Authors**: Xinnong Zhang, Jiayu Lin, Xinyi Mou, Shiyue Yang, Xiawei Liu, Libo Sun, Hanjia Lyu, Yihang Yang, Weihong Qi, Yue Chen, Guanying Li, Ling Yan, Yao Hu, Siming Chen, Yu Wang, Jingxuan Huang, Jiebo Luo, Shiping Tang, Libo Wu, Baohua Zhou, Zhongyu Wei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10157)  

**Abstract**: Social simulation is transforming traditional social science research by modeling human behavior through interactions between virtual individuals and their environments. With recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this approach has shown growing potential in capturing individual differences and predicting group behaviors. However, existing methods face alignment challenges related to the environment, target users, interaction mechanisms, and behavioral patterns. To this end, we introduce SocioVerse, an LLM-agent-driven world model for social simulation. Our framework features four powerful alignment components and a user pool of 10 million real individuals. To validate its effectiveness, we conducted large-scale simulation experiments across three distinct domains: politics, news, and economics. Results demonstrate that SocioVerse can reflect large-scale population dynamics while ensuring diversity, credibility, and representativeness through standardized procedures and minimal manual adjustments.

# Towards Quantifying Commonsense Reasoning with Mechanistic Insights 

**Authors**: Abhinav Joshi, Areeb Ahmad, Divyaksh Shukla, Ashutosh Modi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10077)  

**Abstract**: Commonsense reasoning deals with the implicit knowledge that is well understood by humans and typically acquired via interactions with the world. In recent times, commonsense reasoning and understanding of various LLMs have been evaluated using text-based tasks. In this work, we argue that a proxy of this understanding can be maintained as a graphical structure that can further help to perform a rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning abilities about various real-world activities. We create an annotation scheme for capturing this implicit knowledge in the form of a graphical structure for 37 daily human activities. We find that the created resource can be used to frame an enormous number of commonsense queries (~ 10^{17}), facilitating rigorous evaluation of commonsense reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, recently, the remarkable performance of LLMs has raised questions about whether these models are truly capable of reasoning in the wild and, in general, how reasoning occurs inside these models. In this resource paper, we bridge this gap by proposing design mechanisms that facilitate research in a similar direction. Our findings suggest that the reasoning components are localized in LLMs that play a prominent role in decision-making when prompted with a commonsense query.

# A Computational Cognitive Model for Processing Repetitions of Hierarchical Relations 

**Authors**: Zeng Ren, Xinyi Guan, Martin Rohrmeier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10065)  

**Abstract**: Patterns are fundamental to human cognition, enabling the recognition of structure and regularity across diverse domains. In this work, we focus on structural repeats, patterns that arise from the repetition of hierarchical relations within sequential data, and develop a candidate computational model of how humans detect and understand such structural repeats. Based on a weighted deduction system, our model infers the minimal generative process of a given sequence in the form of a Template program, a formalism that enriches the context-free grammar with repetition combinators. Such representation efficiently encodes the repetition of sub-computations in a recursive manner. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the expressiveness of our model on short sequences from music and action planning. The proposed model offers broader insights into the mental representations and cognitive mechanisms underlying human pattern recognition.

# Hallucination Detection in LLMs via Topological Divergence on Attention Graphs 

**Authors**: Alexandra Bazarova, Aleksandr Yugay, Andrey Shulga, Alina Ermilova, Andrei Volodichev, Konstantin Polev, Julia Belikova, Rauf Parchiev, Dmitry Simakov, Maxim Savchenko, Andrey Savchenko, Serguei Barannikov, Alexey Zaytsev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10063)  

**Abstract**: Hallucination, i.e., generating factually incorrect content, remains a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). We introduce TOHA, a TOpology-based HAllucination detector in the RAG setting, which leverages a topological divergence metric to quantify the structural properties of graphs induced by attention matrices. Examining the topological divergence between prompt and response subgraphs reveals consistent patterns: higher divergence values in specific attention heads correlate with hallucinated outputs, independent of the dataset. Extensive experiments, including evaluation on question answering and data-to-text tasks, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on several benchmarks, two of which were annotated by us and are being publicly released to facilitate further research. Beyond its strong in-domain performance, TOHA maintains remarkable domain transferability across multiple open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that analyzing the topological structure of attention matrices can serve as an efficient and robust indicator of factual reliability in LLMs.

# DataMosaic: Explainable and Verifiable Multi-Modal Data Analytics through Extract-Reason-Verify 

**Authors**: Zhengxuan Zhang, Zhuowen Liang, Yin Wu, Teng Lin, Yuyu Luo, Nan Tang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10036)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming data analytics, but their widespread adoption is hindered by two critical limitations: they are not explainable (opaque reasoning processes) and not verifiable (prone to hallucinations and unchecked errors). While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding LLMs in external data, it fails to address the core challenges of trustworthy analytics - especially when processing noisy, inconsistent, or multi-modal data (for example, text, tables, images). We propose DataMosaic, a framework designed to make LLM-powered analytics both explainable and verifiable. By dynamically extracting task-specific structures (for example, tables, graphs, trees) from raw data, DataMosaic provides transparent, step-by-step reasoning traces and enables validation of intermediate results. Built on a multi-agent framework, DataMosaic orchestrates self-adaptive agents that align with downstream task requirements, enhancing consistency, completeness, and privacy. Through this approach, DataMosaic not only tackles the limitations of current LLM-powered analytics systems but also lays the groundwork for a new paradigm of grounded, accurate, and explainable multi-modal data analytics.

# The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Address Multimodal Hallucination 

**Authors**: Hao Yin, Gunagzong Si, Zilei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10020)  

**Abstract**: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

# Turn-taking annotation for quantitative and qualitative analyses of conversation 

**Authors**: Anneliese Kelterer, Barbara Schuppler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09980)  

**Abstract**: This paper has two goals. First, we present the turn-taking annotation layers created for 95 minutes of conversational speech of the Graz Corpus of Read and Spontaneous Speech (GRASS), available to the scientific community. Second, we describe the annotation system and the annotation process in more detail, so other researchers may use it for their own conversational data. The annotation system was developed with an interdisciplinary application in mind. It should be based on sequential criteria according to Conversation Analysis, suitable for subsequent phonetic analysis, thus time-aligned annotations were made Praat, and it should be suitable for automatic classification, which required the continuous annotation of speech and a label inventory that is not too large and results in a high inter-rater agreement. Turn-taking was annotated on two layers, Inter-Pausal Units (IPU) and points of potential completion (PCOMP; similar to transition relevance places). We provide a detailed description of the annotation process and of segmentation and labelling criteria. A detailed analysis of inter-rater agreement and common confusions shows that agreement for IPU annotation is near-perfect, that agreement for PCOMP annotations is substantial, and that disagreements often are either partial or can be explained by a different analysis of a sequence which also has merit. The annotation system can be applied to a variety of conversational data for linguistic studies and technological applications, and we hope that the annotations, as well as the annotation system will contribute to a stronger cross-fertilization between these disciplines.

# C-MTCSD: A Chinese Multi-Turn Conversational Stance Detection Dataset 

**Authors**: Fuqiang Niu, Yi Yang, Xianghua Fu, Genan Dai, Bowen Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09958)  

**Abstract**: Stance detection has become an essential tool for analyzing public discussions on social media. Current methods face significant challenges, particularly in Chinese language processing and multi-turn conversational analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce C-MTCSD, the largest Chinese multi-turn conversational stance detection dataset, comprising 24,264 carefully annotated instances from Sina Weibo, which is 4.2 times larger than the only prior Chinese conversational stance detection dataset. Our comprehensive evaluation using both traditional approaches and large language models reveals the complexity of C-MTCSD: even state-of-the-art models achieve only 64.07% F1 score in the challenging zero-shot setting, while performance consistently degrades with increasing conversation depth. Traditional models particularly struggle with implicit stance detection, achieving below 50% F1 score. This work establishes a challenging new benchmark for Chinese stance detection research, highlighting significant opportunities for future improvements.

# Guiding Reasoning in Small Language Models with LLM Assistance 

**Authors**: Yujin Kim, Euiin Yi, Minu Kim, Se-Young Yun, Taehyeon Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09923)  

**Abstract**: The limited reasoning capabilities of small language models (SLMs) cast doubt on their suitability for tasks demanding deep, multi-step logical deduction. This paper introduces a framework called Small Reasons, Large Hints (SMART), which selectively augments SLM reasoning with targeted guidance from large language models (LLMs). Inspired by the concept of cognitive scaffolding, SMART employs a score-based evaluation to identify uncertain reasoning steps and injects corrective LLM-generated reasoning only when necessary. By framing structured reasoning as an optimal policy search, our approach steers the reasoning trajectory toward correct solutions without exhaustive sampling. Our experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that targeted external scaffolding significantly improves performance, paving the way for collaborative use of both SLM and LLM to tackle complex reasoning tasks that are currently unsolvable by SLMs alone.

# Learning to Erase Private Knowledge from Multi-Documents for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yujing Wang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Yongxin Tong, Binghui Guo, Hongwei Zheng, Zhiming Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09910)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising technique for applying LLMs to proprietary domains. However, retrieved documents may contain sensitive knowledge, posing risks of privacy leakage in generative results. Thus, effectively erasing private information from retrieved documents is a key challenge for RAG. Unlike traditional text anonymization, RAG should consider: (1) the inherent multi-document reasoning may face de-anonymization attacks; (2) private knowledge varies by scenarios, so users should be allowed to customize which information to erase; (3) preserving sufficient publicly available knowledge for generation tasks. This paper introduces the privacy erasure task for RAG and proposes Eraser4RAG, a private knowledge eraser which effectively removes user-defined private knowledge from documents while preserving sufficient public knowledge for generation. Specifically, we first construct a global knowledge graph to identify potential knowledge across documents, aiming to defend against de-anonymization attacks. Then we randomly split it into private and public sub-graphs, and fine-tune Flan-T5 to rewrite the retrieved documents excluding private triples. Finally, PPO algorithm optimizes the rewriting model to minimize private triples and maximize public triples retention. Experiments on four QA datasets demonstrate that Eraser4RAG achieves superior erase performance than GPT-4o.

# Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Comprehensive Review of Models, Methods, and Applications 

**Authors**: Farha Nausheen, Khandakar Ahmed, M Imad Khan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09909)  

**Abstract**: In recent developments, deep learning methodologies applied to Natural Language Processing (NLP) have revealed a paradox: They improve performance but demand considerable data and resources for their training. Alternatively, quantum computing exploits the principles of quantum mechanics to overcome the computational limitations of current methodologies, thereby establishing an emerging field known as quantum natural language processing (QNLP). This domain holds the potential to attain a quantum advantage in the processing of linguistic structures, surpassing classical models in both efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, it is proposed to categorise QNLP models based on quantum computing principles, architecture, and computational approaches. This paper attempts to provide a survey on how quantum meets language by mapping state-of-the-art in this area, embracing quantum encoding techniques for classical data, QNLP models for prevalent NLP tasks, and quantum optimisation techniques for hyper parameter tuning. The landscape of quantum computing approaches applied to various NLP tasks is summarised by showcasing the specific QNLP methods used, and the popularity of these methods is indicated by their count. From the findings, it is observed that QNLP approaches are still limited to small data sets, with only a few models explored extensively, and there is increasing interest in the application of quantum computing to natural language processing tasks.

# Refining Financial Consumer Complaints through Multi-Scale Model Interaction 

**Authors**: Bo-Wei Chen, An-Zi Yen, Chung-Chi Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09903)  

**Abstract**: Legal writing demands clarity, formality, and domain-specific precision-qualities often lacking in documents authored by individuals without legal training. To bridge this gap, this paper explores the task of legal text refinement that transforms informal, conversational inputs into persuasive legal arguments. We introduce FinDR, a Chinese dataset of financial dispute records, annotated with official judgments on claim reasonableness. Our proposed method, Multi-Scale Model Interaction (MSMI), leverages a lightweight classifier to evaluate outputs and guide iterative refinement by Large Language Models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MSMI significantly outperforms single-pass prompting strategies. Additionally, we validate the generalizability of MSMI on several short-text benchmarks, showing improved adversarial robustness. Our findings reveal the potential of multi-model collaboration for enhancing legal document generation and broader text refinement tasks.

# TWSSenti: A Novel Hybrid Framework for Topic-Wise Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Using Transformer Models 

**Authors**: Aish Albladi, Md Kaosar Uddin, Minarul Islam, Cheryl Seals  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09896)  

**Abstract**: Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP) that enables the extraction of meaningful insights from textual data, particularly from dynamic platforms like Twitter and IMDB. This study explores a hybrid framework combining transformer-based models, specifically BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT, to improve sentiment classification accuracy and robustness. The framework addresses challenges such as noisy data, contextual ambiguity, and generalization across diverse datasets by leveraging the unique strengths of these models. BERT captures bidirectional context, GPT-2 enhances generative capabilities, RoBERTa optimizes contextual understanding with larger corpora and dynamic masking, XLNet models dependency through permutation-based learning, and DistilBERT offers efficiency with reduced computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. We demonstrate text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Bag of Words (BoW), ensure high-quality input data for the models. The hybrid approach was evaluated on benchmark datasets Sentiment140 and IMDB, achieving superior accuracy rates of 94\% and 95\%, respectively, outperforming standalone models. The results validate the effectiveness of combining multiple transformer models in ensemble-like setups to address the limitations of individual architectures. This research highlights its applicability to real-world tasks such as social media monitoring, customer sentiment analysis, and public opinion tracking which offers a pathway for future advancements in hybrid NLP frameworks.

# Learning from Reference Answers: Versatile Language Model Alignment without Binary Human Preference Data 

**Authors**: Shuai Zhao, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09895)  

**Abstract**: Large language models~(LLMs) are expected to be helpful, harmless, and honest. In various alignment scenarios, such as general human preference, safety, and confidence alignment, binary preference data collection and reward modeling are resource-intensive but necessary for human preference transferring. In this work, we explore using the similarity between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as an alternative reward function for LLM alignment. Using similarity as a reward circumvents training reward models, and collecting a single reference answer potentially costs less time than constructing binary preference pairs when multiple candidates are available. Specifically, we develop \textit{RefAlign}, a versatile REINFORCE-style alignment algorithm, which is free of reference and reward models. Instead, RefAlign utilizes BERTScore between sampled generations and high-quality reference answers as the surrogate reward. Beyond general human preference optimization, RefAlign can be readily extended to diverse scenarios, such as safety and confidence alignment, by incorporating the similarity reward with task-related objectives. In various scenarios, {RefAlign} demonstrates comparable performance to previous alignment methods while offering high efficiency.

# Investigating Syntactic Biases in Multilingual Transformers with RC Attachment Ambiguities in Italian and English 

**Authors**: Michael Kamerath, Aniello De Santo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09886)  

**Abstract**: This paper leverages past sentence processing studies to investigate whether monolingual and multilingual LLMs show human-like preferences when presented with examples of relative clause attachment ambiguities in Italian and English. Furthermore, we test whether these preferences can be modulated by lexical factors (the type of verb/noun in the matrix clause) which have been shown to be tied to subtle constraints on syntactic and semantic relations. Our results overall showcase how LLM behavior varies interestingly across models, but also general failings of these models in correctly capturing human-like preferences. In light of these results, we argue that RC attachment is the ideal benchmark for cross-linguistic investigations of LLMs' linguistic knowledge and biases.

# PASS-FC: Progressive and Adaptive Search Scheme for Fact Checking of Comprehensive Claims 

**Authors**: Ziyu Zhuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09866)  

**Abstract**: Automated fact-checking faces challenges in handling complex real-world claims. We present PASS-FC, a novel framework that addresses these issues through claim augmentation, adaptive question generation, and iterative verification. PASS-FC enhances atomic claims with temporal and entity context, employs advanced search techniques, and utilizes a reflection mechanism. We evaluate PASS-FC on six diverse datasets, demonstrating superior performance across general knowledge, scientific, real-world, and multilingual fact-checking tasks. Our framework often surpasses stronger baseline models. Hyperparameter analysis reveals optimal settings for evidence quantity and reflection label triggers, while ablation studies highlight the importance of claim augmentation and language-specific adaptations. PASS-FC's performance underscores its effectiveness in improving fact-checking accuracy and adaptability across various domains. We will open-source our code and experimental results to facilitate further research in this area.

# Abacus-SQL: A Text-to-SQL System Empowering Cross-Domain and Open-Domain Database Retrieval 

**Authors**: Keyan Xu, Dingzirui Wang, Xuanliang Zhang, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09824)  

**Abstract**: The existing text-to-SQL systems have made significant progress in SQL query generation, but they still face numerous challenges. Existing systems often lack retrieval capabilities for open-domain databases, requiring users to manually filter relevant databases. Additionally, their cross-domain transferability is limited, making it challenging to accommodate diverse query requirements. To address these issues, we propose Abacus-SQL. Abacus-SQL utilizes database retrieval technology to accurately locate the required databases in an open-domain database environment. It also enhances the system cross-domain transfer ability through data augmentation methods. Moreover, Abacus-SQL employs Pre-SQL and Self-debug methods, thereby enhancing the accuracy of SQL queries. Experimental results demonstrate that Abacus-SQL performs excellently in multi-turn text-to-SQL tasks, effectively validating the approach's effectiveness. Abacus-SQL is publicly accessible at this https URL.

# Transferable text data distillation by trajectory matching 

**Authors**: Rong Yao, Hailin Hu, Yifei Fu, Hanting Chen, Wenyi Fang, Fanyi Du, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09818)  

**Abstract**: In the realm of large language model (LLM), as the size of large models increases, it also brings higher training costs. There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).

# Training Small Reasoning LLMs with Cognitive Preference Alignment 

**Authors**: Wenrui Cai, Chengyu Wang, Junbing Yan, Jun Huang, Xiangzhong Fang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09802)  

**Abstract**: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have seen substantial advancements through deep thinking. However, these enhancements come with significant resource demands, underscoring the need to explore strategies to train effective reasoning LLMs with far fewer parameters. A critical challenge is that smaller models have different capacities and cognitive trajectories than their larger counterparts. Hence, direct distillation of chain-of-thought (CoT) results from large LLMs to smaller ones can be sometimes ineffective and requires a huge amount of annotated data. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Critique-Rethink-Verify (CRV), designed for training smaller yet powerful reasoning LLMs. Our CRV framework consists of multiple LLM agents, each specializing in unique abilities: (i) critiquing the CoTs according to the cognitive capabilities of smaller models, (ii) rethinking and refining these CoTs based on the critiques, and (iii) verifying the correctness of the refined results. We further propose the cognitive preference optimization (CogPO) algorithm to enhance the reasoning abilities of smaller models by aligning thoughts of these models with their cognitive capacities. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of CRV and CogPO, which outperforms other training methods by a large margin.

# VDocRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Visually-Rich Documents 

**Authors**: Ryota Tanaka, Taichi Iki, Taku Hasegawa, Kyosuke Nishida, Kuniko Saito, Jun Suzuki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09795)  

**Abstract**: We aim to develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that answers questions over a corpus of visually-rich documents presented in mixed modalities (e.g., charts, tables) and diverse formats (e.g., PDF, PPTX). In this paper, we introduce a new RAG framework, VDocRAG, which can directly understand varied documents and modalities in a unified image format to prevent missing information that occurs by parsing documents to obtain text. To improve the performance, we propose novel self-supervised pre-training tasks that adapt large vision-language models for retrieval by compressing visual information into dense token representations while aligning them with textual content in documents. Furthermore, we introduce OpenDocVQA, the first unified collection of open-domain document visual question answering datasets, encompassing diverse document types and formats. OpenDocVQA provides a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating retrieval and question answering models on visually-rich documents in an open-domain setting. Experiments show that VDocRAG substantially outperforms conventional text-based RAG and has strong generalization capability, highlighting the potential of an effective RAG paradigm for real-world documents.

# Reasoning Court: Combining Reasoning, Action, and Judgment for Multi-Hop Reasoning 

**Authors**: Jingtian Wu, Claire Cardie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09781)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in tasks like question answering and fact verification, they continue to suffer from hallucinations and reasoning errors, especially in multi-hop tasks that require integration of multiple information sources. Current methods address these issues through retrieval-based techniques (grounding reasoning in external evidence), reasoning-based approaches (enhancing coherence via improved prompting), or hybrid strategies combining both elements. One prominent hybrid method, ReAct, has outperformed purely retrieval-based or reasoning-based approaches; however, it lacks internal verification of intermediate reasoning steps, allowing potential errors to propagate through complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning Court (RC), a novel framework that extends iterative reasoning-and-retrieval methods, such as ReAct, with a dedicated LLM judge. Unlike ReAct, RC employs this judge to independently evaluate multiple candidate answers and their associated reasoning generated by separate LLM agents. The judge is asked to select the answer that it considers the most factually grounded and logically coherent based on the presented reasoning and evidence, or synthesizes a new answer using available evidence and its pre-trained knowledge if all candidates are inadequate, flawed, or invalid. Evaluations on multi-hop benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue) and fact-verification (FEVER) demonstrate that RC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot prompting methods without task-specific fine-tuning.

# Executable Functional Abstractions: Inferring Generative Programs for Advanced Math Problems 

**Authors**: Zaid Khan, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09763)  

**Abstract**: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.

# Improving Multilingual Capabilities with Cultural and Local Knowledge in Large Language Models While Enhancing Native Performance 

**Authors**: Ram Mohan Rao Kadiyala, Siddartha Pullakhandam, Siddhant Gupta, Drishti Sharma, Jebish Purbey, Kanwal Mehreen, Muhammad Arham, Hamza Farooq  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09753)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but their development has primarily focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving many languages underserved. We present our latest Hindi-English bi-lingual LLM \textbf{Mantra-14B} with ~3\% average improvement in benchmark scores over both languages, outperforming models twice its size. Using a curated dataset composed of English and Hindi instruction data of 485K samples, we instruction tuned models such as Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct and Phi-4 to improve performance over both English and Hindi. Our experiments encompassing seven different LLMs of varying parameter sizes and over 140 training attempts with varying English-Hindi training data ratios demonstrated that it is possible to significantly improve multilingual performance without compromising native performance. Further, our approach avoids resource-intensive techniques like vocabulary expansion or architectural modifications, thus keeping the model size small. Our results indicate that modest fine-tuning with culturally and locally informed data can bridge performance gaps without incurring significant computational overhead. We release our training code, datasets, and models under mit and apache licenses to aid further research towards under-represented and low-resource languages.

# Evaluating the Quality of Benchmark Datasets for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Turkish 

**Authors**: Ayşe Aysu Cengiz, Ahmet Kaan Sever, Elif Ecem Ümütlü, Naime Şeyma Erdem, Burak Aytan, Büşra Tufan, Abdullah Topraksoy, Esra Darıcı, Cagri Toraman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09714)  

**Abstract**: The reliance on translated or adapted datasets from English or multilingual resources introduces challenges regarding linguistic and cultural suitability. This study addresses the need for robust and culturally appropriate benchmarks by evaluating the quality of 17 commonly used Turkish benchmark datasets. Using a comprehensive framework that assesses six criteria, both human and LLM-judge annotators provide detailed evaluations to identify dataset strengths and shortcomings.
Our results reveal that 70% of the benchmark datasets fail to meet our heuristic quality standards. The correctness of the usage of technical terms is the strongest criterion, but 85% of the criteria are not satisfied in the examined datasets. Although LLM judges demonstrate potential, they are less effective than human annotators, particularly in understanding cultural common sense knowledge and interpreting fluent, unambiguous text. GPT-4o has stronger labeling capabilities for grammatical and technical tasks, while Llama3.3-70B excels at correctness and cultural knowledge evaluation. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for more rigorous quality control in creating and adapting datasets for low-resource languages.

# GRPO-LEAD: A Difficulty-Aware Reinforcement Learning Approach for Concise Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models 

**Authors**: Jixiao Zhang, Chunsheng Zuo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09696)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in R1-like reasoning models leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly improved the performance of language models on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, current GRPO implementations encounter critical challenges, including reward sparsity due to binary accuracy metrics, limited incentives for conciseness, and insufficient focus on complex reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose GRPO-LEAD, a suite of novel enhancements tailored for mathematical reasoning. Specifically, GRPO-LEAD introduces (1) a length-dependent accuracy reward to encourage concise and precise solutions, (2) an explicit penalty mechanism for incorrect answers to sharpen decision boundaries, and (3) a difficulty-aware advantage reweighting strategy that amplifies learning signals for challenging problems. Furthermore, we systematically examine the impact of model scale and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategies, demonstrating that larger-scale base models and carefully curated datasets significantly enhance reinforcement learning effectiveness. Extensive empirical evaluations and ablation studies confirm that GRPO-LEAD substantially mitigates previous shortcomings, resulting in language models that produce more concise, accurate, and robust reasoning across diverse mathematical tasks.

# Domain-Adaptive Continued Pre-Training of Small Language Models 

**Authors**: Salman Faroz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09687)  

**Abstract**: Continued pre-training of small language models offers a promising path for domain adaptation with limited computational resources. I've investigated this approach within educational domains, evaluating it as a resource-efficient alternative to training models from scratch. Using a 125M parameter model, I demonstrate significant performance improvements through incremental training on 400 million tokens, followed by further training to reach 1 billion tokens. My approach includes comprehensive data preprocessing, memory-optimized training configurations, and benchmark-based evaluation. Results show notable gains in knowledge-intensive tasks (MMLU +8.1%) and contextual understanding (HellaSwag +7.6%), while revealing educational domain specialization trade-offs. I analyze token efficiency, catastrophic forgetting mitigation strategies, and scaling patterns. My findings suggest that thoughtful preprocessing and training methodologies enable meaningful improvements in language model capabilities even with constrained computational resources, opening pathways for domain-specific adaptation of smaller language models.

# CLEAR-KGQA: Clarification-Enhanced Ambiguity Resolution for Knowledge Graph Question Answering 

**Authors**: Liqiang Wen, Guanming Xiong, Tong Mo, Bing Li, Weiping Li, Wen Zhao

**Abstract**: This study addresses the challenge of ambiguity in knowledge graph question answering (KGQA). While recent KGQA systems have made significant progress, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs), they typically assume user queries are unambiguous, which is an assumption that rarely holds in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that dynamically handles both entity ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between entities with similar names) and intent ambiguity (e.g., clarifying different interpretations of user queries) through interactive clarification. Our approach employs a Bayesian inference mechanism to quantify query ambiguity and guide LLMs in determining when and how to request clarification from users within a multi-turn dialogue framework. We further develop a two-agent interaction framework where an LLM-based user simulator enables iterative refinement of logical forms through simulated user feedback. Experimental results on the WebQSP and CWQ dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves performance by effectively resolving semantic ambiguities. Additionally, we contribute a refined dataset of disambiguated queries, derived from interaction histories, to facilitate future research in this direction.

# Myanmar XNLI: Building a Dataset and Exploring Low-resource Approaches to Natural Language Inference with Myanmar 

**Authors**: Aung Kyaw Htet, Mark Dras  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09645)  

**Abstract**: Despite dramatic recent progress in NLP, it is still a major challenge to apply Large Language Models (LLM) to low-resource languages. This is made visible in benchmarks such as Cross-Lingual Natural Language Inference (XNLI), a key task that demonstrates cross-lingual capabilities of NLP systems across a set of 15 languages. In this paper, we extend the XNLI task for one additional low-resource language, Myanmar, as a proxy challenge for broader low-resource languages, and make three core contributions. First, we build a dataset called Myanmar XNLI (myXNLI) using community crowd-sourced methods, as an extension to the existing XNLI corpus. This involves a two-stage process of community-based construction followed by expert verification; through an analysis, we demonstrate and quantify the value of the expert verification stage in the context of community-based construction for low-resource languages. We make the myXNLI dataset available to the community for future research. Second, we carry out evaluations of recent multilingual language models on the myXNLI benchmark, as well as explore data-augmentation methods to improve model performance. Our data-augmentation methods improve model accuracy by up to 2 percentage points for Myanmar, while uplifting other languages at the same time. Third, we investigate how well these data-augmentation methods generalise to other low-resource languages in the XNLI dataset.

# Iterative Self-Training for Code Generation via Reinforced Re-Ranking 

**Authors**: Nikita Sorokin, Ivan Sedykh, Valentin Malykh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09643)  

**Abstract**: Generating high-quality code that solves complex programming tasks is challenging, especially with current decoder-based models that produce highly stochastic outputs. In code generation, even minor errors can easily break the entire solution. Leveraging multiple sampled solutions can significantly improve the overall output quality.
One effective way to enhance code generation is by pairing a code generation model with a reranker model, which selects the best solution from the generated samples. We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance.
Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language.

# Leveraging Reasoning Model Answers to Enhance Non-Reasoning Model Capability 

**Authors**: Haotian Wang, Han Zhao, Shuaiting Chen, Xiaoyu Tian, Sitong Zhao, Yunjie Ji, Yiping Peng, Xiangang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09639)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1, have demonstrated the significant effectiveness of test-time scaling, achieving substantial performance gains across various benchmarks. These advanced models utilize deliberate "thinking" steps to systematically enhance answer quality. In this paper, we propose leveraging these high-quality outputs generated by reasoning-intensive models to improve less computationally demanding, non-reasoning models. We explore and compare methodologies for utilizing the answers produced by reasoning models to train and improve non-reasoning models. Through straightforward Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) experiments on established benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements across various benchmarks, underscoring the potential of this approach for advancing the ability of models to answer questions directly.

# Metropolis-Hastings Captioning Game: Knowledge Fusion of Vision Language Models via Decentralized Bayesian Inference 

**Authors**: Yuta Matsui, Ryosuke Yamaki, Ryo Ueda, Seitaro Shinagawa, Tadahiro Taniguchi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09620)  

**Abstract**: We propose the Metropolis-Hastings Captioning Game (MHCG), a method to fuse knowledge of multiple vision-language models (VLMs) by learning from each other. Although existing methods that combine multiple models suffer from inference costs and architectural constraints, MHCG avoids these problems by performing decentralized Bayesian inference through a process resembling a language game. The knowledge fusion process establishes communication between two VLM agents alternately captioning images and learning from each other. We conduct two image-captioning experiments with two VLMs, each pre-trained on a different dataset. The first experiment demonstrates that MHCG achieves consistent improvement in reference-free evaluation metrics. The second experiment investigates how MHCG contributes to sharing VLMs' category-level vocabulary by observing the occurrence of the vocabulary in the generated captions.

# Short-Path Prompting in LLMs: Analyzing Reasoning Instability and Solutions for Robust Performance 

**Authors**: Zuoli Tang, Junjie Ou, Kaiqin Hu, Chunwei Wu, Zhaoxin Huan, Chilin Fu, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou, Chenliang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09586)  

**Abstract**: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in large language models' (LLMs) reasoning, which is largely due to the chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, allowing models to generate intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. Building on these advances, state-of-the-art LLMs are instruction-tuned to provide long and detailed CoT pathways when responding to reasoning-related questions. However, human beings are naturally cognitive misers and will prompt language models to give rather short responses, thus raising a significant conflict with CoT reasoning. In this paper, we delve into how LLMs' reasoning performance changes when users provide short-path prompts. The results and analysis reveal that language models can reason effectively and robustly without explicit CoT prompts, while under short-path prompting, LLMs' reasoning ability drops significantly and becomes unstable, even on grade-school problems. To address this issue, we propose two approaches: an instruction-guided approach and a fine-tuning approach, both designed to effectively manage the conflict. Experimental results show that both methods achieve high accuracy, providing insights into the trade-off between instruction adherence and reasoning accuracy in current models.

# LLMs Can Achieve High-quality Simultaneous Machine Translation as Efficiently as Offline 

**Authors**: Biao Fu, Minpeng Liao, Kai Fan, Chengxi Li, Liang Zhang, Yidong Chen, Xiaodong Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09570)  

**Abstract**: When the complete source sentence is provided, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform excellently in offline machine translation even with a simple prompt "Translate the following sentence from [src lang] into [tgt lang]:". However, in many real scenarios, the source tokens arrive in a streaming manner and simultaneous machine translation (SiMT) is required, then the efficiency and performance of decoder-only LLMs are significantly limited by their auto-regressive nature. To enable LLMs to achieve high-quality SiMT as efficiently as offline translation, we propose a novel paradigm that includes constructing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for SiMT, along with new training and inference strategies. To replicate the token input/output stream in SiMT, the source and target tokens are rearranged into an interleaved sequence, separated by special tokens according to varying latency requirements. This enables powerful LLMs to learn read and write operations adaptively, based on varying latency prompts, while still maintaining efficient auto-regressive decoding. Experimental results show that, even with limited SFT data, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SiMT benchmarks, and preserves the original abilities of offline translation. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to document-level SiMT setting without requiring specific fine-tuning, even beyond the offline translation model.

# Syzygy of Thoughts: Improving LLM CoT with the Minimal Free Resolution 

**Authors**: Chenghao Li, Chaoning Zhang, Yi Lu, Jiaquan Zhang, Qigan Sun, Xudong Wang, Jiwei Wei, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Heng Tao Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09566)  

**Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by decomposing problems into sequential steps, mimicking human logic and reducing errors. However, complex tasks with vast solution spaces and vague constraints often exceed the capacity of a single reasoning chain. Inspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, we propose Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT)-a novel framework that extends CoT by introducing auxiliary, interrelated reasoning paths. SoT captures deeper logical dependencies, enabling more robust and structured problem-solving. MFR decomposes a module into a sequence of free modules with minimal rank, providing a structured analytical approach to complex systems. This method introduces the concepts of "Module", "Betti numbers","Freeness", "Mapping", "Exactness" and "Minimality", enabling the systematic decomposition of the original complex problem into logically complete minimal subproblems while preserving key problem features and reducing reasoning length. We tested SoT across diverse datasets (e.g., GSM8K, MATH) and models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Qwen2.5), achieving inference accuracy that matches or surpasses mainstream CoTs standards. Additionally, by aligning the sampling process with algebraic constraints, our approach enhances the scalability of inference time in LLMs, ensuring both transparent reasoning and high performance. Our code will be publicly available at this https URL.

# How new data permeates LLM knowledge and how to dilute it 

**Authors**: Chen Sun, Renat Aksitov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Andrew Miller, Max Vladymyrov, Ulrich Rueckert, Been Kim, Mark Sandler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09522)  

**Abstract**: Large language models learn and continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a "priming" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce "Outlandish," a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before learning. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95\% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models. Further materials: this https URL

# MADLLM: Multivariate Anomaly Detection via Pre-trained LLMs 

**Authors**: Wei Tao, Xiaoyang Qu, Kai Lu, Jiguang Wan, Guokuan Li, Jianzong Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09504)  

**Abstract**: When applying pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to address anomaly detection tasks, the multivariate time series (MTS) modality of anomaly detection does not align with the text modality of LLMs. Existing methods simply transform the MTS data into multiple univariate time series sequences, which can cause many problems. This paper introduces MADLLM, a novel multivariate anomaly detection method via pre-trained LLMs. We design a new triple encoding technique to align the MTS modality with the text modality of LLMs. Specifically, this technique integrates the traditional patch embedding method with two novel embedding approaches: Skip Embedding, which alters the order of patch processing in traditional methods to help LLMs retain knowledge of previous features, and Feature Embedding, which leverages contrastive learning to allow the model to better understand the correlations between different features. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various public anomaly detection datasets.

# Kongzi: A Historical Large Language Model with Fact Enhancement 

**Authors**: Jiashu Yang, Ningning Wang, Yian Zhao, Chaoran Feng, Junjia Du, Hao Pang, Zhirui Fang, Xuxin Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09488)  

**Abstract**: The capabilities of the latest large language models (LLMs) have been extended from pure natural language understanding to complex reasoning tasks. However, current reasoning models often exhibit factual inaccuracies in longer reasoning chains, which poses challenges for historical reasoning and limits the potential of LLMs in complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. Historical studies require not only the accurate presentation of factual information but also the ability to establish cross-temporal correlations and derive coherent conclusions from fragmentary and often ambiguous sources. To address these challenges, we propose Kongzi, a large language model specifically designed for historical analysis. Through the integration of curated, high-quality historical data and a novel fact-reinforcement learning strategy, Kongzi demonstrates strong factual alignment and sophisticated reasoning depth. Extensive experiments on tasks such as historical question answering and narrative generation demonstrate that Kongzi outperforms existing models in both factual accuracy and reasoning depth. By effectively addressing the unique challenges inherent in historical texts, Kongzi sets a new standard for the development of accurate and reliable LLMs in professional domains.

# HalluShift: Measuring Distribution Shifts towards Hallucination Detection in LLMs 

**Authors**: Sharanya Dasgupta, Sujoy Nath, Arkaprabha Basu, Pourya Shamsolmoali, Swagatam Das  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09482)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered widespread attention due to their adeptness at generating innovative responses to the given prompts across a multitude of domains. However, LLMs often suffer from the inherent limitation of hallucinations and generate incorrect information while maintaining well-structured and coherent responses. In this work, we hypothesize that hallucinations stem from the internal dynamics of LLMs. Our observations indicate that, during passage generation, LLMs tend to deviate from factual accuracy in subtle parts of responses, eventually shifting toward misinformation. This phenomenon bears a resemblance to human cognition, where individuals may hallucinate while maintaining logical coherence, embedding uncertainty within minor segments of their speech. To investigate this further, we introduce an innovative approach, HalluShift, designed to analyze the distribution shifts in the internal state space and token probabilities of the LLM-generated responses. Our method attains superior performance compared to existing baselines across various benchmark datasets. Our codebase is available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Wuyang Lan, Wenzheng Wang, Changwei Ji, Guoxing Yang, Yongbo Zhang, Xiaohong Liu, Song Wu, Guangyu Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09421)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs)has shown remarkable reasoning capabilities in domains such as mathematics and coding, yet their application to clinical diagnosis remains underexplored. Here, we introduce ClinicalGPT-R1, a reasoning enhanced generalist large language model for disease diagnosis. Trained on a dataset of 20,000 real-world clinical records, ClinicalGPT-R1 leverages diverse training strategies to enhance diagnostic reasoning. To benchmark performance, we curated MedBench-Hard, a challenging dataset spanning seven major medical specialties and representative diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that ClinicalGPT-R1 outperforms GPT-4o in Chinese diagnostic tasks and achieves comparable performance to GPT-4 in English settings. This comparative study effectively validates the superior performance of ClinicalGPT-R1 in disease diagnosis tasks. Resources are available at this https URL.

# SaRO: Enhancing LLM Safety through Reasoning-based Alignment 

**Authors**: Yutao Mou, Yuxiao Luo, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09420)  

**Abstract**: Current safety alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs) face two key challenges: (1) under-generalization, which leaves models vulnerable to novel jailbreak attacks, and (2) over-alignment, which leads to the excessive refusal of benign instructions. Our preliminary investigation reveals semantic overlap between jailbreak/harmful queries and normal prompts in embedding space, suggesting that more effective safety alignment requires a deeper semantic understanding. This motivates us to incorporate safety-policy-driven reasoning into the alignment process. To this end, we propose the Safety-oriented Reasoning Optimization Framework (SaRO), which consists of two stages: (1) Reasoning-style Warmup (RW) that enables LLMs to internalize long-chain reasoning through supervised fine-tuning, and (2) Safety-oriented Reasoning Process Optimization (SRPO) that promotes safety reflection via direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SaRO over traditional alignment methods.

**Authors**: Yuxuan Lu, Bingsheng Yao, Hansu Gu, Jing Huang, Jessie Wang, Yang Li, Jiri Gesi, Qi He, Toby Jia-Jun Li, Dakuo Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09407)  

**Abstract**: Usability testing is a fundamental research method that user experience (UX) researchers use to evaluate and iterate a web design, but\textbf{ how to evaluate and iterate the usability testing study design } itself? Recent advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (\textbf{LLM Agent}) research inspired us to design \textbf{UXAgent} to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically generate thousands of simulated users to interactively test the target website. The system also provides an Agent Interview Interface and a Video Replay Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the generated qualitative and quantitative log data. Through a heuristic evaluation, five UX researcher participants praised the innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX studies.

# Question Tokens Deserve More Attention: Enhancing Large Language Models without Training through Step-by-Step Reading and Question Attention Recalibration 

**Authors**: Feijiang Han, Licheng Guo, Hengtao Cui, Zhiyuan Lyu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09402)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks that require a deep understanding of complex questions, especially when faced with long-range dependencies or multi-step reasoning. This work investigates the limitations of current LLMs in question comprehension and identifies three insights: (1) repeating question tokens improves comprehension by increasing attention to question regions, (2) increased backward dependencies negatively affect performance due to unidirectional attentional constraints, and (3) recalibrating attentional mechanisms to prioritize question-relevant regions improves performance.
Based on these findings, we first propose a family of prompt-based strategies - Step-by-Step Reading (SSR), SSR+, and SSR++ - that guide LLMs to incrementally process question tokens and align their reasoning with the input structure. These methods significantly improve performance, with SSR++ achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks: 96.66% on GSM8K, 94.61% on ASDiv, and 76.28% on AQuA. Second, we introduce a training-free attention recalibration mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention distributions during inference to emphasize question-relevant regions. This method improves the accuracy of LLaMA 3.1-8B on AQuA by 5.17% without changing model parameters or input prompts.
Taken together, our results highlight the importance of structured prompt design and attention optimization in improving LLM comprehension, providing lightweight yet effective tools for improving performance in various NLP tasks.

# Composable NLP Workflows for BERT-based Ranking and QA System 

**Authors**: Gaurav Kumar, Murali Mohana Krishna Dandu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09398)  

**Abstract**: There has been a lot of progress towards building NLP models that scale to multiple tasks. However, real-world systems contain multiple components and it is tedious to handle cross-task interaction with varying levels of text granularity. In this work, we built an end-to-end Ranking and Question-Answering (QA) system using Forte, a toolkit that makes composable NLP pipelines. We utilized state-of-the-art deep learning models such as BERT, RoBERTa in our pipeline, evaluated the performance on MS-MARCO and Covid-19 datasets using metrics such as BLUE, MRR, F1 and compared the results of ranking and QA systems with their corresponding benchmark results. The modular nature of our pipeline and low latency of reranker makes it easy to build complex NLP applications easily.

# Evaluation Under Imperfect Benchmarks and Ratings: A Case Study in Text Simplification 

**Authors**: Joseph Liu, Yoonsoo Nam, Xinyue Cui, Swabha Swayamdipta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09394)  

**Abstract**: Despite the successes of language models, their evaluation remains a daunting challenge for new and existing tasks. We consider the task of text simplification, commonly used to improve information accessibility, where evaluation faces two major challenges. First, the data in existing benchmarks might not reflect the capabilities of current language models on the task, often containing disfluent, incoherent, or simplistic examples. Second, existing human ratings associated with the benchmarks often contain a high degree of disagreement, resulting in inconsistent ratings; nevertheless, existing metrics still have to show higher correlations with these imperfect ratings. As a result, evaluation for the task is not reliable and does not reflect expected trends (e.g., more powerful models being assigned higher scores). We address these challenges for the task of text simplification through three contributions. First, we introduce SynthSimpliEval, a synthetic benchmark for text simplification featuring simplified sentences generated by models of varying sizes. Through a pilot study, we show that human ratings on our benchmark exhibit high inter-annotator agreement and reflect the expected trend: larger models produce higher-quality simplifications. Second, we show that auto-evaluation with a panel of LLM judges (LLMs-as-a-jury) often suffices to obtain consistent ratings for the evaluation of text simplification. Third, we demonstrate that existing learnable metrics for text simplification benefit from training on our LLMs-as-a-jury-rated synthetic data, closing the gap with pure LLMs-as-a-jury for evaluation. Overall, through our case study on text simplification, we show that a reliable evaluation requires higher quality test data, which could be obtained through synthetic data and LLMs-as-a-jury ratings.

# Beyond Memorization: Mapping the Originality-Quality Frontier of Language Models 

**Authors**: Vishakh Padmakumar, Chen Yueh-Han, Jane Pan, Valerie Chen, He He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09389)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for ideation and scientific discovery, it is important to evaluate their ability to generate novel output. Prior work evaluates novelty as the originality with respect to training data, but original outputs can be low quality. In contrast, non-expert judges may favor high-quality but memorized outputs, limiting the reliability of human preference as a metric. We propose a new novelty metric for LLM generations that balances originality and quality -- the harmonic mean of the fraction of \ngrams unseen during training and a task-specific quality score. We evaluate the novelty of generations from two families of open-data models (OLMo and Pythia) on three creative tasks: story completion, poetry writing, and creative tool use. We find that LLM generated text is less novel than human written text. To elicit more novel outputs, we experiment with various inference-time methods, which reveals a trade-off between originality and quality. While these methods can boost novelty, they do so by increasing originality at the expense of quality. In contrast, increasing model size or applying post-training reliably shifts the Pareto frontier, highlighting that starting with a stronger base model is a more effective way to improve novelty.

# On Language Models' Sensitivity to Suspicious Coincidences 

**Authors**: Sriram Padmanabhan, Kanishka Misra, Kyle Mahowald, Eunsol Choi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09387)  

**Abstract**: Humans are sensitive to suspicious coincidences when generalizing inductively over data, as they make assumptions as to how the data was sampled. This results in smaller, more specific hypotheses being favored over more general ones. For instance, when provided the set {Austin, Dallas, Houston}, one is more likely to think that this is sampled from "Texas Cities" over "US Cities" even though both are compatible. Suspicious coincidence is strongly connected to pragmatic reasoning, and can serve as a testbed to analyze systems on their sensitivity towards the communicative goals of the task (i.e., figuring out the true category underlying the data). In this paper, we analyze whether suspicious coincidence effects are reflected in language models' (LMs) behavior. We do so in the context of two domains: 1) the number game, where humans made judgments of whether a number (e.g., 4) fits a list of given numbers (e.g., 16, 32, 2); and 2) by extending the number game setup to prominent cities. For both domains, the data is compatible with multiple hypotheses and we study which hypothesis is most consistent with the models' behavior. On analyzing five models, we do not find strong evidence for suspicious coincidences in LMs' zero-shot behavior. However, when provided access to the hypotheses space via chain-of-thought or explicit prompting, LMs start to show an effect resembling suspicious coincidences, sometimes even showing effects consistent with humans. Our study suggests that inductive reasoning behavior in LMs can be enhanced with explicit access to the hypothesis landscape.

# Can you map it to English? The Role of Cross-Lingual Alignment in Multilingual Performance of LLMs 

**Authors**: Kartik Ravisankar, Hyojung Han, Marine Carpuat  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09378)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained predominantly on English text exhibit surprising multilingual capabilities, yet the mechanisms driving cross-lingual generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates how the alignment of representations for text written in different languages correlates with LLM performance on natural language understanding tasks and translation tasks, both at the language and the instance level. For this purpose, we introduce cross-lingual alignment metrics such as the Discriminative Alignment Index (DALI) to quantify the alignment at an instance level for discriminative tasks. Through experiments on three natural language understanding tasks (Belebele, XStoryCloze, XCOPA), and machine translation, we find that while cross-lingual alignment metrics strongly correlate with task accuracy at the language level, the sample-level alignment often fails to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, exposing alignment as a necessary but insufficient condition for success.

# QUDsim: Quantifying Discourse Similarities in LLM-Generated Text 

**Authors**: Ramya Namuduri, Yating Wu, Anshun Asher Zheng, Manya Wadhwa, Greg Durrett, Junyi Jessy Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09373)  

**Abstract**: As large language models become increasingly capable at various writing tasks, their weakness at generating unique and creative content becomes a major liability. Although LLMs have the ability to generate text covering diverse topics, there is an overall sense of repetitiveness across texts that we aim to formalize and quantify via a similarity metric. The familiarity between documents arises from the persistence of underlying discourse structures. However, existing similarity metrics dependent on lexical overlap and syntactic patterns largely capture $\textit{content}$ overlap, thus making them unsuitable for detecting $\textit{structural}$ similarities. We introduce an abstraction based on linguistic theories in Questions Under Discussion (QUD) and question semantics to help quantify differences in discourse progression. We then use this framework to build $\textbf{QUDsim}$, a similarity metric that can detect discursive parallels between documents. Using QUDsim, we find that LLMs often reuse discourse structures (more so than humans) across samples, even when content differs. Furthermore, LLMs are not only repetitive and structurally uniform, but are also divergent from human authors in the types of structures they use.

# Improving the Accuracy and Efficiency of Legal Document Tagging with Large Language Models and Instruction Prompts 

**Authors**: Emily Johnson, Xavier Holt, Noah Wilson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09309)  

**Abstract**: Legal multi-label classification is a critical task for organizing and accessing the vast amount of legal documentation. Despite its importance, it faces challenges such as the complexity of legal language, intricate label dependencies, and significant label imbalance. In this paper, we propose Legal-LLM, a novel approach that leverages the instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through fine-tuning. We reframe the multi-label classification task as a structured generation problem, instructing the LLM to directly output the relevant legal categories for a given document. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets, POSTURE50K and EURLEX57K, using micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores. Our experimental results demonstrate that Legal-LLM outperforms a range of strong baseline models, including traditional methods and other Transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, ablation studies and human evaluations validate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in handling label imbalance and generating relevant and accurate legal labels.

# Enhancing Contrastive Demonstration Selection with Semantic Diversity for Robust In-Context Machine Translation 

**Authors**: Owen Patterson, Chee Ng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09305)  

**Abstract**: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models to perform tasks by conditioning on a few input-output examples. However, the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of these demonstrations. While existing methods focus on similarity or contrastive selection, they often overlook the importance of diversity among the chosen examples. In this paper, we propose DiverseConE (Diversity-Enhanced Contrastive Example Selection), a novel approach for demonstration selection in in-context learning for machine translation. Our method builds upon contrastive selection by incorporating a diversity enhancement step based on embedding space dissimilarity. We conduct extensive experiments on the Llama2-7b model across four language pairs (English-Chinese, Chinese-English, Russian-German, German-Russian) in 1-shot and 3-shot settings, using COMET20 and COMET22 for evaluation. Our results demonstrate that DiverseConE consistently outperforms strong baseline methods, including random selection, BM25, TopK, and a state-of-the-art contrastive selection method. Further analysis, including diversity metrics and human evaluation, validates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights the benefits of considering demonstration diversity for improved translation quality.

# Feature-Aware Malicious Output Detection and Mitigation 

**Authors**: Weilong Dong, Peiguang Li, Yu Tian, Xinyi Zeng, Fengdi Li, Sirui Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09191)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought significant benefits to various domains while introducing substantial risks. Despite being fine-tuned through reinforcement learning, LLMs lack the capability to discern malicious content, limiting their defense against jailbreak. To address these safety concerns, we propose a feature-aware method for harmful response rejection (FMM), which detects the presence of malicious features within the model's feature space and adaptively adjusts the model's rejection mechanism. By employing a simple discriminator, we detect potential malicious traits during the decoding phase. Upon detecting features indicative of toxic tokens, FMM regenerates the current token. By employing activation patching, an additional rejection vector is incorporated during the subsequent token generation, steering the model towards a refusal response. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple language models and diverse attack techniques, while crucially maintaining the models' standard generation capabilities.

**Abstract**: We present SimpleStories, a large synthetic story dataset in simple language, consisting of 2 million stories each in English and Japanese. Our method employs parametrization of prompts with features at multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for systematic control over story characteristics to ensure broad syntactic and semantic diversity. Building on and addressing limitations in the TinyStories dataset, our approach demonstrates that simplicity and variety can be achieved simultaneously in synthetic text generation at scale.

# Langformers: Unified NLP Pipelines for Language Models 

**Authors**: Rabindra Lamsal, Maria Rodriguez Read, Shanika Karunasekera  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09170)  

**Abstract**: Transformer-based language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). However, using these models often involves navigating multiple frameworks and tools, as well as writing repetitive boilerplate code. This complexity can discourage non-programmers and beginners, and even slow down prototyping for experienced developers. To address these challenges, we introduce Langformers, an open-source Python library designed to streamline NLP pipelines through a unified, factory-based interface for large language model (LLM) and masked language model (MLM) tasks. Langformers integrates conversational AI, MLM pretraining, text classification, sentence embedding/reranking, data labelling, semantic search, and knowledge distillation into a cohesive API, supporting popular platforms such as Hugging Face and Ollama. Key innovations include: (1) task-specific factories that abstract training, inference, and deployment complexities; (2) built-in memory and streaming for conversational agents; and (3) lightweight, modular design that prioritizes ease of use.

# Can postgraduate translation students identify machine-generated text? 

**Authors**: Michael Farrell  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09164)  

**Abstract**: Given the growing use of generative artificial intelligence as a tool for creating multilingual content and bypassing both machine and traditional translation methods, this study explores the ability of linguistically trained individuals to discern machine-generated output from human-written text (HT). After brief training sessions on the textual anomalies typically found in synthetic text (ST), twenty-three postgraduate translation students analysed excerpts of Italian prose and assigned likelihood scores to indicate whether they believed they were human-written or AI-generated (ChatGPT-4o). The results show that, on average, the students struggled to distinguish between HT and ST, with only two participants achieving notable accuracy. Closer analysis revealed that the students often identified the same textual anomalies in both HT and ST, although features such as low burstiness and self-contradiction were more frequently associated with ST. These findings suggest the need for improvements in the preparatory training. Moreover, the study raises questions about the necessity of editing synthetic text to make it sound more human-like and recommends further research to determine whether AI-generated text is already sufficiently natural-sounding not to require further refinement.

# Efficient and Asymptotically Unbiased Constrained Decoding for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Haotian Ye, Himanshu Jain, Chong You, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Haowei Lin, James Zou, Felix Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09135)  

**Abstract**: In real-world applications of large language models, outputs are often required to be confined: selecting items from predefined product or document sets, generating phrases that comply with safety standards, or conforming to specialized formatting styles. To control the generation, constrained decoding has been widely adopted. However, existing prefix-tree-based constrained decoding is inefficient under GPU-based model inference paradigms, and it introduces unintended biases into the output distribution. This paper introduces Dynamic Importance Sampling for Constrained Decoding (DISC) with GPU-based Parallel Prefix-Verification (PPV), a novel algorithm that leverages dynamic importance sampling to achieve theoretically guaranteed asymptotic unbiasedness and overcomes the inefficiency of prefix-tree. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing methods in both efficiency and output quality. These results highlight the potential of our methods to improve constrained generation in applications where adherence to specific constraints is essential.

# VisuoThink: Empowering LVLM Reasoning with Multimodal Tree Search 

**Authors**: Yikun Wang, Siyin Wang, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhaoye Fei, Liang Ding, Qipeng Guo, Dacheng Tao, Xipeng Qiu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09130)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models have showcased remarkable capabilities. However, they often falter when confronted with complex reasoning tasks that humans typically address through visual aids and deliberate, step-by-step thinking. While existing methods have explored text-based slow thinking or rudimentary visual assistance, they fall short of capturing the intricate, interleaved nature of human visual-verbal reasoning processes. To overcome these limitations and inspired by the mechanisms of slow thinking in human cognition, we introduce VisuoThink, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates visuospatial and linguistic domains. VisuoThink facilitates multimodal slow thinking by enabling progressive visual-textual reasoning and incorporates test-time scaling through look-ahead tree search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisuoThink significantly enhances reasoning capabilities via inference-time scaling, even without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving geometry and spatial reasoning.

# Optimizing FDTD Solvers for Electromagnetics: A Compiler-Guided Approach with High-Level Tensor Abstractions 

**Authors**: Yifei He, Måns I. Andersson, Stefano Markidis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09118)  

**Abstract**: The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is a widely used numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations, particularly in computational electromagnetics and photonics. It enables accurate modeling of wave propagation in complex media and structures but comes with significant computational challenges. Traditional FDTD implementations rely on handwritten, platform-specific code that optimizes certain kernels while underperforming in others. The lack of portability increases development overhead and creates performance bottlenecks, limiting scalability across modern hardware architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end domain-specific compiler based on the MLIR/LLVM infrastructure for FDTD simulations. Our approach generates efficient and portable code optimized for diverse hardware this http URL implement the three-dimensional FDTD kernel as operations on a 3D tensor abstraction with explicit computational semantics. High-level optimizations such as loop tiling, fusion, and vectorization are automatically applied by the compiler. We evaluate our customized code generation pipeline on Intel, AMD, and ARM platforms, achieving up to $10\times$ speedup over baseline Python implementation using NumPy.

# Enhancing Dialogue Systems with Discourse-Level Understanding Using Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis 

**Authors**: Akanksha Mehndiratta, Krishna Asawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09094)  

**Abstract**: The evolution of conversational agents has been driven by the need for more contextually aware systems that can effectively manage dialogue over extended interactions. To address the limitations of existing models in capturing and utilizing long-term conversational history, we propose a novel framework that integrates Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) for discourse-level understanding. This framework learns discourse tokens to capture relationships between utterances and their surrounding context, enabling a better understanding of long-term dependencies. Experiments on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus demonstrate significant enhancement in response selection, based on the improved automatic evaluation metric scores. The results highlight the potential of DCCA in improving dialogue systems by allowing them to filter out irrelevant context and retain critical discourse information for more accurate response retrieval.

# A Multi-view Discourse Framework for Integrating Semantic and Syntactic Features in Dialog Agents 

**Authors**: Akanksha Mehndiratta, Krishna Asawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09073)  

**Abstract**: Multiturn dialogue models aim to generate human-like responses by leveraging conversational context, consisting of utterances from previous exchanges. Existing methods often neglect the interactions between these utterances or treat all of them as equally significant. This paper introduces a discourse-aware framework for response selection in retrieval-based dialogue systems. The proposed model first encodes each utterance and response with contextual, positional, and syntactic features using Multi-view Canonical Correlation Analysis (MCCA). It then learns discourse tokens that capture relationships between an utterance and its surrounding turns in a shared subspace via Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). This two-step approach effectively integrates semantic and syntactic features to build discourse-level understanding. Experiments on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in automatic evaluation metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in response selection.

# Exploration of Plan-Guided Summarization for Narrative Texts: the Case of Small Language Models 

**Authors**: Matt Grenander, Siddharth Varia, Paula Czarnowska, Yogarshi Vyas, Kishaloy Halder, Bonan Min  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09071)  

**Abstract**: Plan-guided summarization attempts to reduce hallucinations in small language models (SLMs) by grounding generated summaries to the source text, typically by targeting fine-grained details such as dates or named entities. In this work, we investigate whether plan-based approaches in SLMs improve summarization in long document, narrative tasks. Narrative texts' length and complexity often mean they are difficult to summarize faithfully. We analyze existing plan-guided solutions targeting fine-grained details, and also propose our own higher-level, narrative-based plan formulation. Our results show that neither approach significantly improves on a baseline without planning in either summary quality or faithfulness. Human evaluation reveals that while plan-guided approaches are often well grounded to their plan, plans are equally likely to contain hallucinations compared to summaries. As a result, the plan-guided summaries are just as unfaithful as those from models without planning. Our work serves as a cautionary tale to plan-guided approaches to summarization, especially for long, complex domains such as narrative texts.

# From Punchlines to Predictions: A Metric to Assess LLM Performance in Identifying Humor in Stand-Up Comedy 

**Authors**: Adrianna Romanowski, Pedro H. V. Valois, Kazuhiro Fukui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09049)  

**Abstract**: Comedy serves as a profound reflection of the times we live in and is a staple element of human interactions. In light of the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), the intersection of humor and AI has become no laughing matter. Advancements in the naturalness of human-computer interaction correlates with improvements in AI systems' abilities to understand humor. In this study, we assess the ability of models in accurately identifying humorous quotes from a stand-up comedy transcript. Stand-up comedy's unique comedic narratives make it an ideal dataset to improve the overall naturalness of comedic understanding. We propose a novel humor detection metric designed to evaluate LLMs amongst various prompts on their capability to extract humorous punchlines. The metric has a modular structure that offers three different scoring methods - fuzzy string matching, sentence embedding, and subspace similarity - to provide an overarching assessment of a model's performance. The model's results are compared against those of human evaluators on the same task. Our metric reveals that regardless of prompt engineering, leading models, ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek, achieve scores of at most 51% in humor detection. Notably, this performance surpasses that of humans who achieve a score of 41%. The analysis of human evaluators and LLMs reveals variability in agreement, highlighting the subjectivity inherent in humor and the complexities involved in extracting humorous quotes from live performance transcripts.

# A Fully Automated Pipeline for Conversational Discourse Annotation: Tree Scheme Generation and Labeling with Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Kseniia Petukhova, Ekaterina Kochmar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08961)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating discourse annotation for conversations. While manually designing tree annotation schemes significantly improves annotation quality for humans and models, their creation remains time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. We propose a fully automated pipeline that uses LLMs to construct such schemes and perform annotation. We evaluate our approach on speech functions (SFs) and the Switchboard-DAMSL (SWBD-DAMSL) taxonomies. Our experiments compare various design choices, and we show that frequency-guided decision trees, paired with an advanced LLM for annotation, can outperform previously manually designed trees and even match or surpass human annotators while significantly reducing the time required for annotation. We release all code and resultant schemes and annotations to facilitate future research on discourse annotation.

# Generating Planning Feedback for Open-Ended Programming Exercises with LLMs 

**Authors**: Mehmet Arif Demirtaş, Claire Zheng, Max Fowler, Kathryn Cunningham  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08958)  

**Abstract**: To complete an open-ended programming exercise, students need to both plan a high-level solution and implement it using the appropriate syntax. However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.

# Forecasting Communication Derailments Through Conversation Generation 

**Authors**: Yunfan Zhang, Kathleen McKeown, Smaranda Muresan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08905)  

**Abstract**: Forecasting communication derailment can be useful in real-world settings such as online content moderation, conflict resolution, and business negotiations. However, despite language models' success at identifying offensive speech present in conversations, they struggle to forecast future communication derailments. In contrast to prior work that predicts conversation outcomes solely based on the past conversation history, our approach samples multiple future conversation trajectories conditioned on existing conversation history using a fine-tuned LLM. It predicts the communication outcome based on the consensus of these trajectories. We also experimented with leveraging socio-linguistic attributes, which reflect turn-level conversation dynamics, as guidance when generating future conversations. Our method of future conversation trajectories surpasses state-of-the-art results on English communication derailment prediction benchmarks and demonstrates significant accuracy gains in ablation studies.

# SD$^2$: Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters 

**Authors**: Mike Lasby, Nish Sinnadurai, Valavan Manohararajah, Sean Lie, Vithursan Thangarasa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08838)  

**Abstract**: Speculative decoding is a powerful technique for reducing the latency of Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a fault-tolerant framework that enables the use of highly compressed draft models. In this work, we introduce Self-Distilled Sparse Drafters (SD$^2$), a novel methodology that leverages self-data distillation and fine-grained weight sparsity to produce highly efficient and well-aligned draft models. SD$^2$ systematically enhances draft token acceptance rates while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate operations (MACs), even in the Universal Assisted Generation (UAG) setting, where draft and target models originate from different model families. On a Llama-3.1-70B target model, SD$^2$ provides a $\times$1.59 higher Mean Accepted Length (MAL) compared to layer-pruned draft models and reduces MACs by over 43.87% with a 8.36% reduction in MAL compared to a dense draft models. Our results highlight the potential of sparsity-aware fine-tuning and compression strategies to improve LLM inference efficiency while maintaining alignment with target models.

# CAReDiO: Cultural Alignment of LLM via Representativeness and Distinctiveness Guided Data Optimization 

**Authors**: Jing Yao, Xiaoyuan Yi, Jindong Wang, Zhicheng Dou, Xing Xie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08820)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) more deeply integrate into human life across various regions, aligning them with pluralistic cultures is crucial for improving user experience and mitigating cultural conflicts. Existing approaches develop culturally aligned LLMs primarily through fine-tuning with massive carefully curated culture-specific corpora. Nevertheless, inspired by culture theories, we identify two key challenges faced by these datasets: (1) Representativeness: These corpora fail to fully capture the target culture's core characteristics with redundancy, causing computation waste; (2) Distinctiveness: They struggle to distinguish the unique nuances of a given culture from shared patterns across other relevant ones, hindering precise cultural modeling. To handle these challenges, we introduce CAReDiO, a novel cultural data construction framework. Specifically, CAReDiO utilizes powerful LLMs to automatically generate cultural conversation data, where both the queries and responses are further optimized by maximizing representativeness and distinctiveness. Using CAReDiO, we construct a small yet effective dataset, covering five cultures, and compare it with several recent cultural corpora. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more effective data and enables cultural alignment with as few as 100 training samples, enhancing both performance and efficiency.

# Exploring the Effectiveness and Interpretability of Texts in LLM-based Time Series Models 

**Authors**: Zhengke Sun, Hangwei Qian, Ivor Tsang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08808)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to time series forecasting tasks, leveraging pre-trained language models as the backbone and incorporating textual data to purportedly enhance the comprehensive capabilities of LLMs for time series. However, are these texts really helpful for interpretation? This study seeks to investigate the actual efficacy and interpretability of such textual incorporations. Through a series of empirical experiments on textual prompts and textual prototypes, our findings reveal that the misalignment between two modalities exists, and the textual information does not significantly improve time series forecasting performance in many cases. Furthermore, visualization analysis indicates that the textual representations learned by existing frameworks lack sufficient interpretability when applied to time series data. We further propose a novel metric named Semantic Matching Index (SMI) to better evaluate the matching degree between time series and texts during our post hoc interpretability investigation. Our analysis reveals the misalignment and limited interpretability of texts in current time-series LLMs, and we hope this study can raise awareness of the interpretability of texts for time series. The code is available at this https URL.

# Exploring Gradient-Guided Masked Language Model to Detect Textual Adversarial Attacks 

**Authors**: Xiaomei Zhang, Zhaoxi Zhang, Yanjun Zhang, Xufei Zheng, Leo Yu Zhang, Shengshan Hu, Shirui Pan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08798)  

**Abstract**: Textual adversarial examples pose serious threats to the reliability of natural language processing systems. Recent studies suggest that adversarial examples tend to deviate from the underlying manifold of normal texts, whereas pre-trained masked language models can approximate the manifold of normal data. These findings inspire the exploration of masked language models for detecting textual adversarial attacks. We first introduce Masked Language Model-based Detection (MLMD), leveraging the mask and unmask operations of the masked language modeling (MLM) objective to induce the difference in manifold changes between normal and adversarial texts. Although MLMD achieves competitive detection performance, its exhaustive one-by-one masking strategy introduces significant computational overhead. Our posterior analysis reveals that a significant number of non-keywords in the input are not important for detection but consume resources. Building on this, we introduce Gradient-guided MLMD (GradMLMD), which leverages gradient information to identify and skip non-keywords during detection, significantly reducing resource consumption without compromising detection performance.

# Enhancing NER Performance in Low-Resource Pakistani Languages using Cross-Lingual Data Augmentation 

**Authors**: Toqeer Ehsan, Thamar Solorio  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08792)  

**Abstract**: Named Entity Recognition (NER), a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), has shown significant advancements for high-resource languages. However, due to a lack of annotated datasets and limited representation in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), it remains understudied and challenging for low-resource languages. To address these challenges, we propose a data augmentation technique that generates culturally plausible sentences and experiments on four low-resource Pakistani languages; Urdu, Shahmukhi, Sindhi, and Pashto. By fine-tuning multilingual masked Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach demonstrates significant improvements in NER performance for Shahmukhi and Pashto. We further explore the capability of generative LLMs for NER and data augmentation using few-shot learning.

# Efficient Evaluation of Large Language Models via Collaborative Filtering 

**Authors**: Xu-Xiang Zhong, Chao Yi, Han-Jia Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08781)  

**Abstract**: With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous benchmarks have been proposed to measure and compare the capabilities of different LLMs. However, evaluating LLMs is costly due to the large number of test instances and their slow inference speed. In this paper, we aim to explore how to efficiently estimate a model's real performance on a given benchmark based on its evaluation results on a small number of instances sampled from the benchmark. Inspired by Collaborative Filtering (CF) in Recommendation Systems (RS), we treat LLMs as users and test instances as items and propose a two-stage method. In the first stage, we treat instance selection as recommending products to users to choose instances that can easily distinguish model performance. In the second stage, we see performance prediction as rating prediction problem in RS to predict the target LLM's behavior on unselected instances. Experiments on multiple LLMs and datasets imply that our method can accurately estimate the target model's performance while largely reducing its inference overhead.

# Can AI Master Construction Management (CM)? Benchmarking State-of-the-Art Large Language Models on CM Certification Exams 

**Authors**: Ruoxin Xiong, Yanyu Wang, Suat Gunhan, Yimin Zhu, Charles Berryman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08779)  

**Abstract**: The growing complexity of construction management (CM) projects, coupled with challenges such as strict regulatory requirements and labor shortages, requires specialized analytical tools that streamline project workflow and enhance performance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in general reasoning tasks, their effectiveness in tackling CM-specific challenges, such as precise quantitative analysis and regulatory interpretation, remains inadequately explored. To bridge this gap, this study introduces CMExamSet, a comprehensive benchmarking dataset comprising 689 authentic multiple-choice questions sourced from four nationally accredited CM certification exams. Our zero-shot evaluation assesses overall accuracy, subject areas (e.g., construction safety), reasoning complexity (single-step and multi-step), and question formats (text-only, figure-referenced, and table-referenced). The results indicate that GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 surpass typical human pass thresholds (70%), with average accuracies of 82% and 83%, respectively. Additionally, both models performed better on single-step tasks, with accuracies of 85.7% (GPT-4o) and 86.7% (Claude 3.7). Multi-step tasks were more challenging, reducing performance to 76.5% and 77.6%, respectively. Furthermore, both LLMs show significant limitations on figure-referenced questions, with accuracies dropping to approximately 40%. Our error pattern analysis further reveals that conceptual misunderstandings are the most common (44.4% and 47.9%), underscoring the need for enhanced domain-specific reasoning models. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as valuable supplementary analytical tools in CM, while highlighting the need for domain-specific refinements and sustained human oversight in complex decision making.

# From Tokens to Lattices: Emergent Lattice Structures in Language Models 

**Authors**: Bo Xiong, Steffen Staab  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08778)  

**Abstract**: Pretrained masked language models (MLMs) have demonstrated an impressive capability to comprehend and encode conceptual knowledge, revealing a lattice structure among concepts. This raises a critical question: how does this conceptualization emerge from MLM pretraining? In this paper, we explore this problem from the perspective of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), a mathematical framework that derives concept lattices from the observations of object-attribute relationships. We show that the MLM's objective implicitly learns a \emph{formal context} that describes objects, attributes, and their dependencies, which enables the reconstruction of a concept lattice through FCA. We propose a novel framework for concept lattice construction from pretrained MLMs and investigate the origin of the inductive biases of MLMs in lattice structure learning. Our framework differs from previous work because it does not rely on human-defined concepts and allows for discovering "latent" concepts that extend beyond human definitions. We create three datasets for evaluation, and the empirical results verify our hypothesis.

# SemCAFE: When Named Entities make the Difference Assessing Web Source Reliability through Entity-level Analytics 

**Authors**: Gautam Kishore Shahi, Oshani Seneviratne, Marc Spaniol  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08776)  

**Abstract**: With the shift from traditional to digital media, the online landscape now hosts not only reliable news articles but also a significant amount of unreliable content. Digital media has faster reachability by significantly influencing public opinion and advancing political agendas. While newspaper readers may be familiar with their preferred outlets political leanings or credibility, determining unreliable news articles is much more challenging. The credibility of many online sources is often opaque, with AI generated content being easily disseminated at minimal cost. Unreliable news articles, particularly those that followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, closely mimic the topics and writing styles of credible sources, making them difficult to distinguish. To address this, we introduce SemCAFE, a system designed to detect news reliability by incorporating entity relatedness into its assessment. SemCAFE employs standard Natural Language Processing techniques, such as boilerplate removal and tokenization, alongside entity level semantic analysis using the YAGO knowledge base. By creating a semantic fingerprint for each news article, SemCAFE could assess the credibility of 46,020 reliable and 3,407 unreliable articles on the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our approach improved the macro F1 score by 12% over state of the art methods. The sample data and code are available on GitHub

# Layers at Similar Depths Generate Similar Activations Across LLM Architectures 

**Authors**: Christopher Wolfram, Aaron Schein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08775)  

**Abstract**: How do the latent spaces used by independently-trained LLMs relate to one another? We study the nearest neighbor relationships induced by activations at different layers of 24 open-weight LLMs, and find that they 1) tend to vary from layer to layer within a model, and 2) are approximately shared between corresponding layers of different models. Claim 2 shows that these nearest neighbor relationships are not arbitrary, as they are shared across models, but Claim 1 shows that they are not "obvious" either, as there is no single set of nearest neighbor relationships that is universally shared. Together, these suggest that LLMs generate a progression of activation geometries from layer to layer, but that this entire progression is largely shared between models, stretched and squeezed to fit into different architectures.

# MIEB: Massive Image Embedding Benchmark 

**Authors**: Chenghao Xiao, Isaac Chung, Imene Kerboua, Jamie Stirling, Xin Zhang, Márton Kardos, Roman Solomatin, Noura Al Moubayed, Kenneth Enevoldsen, Niklas Muennighoff  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10471)  

**Abstract**: Image representations are often evaluated through disjointed, task-specific protocols, leading to a fragmented understanding of model capabilities. For instance, it is unclear whether an image embedding model adept at clustering images is equally good at retrieving relevant images given a piece of text. We introduce the Massive Image Embedding Benchmark (MIEB) to evaluate the performance of image and image-text embedding models across the broadest spectrum to date. MIEB spans 38 languages across 130 individual tasks, which we group into 8 high-level categories. We benchmark 50 models across our benchmark, finding that no single method dominates across all task categories. We reveal hidden capabilities in advanced vision models such as their accurate visual representation of texts, and their yet limited capabilities in interleaved encodings and matching images and texts in the presence of confounders. We also show that the performance of vision encoders on MIEB correlates highly with their performance when used in multimodal large language models. Our code, dataset, and leaderboard are publicly available at this https URL.

# GUI-R1 : A Generalist R1-Style Vision-Language Action Model For GUI Agents 

**Authors**: Xiaobo Xia, Run Luo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10458)  

**Abstract**: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.

# RealWebAssist: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Web Assistance with Real-World Users 

**Authors**: Suyu Ye, Haojun Shi, Darren Shih, Hyokun Yun, Tanya Roosta, Tianmin Shu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10445)  

**Abstract**: To achieve successful assistance with long-horizon web-based tasks, AI agents must be able to sequentially follow real-world user instructions over a long period. Unlike existing web-based agent benchmarks, sequential instruction following in the real world poses significant challenges beyond performing a single, clearly defined task. For instance, real-world human instructions can be ambiguous, require different levels of AI assistance, and may evolve over time, reflecting changes in the user's mental state. To address this gap, we introduce RealWebAssist, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate sequential instruction-following in realistic scenarios involving long-horizon interactions with the web, visual GUI grounding, and understanding ambiguous real-world user instructions. RealWebAssist includes a dataset of sequential instructions collected from real-world human users. Each user instructs a web-based assistant to perform a series of tasks on multiple websites. A successful agent must reason about the true intent behind each instruction, keep track of the mental state of the user, understand user-specific routines, and ground the intended tasks to actions on the correct GUI elements. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art models struggle to understand and ground user instructions, posing critical challenges in following real-world user instructions for long-horizon web assistance.

# Multimodal Long Video Modeling Based on Temporal Dynamic Context 

**Authors**: Haoran Hao, Jiaming Han, Yiyuan Zhang, Xiangyu Yue  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10443)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in video understanding. However, existing models still struggle with long video processing due to the context length constraint of LLMs and the vast amount of information within the video. Although some recent methods are designed for long video understanding, they often lose crucial information during token compression and struggle with additional modality like audio. In this work, we propose a dynamic long video encoding method utilizing the temporal relationship between frames, named Temporal Dynamic Context (TDC). Firstly, we segment the video into semantically consistent scenes based on inter-frame similarities, then encode each frame into tokens using visual-audio encoders. Secondly, we propose a novel temporal context compressor to reduce the number of tokens within each segment. Specifically, we employ a query-based Transformer to aggregate video, audio, and instruction text tokens into a limited set of temporal context tokens. Finally, we feed the static frame tokens and the temporal context tokens into the LLM for video understanding. Furthermore, to handle extremely long videos, we propose a training-free chain-of-thought strategy that progressively extracts answers from multiple video segments. These intermediate answers serve as part of the reasoning process and contribute to the final answer. We conduct extensive experiments on general video understanding and audio-video understanding benchmarks, where our method demonstrates strong performance.

# A 10.8mW Mixed-Signal Simulated Bifurcation Ising Solver using SRAM Compute-In-Memory with 0.6us Time-to-Solution 

**Authors**: Alana Marie Dee, Sajjad Moazeni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10384)  

**Abstract**: Combinatorial optimization problems are funda- mental for various fields ranging from finance to wireless net- works. This work presents a simulated bifurcation (SB) Ising solver in CMOS for NP-hard optimization problems. Analog domain computing led to a superior implementation of this algorithm as inherent and injected noise is required in SB Ising solvers. The architecture novelties include the use of SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) to accelerate bifurcation as well as the generation and injection of optimal decaying noise in the analog domain. We propose a novel 10-T SRAM cell capable of performing ternary multiplication. When measured with 60- node, 50% density, random, binary MAXCUT graphs, this all- to-all connected Ising solver reliably achieves above 93% of the ground state solution in 0.6us with 10.8mW average power in TSMC 180nm CMOS. Our chip achieves an order of magnitude improvement in time-to-solution and power compared to previously proposed Ising solvers in CMOS and other platforms.

# Pseudo-Autoregressive Neural Codec Language Models for Efficient Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Synthesis 

**Authors**: Yifan Yang, Shujie Liu, Jinyu Li, Yuxuan Hu, Haibin Wu, Hui Wang, Jianwei Yu, Lingwei Meng, Haiyang Sun, Yanqing Liu, Yan Lu, Kai Yu, Xie Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10352)  

**Abstract**: Recent zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems face a common dilemma: autoregressive (AR) models suffer from slow generation and lack duration controllability, while non-autoregressive (NAR) models lack temporal modeling and typically require complex designs. In this paper, we introduce a novel pseudo-autoregressive (PAR) codec language modeling approach that unifies AR and NAR modeling. Combining explicit temporal modeling from AR with parallel generation from NAR, PAR generates dynamic-length spans at fixed time steps. Building on PAR, we propose PALLE, a two-stage TTS system that leverages PAR for initial generation followed by NAR refinement. In the first stage, PAR progressively generates speech tokens along the time dimension, with each step predicting all positions in parallel but only retaining the left-most span. In the second stage, low-confidence tokens are iteratively refined in parallel, leveraging the global contextual information. Experiments demonstrate that PALLE, trained on LibriTTS, outperforms state-of-the-art systems trained on large-scale data, including F5-TTS, E2-TTS, and MaskGCT, on the LibriSpeech test-clean set in terms of speech quality, speaker similarity, and intelligibility, while achieving up to ten times faster inference speed.

# RealHarm: A Collection of Real-World Language Model Application Failures 

**Authors**: Pierre Le Jeune, Jiaen Liu, Luca Rossi, Matteo Dora  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10277)  

**Abstract**: Language model deployments in consumer-facing applications introduce numerous risks. While existing research on harms and hazards of such applications follows top-down approaches derived from regulatory frameworks and theoretical analyses, empirical evidence of real-world failure modes remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RealHarm, a dataset of annotated problematic interactions with AI agents built from a systematic review of publicly reported incidents. Analyzing harms, causes, and hazards specifically from the deployer's perspective, we find that reputational damage constitutes the predominant organizational harm, while misinformation emerges as the most common hazard category. We empirically evaluate state-of-the-art guardrails and content moderation systems to probe whether such systems would have prevented the incidents, revealing a significant gap in the protection of AI applications.

# MURR: Model Updating with Regularized Replay for Searching a Document Stream 

**Authors**: Eugene Yang, Nicola Tonellotto, Dawn Lawrie, Sean MacAvaney, James Mayfield, Douglas W. Oard, Scott Miller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10250)  

**Abstract**: The Internet produces a continuous stream of new documents and user-generated queries. These naturally change over time based on events in the world and the evolution of language. Neural retrieval models that were trained once on a fixed set of query-document pairs will quickly start misrepresenting newly-created content and queries, leading to less effective retrieval. Traditional statistical sparse retrieval can update collection statistics to reflect these changes in the use of language in documents and queries. In contrast, continued fine-tuning of the language model underlying neural retrieval approaches such as DPR and ColBERT creates incompatibility with previously-encoded documents. Re-encoding and re-indexing all previously-processed documents can be costly. In this work, we explore updating a neural dual encoder retrieval model without reprocessing past documents in the stream. We propose MURR, a model updating strategy with regularized replay, to ensure the model can still faithfully search existing documents without reprocessing, while continuing to update the model for the latest topics. In our simulated streaming environments, we show that fine-tuning models using MURR leads to more effective and more consistent retrieval results than other strategies as the stream of documents and queries progresses.

# The Future of MLLM Prompting is Adaptive: A Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation of Prompt Engineering Methods for Robust Multimodal Performance 

**Authors**: Anwesha Mohanty, Venkatesh Balavadhani Parthasarathy, Arsalan Shahid  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10179)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are set to transform how machines process and generate human-like responses by integrating diverse modalities such as text, images, and code. Yet, effectively harnessing their capabilities hinges on optimal prompt engineering. We present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of seven prompt engineering methods applied to 13 open-source MLLMs over 24 tasks spanning Reasoning and Compositionality, Multimodal Understanding and Alignment, Complex Code Generation and Execution, and Knowledge Retrieval and Integration. Our approach stratifies models by parameter count into Small (<4B), Medium (4B-10B), and Large (>10B) categories and compares prompting techniques including Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Analogical, Generated Knowledge, and Tree-of-Thought. While Large MLLMs excel in structured tasks such as code generation, achieving accuracies up to 96.88% under Few-Shot prompting, all models struggle with complex reasoning and abstract understanding, often yielding accuracies below 60% and high hallucination rates. Structured reasoning prompts frequently increased hallucination up to 75% in small models and led to longer response times (over 20 seconds in Large MLLMs), while simpler prompting methods provided more concise and efficient outputs. No single prompting method uniformly optimises all task types. Instead, adaptive strategies combining example-based guidance with selective structured reasoning are essential to enhance robustness, efficiency, and factual accuracy. Our findings offer practical recommendations for prompt engineering and support more reliable deployment of MLLMs across applications including AI-assisted coding, knowledge retrieval, and multimodal content understanding.

# Breaking the Data Barrier -- Building GUI Agents Through Task Generalization 

**Authors**: Junlei Zhang, Zichen Ding, Chang Ma, Zijie Chen, Qiushi Sun, Zhenzhong Lan, Junxian He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10127)  

**Abstract**: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents offer cross-platform solutions for automating complex digital tasks, with significant potential to transform productivity workflows. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. To address this limitation, we propose training Vision Language Models (VLMs) on data-rich, reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training stage, and then examine how incorporating these tasks facilitates generalization to GUI planning scenarios. Specifically, we explore a range of tasks with readily available instruction-tuning data, including GUI perception, multimodal reasoning, and textual reasoning. Through extensive experiments across 11 mid-training tasks, we demonstrate that: (1) Task generalization proves highly effective, yielding substantial improvements across most settings. For instance, multimodal mathematical reasoning enhances performance on AndroidWorld by an absolute 6.3%. Remarkably, text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance, achieving a 5.6% improvement on WebArena and 5.4% improvement on AndroidWorld, underscoring notable cross-modal generalization from text-based to visual domains; (2) Contrary to prior assumptions, GUI perception data - previously considered closely aligned with GUI agent tasks and widely utilized for training - has a comparatively limited impact on final performance; (3) Building on these insights, we identify the most effective mid-training tasks and curate optimized mixture datasets, resulting in absolute performance gains of 8.0% on WebArena and 12.2% on AndroidWorld. Our work provides valuable insights into cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agents and offers a practical approach to addressing data scarcity challenges in this emerging field. The code, data and models will be available at this https URL.

# CameraBench: Benchmarking Visual Reasoning in MLLMs via Photography 

**Authors**: I-Sheng Fang, Jun-Cheng Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10090)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. However, visual reasoning, reasoning involving both visual and textual inputs, remains underexplored. Recent advancements, including the reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, which incorporate image inputs, have opened this capability. In this ongoing work, we focus specifically on photography-related tasks because a photo is a visual snapshot of the physical world where the underlying physics (i.e., illumination, blur extent, etc.) interplay with the camera parameters. Successfully reasoning from the visual information of a photo to identify these numerical camera settings requires the MLLMs to have a deeper understanding of the underlying physics for precise visual comprehension, representing a challenging and intelligent capability essential for practical applications like photography assistant agents. We aim to evaluate MLLMs on their ability to distinguish visual differences related to numerical camera settings, extending a methodology previously proposed for vision-language models (VLMs). Our preliminary results demonstrate the importance of visual reasoning in photography-related tasks. Moreover, these results show that no single MLLM consistently dominates across all evaluation tasks, demonstrating ongoing challenges and opportunities in developing MLLMs with better visual reasoning.

# RealSafe-R1: Safety-Aligned DeepSeek-R1 without Compromising Reasoning Capability 

**Authors**: Yichi Zhang, Zihao Zeng, Dongbai Li, Yao Huang, Zhijie Deng, Yinpeng Dong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10081)  

**Abstract**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have been rapidly progressing and achieving breakthrough performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, the open-source R1 models have raised safety concerns in wide applications, such as the tendency to comply with malicious queries, which greatly impacts the utility of these powerful models in their applications. In this paper, we introduce RealSafe-R1 as safety-aligned versions of DeepSeek-R1 distilled models. To train these models, we construct a dataset of 15k safety-aware reasoning trajectories generated by DeepSeek-R1, under explicit instructions for expected refusal behavior. Both quantitative experiments and qualitative case studies demonstrate the models' improvements, which are shown in their safety guardrails against both harmful queries and jailbreak attacks. Importantly, unlike prior safety alignment efforts that often compromise reasoning performance, our method preserves the models' reasoning capabilities by maintaining the training data within the original distribution of generation. Model weights of RealSafe-R1 are open-source at this https URL.

# Mavors: Multi-granularity Video Representation for Multimodal Large Language Model 

**Authors**: Yang Shi, Jiaheng Liu, Yushuo Guan, Zhenhua Wu, Yuanxing Zhang, Zihao Wang, Weihong Lin, Jingyun Hua, Zekun Wang, Xinlong Chen, Bohan Zeng, Wentao Zhang, Fuzheng Zhang, Wenjing Yang, Di Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10068)  

**Abstract**: Long-context video understanding in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) faces a critical challenge: balancing computational efficiency with the retention of fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns. Existing approaches (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling with low resolution, and token compression) suffer from significant information loss in temporal dynamics, spatial details, or subtle interactions, particularly in videos with complex motion or varying resolutions. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{Mavors}$, a novel framework that introduces $\mathbf{M}$ulti-gr$\mathbf{a}$nularity $\mathbf{v}$ide$\mathbf{o}$ $\mathbf{r}$epre$\mathbf{s}$entation for holistic long-video modeling. Specifically, Mavors directly encodes raw video content into latent representations through two core components: 1) an Intra-chunk Vision Encoder (IVE) that preserves high-resolution spatial features via 3D convolutions and Vision Transformers, and 2) an Inter-chunk Feature Aggregator (IFA) that establishes temporal coherence across chunks using transformer-based dependency modeling with chunk-level rotary position encodings. Moreover, the framework unifies image and video understanding by treating images as single-frame videos via sub-image decomposition. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate Mavors' superiority in maintaining both spatial fidelity and temporal continuity, significantly outperforming existing methods in tasks requiring fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning.

# Joint Action Language Modelling for Transparent Policy Execution 

**Authors**: Theodor Wulff, Rahul Singh Maharjan, Xinyun Chi, Angelo Cangelosi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10055)  

**Abstract**: An agent's intention often remains hidden behind the black-box nature of embodied policies. Communication using natural language statements that describe the next action can provide transparency towards the agent's behavior. We aim to insert transparent behavior directly into the learning process, by transforming the problem of policy learning into a language generation problem and combining it with traditional autoregressive modelling. The resulting model produces transparent natural language statements followed by tokens representing the specific actions to solve long-horizon tasks in the Language-Table environment. Following previous work, the model is able to learn to produce a policy represented by special discretized tokens in an autoregressive manner. We place special emphasis on investigating the relationship between predicting actions and producing high-quality language for a transparent agent. We find that in many cases both the quality of the action trajectory and the transparent statement increase when they are generated simultaneously.

# Summarization of Multimodal Presentations with Vision-Language Models: Study of the Effect of Modalities and Structure 

**Authors**: Théo Gigant, Camille Guinaudeau, Frédéric Dufaux  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10049)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process visual and textual information in multiple formats: texts, images, interleaved texts and images, or even hour-long videos. In this work, we conduct fine-grained quantitative and qualitative analyses of automatic summarization of multimodal presentations using VLMs with various representations as input. From these experiments, we suggest cost-effective strategies for generating summaries from text-heavy multimodal documents under different input-length budgets using VLMs. We show that slides extracted from the video stream can be beneficially used as input against the raw video, and that a structured representation from interleaved slides and transcript provides the best performance. Finally, we reflect and comment on the nature of cross-modal interactions in multimodal presentations and share suggestions to improve the capabilities of VLMs to understand documents of this nature.

# Do We Really Need Curated Malicious Data for Safety Alignment in Multi-modal Large Language Models? 

**Authors**: Yanbo Wang, Jiyang Guan, Jian Liang, Ran He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10000)  

**Abstract**: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress, yet their safety alignment remains limited. Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.

# Assessing Judging Bias in Large Reasoning Models: An Empirical Study 

**Authors**: Qian Wang, Zhanzhi Lou, Zhenheng Tang, Nuo Chen, Xuandong Zhao, Wenxuan Zhang, Dawn Song, Bingsheng He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09946)  

**Abstract**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-o1 have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, raising important questions about their biases in LLM-as-a-judge settings. We present a comprehensive benchmark comparing judging biases between LLMs and LRMs across both subjective preference-alignment datasets and objective fact-based datasets. Through investigation of bandwagon, authority, position, and distraction biases, we uncover four key findings: (1) despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, LRMs remain susceptible to the above biases; (2) LRMs demonstrate better robustness than LLMs specifically on fact-related datasets; (3) LRMs exhibit notable position bias, preferring options in later positions; and (4) we identify a novel "superficial reflection bias" where phrases mimicking reasoning (e.g., "wait, let me think...") significantly influence model judgments. To address these biases, we design and evaluate three mitigation strategies: specialized system prompts that reduce judging biases by up to 19\% in preference alignment datasets and 14\% in fact-related datasets, in-context learning that provides up to 27\% improvement on preference tasks but shows inconsistent results on factual tasks, and a self-reflection mechanism that reduces biases by up to 10\% in preference datasets and 16\% in fact-related datasets, with self-reflection proving particularly effective for LRMs. Our work provides crucial insights for developing more reliable LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, especially as LRMs become increasingly deployed as automated judges.

# KeepKV: Eliminating Output Perturbation in KV Cache Compression for Efficient LLMs Inference 

**Authors**: Yuxuan Tian, Zihan Wang, Yebo Peng, Aomufei Yuan, Zhiming Wang, Bairen Yi, Xin Liu, Yong Cui, Tong Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09936)  

**Abstract**: Efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) is hindered by an ever-growing key-value (KV) cache, making KV cache compression a critical research direction. Traditional methods selectively evict less important KV cache entries based on attention scores or position heuristics, which leads to information loss and hallucinations. Recently, merging-based strategies have been explored to retain more information by merging KV pairs that would be discarded; however, these existing approaches inevitably introduce inconsistencies in attention distributions before and after merging, causing output perturbation and degraded generation quality. To overcome this challenge, we propose KeepKV, a novel adaptive KV cache merging method designed to eliminate output perturbation while preserving performance under strict memory constraints. KeepKV introduces the Electoral Votes mechanism that records merging history and adaptively adjusts attention scores. Moreover, it further leverages a novel Zero Inference-Perturbation Merging methods, keeping attention consistency and compensating for attention loss resulting from cache merging. KeepKV successfully retains essential context information within a significantly compressed cache. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLM architectures demonstrate that KeepKV substantially reduces memory usage, enhances inference throughput by more than 2x and keeps superior generation quality even with 10% KV cache budgets.

# Reasoning Models Can Be Effective Without Thinking 

**Authors**: Wenjie Ma, Jingxuan He, Charlie Snell, Tyler Griggs, Sewon Min, Matei Zaharia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09858)  

**Abstract**: Recent LLMs have significantly improved reasoning capabilities, primarily by including an explicit, lengthy Thinking process as part of generation. In this paper, we question whether this explicit thinking is necessary. Using the state-of-the-art DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen, we find that bypassing the thinking process via simple prompting, denoted as NoThinking, can be surprisingly effective. When controlling for the number of tokens, NoThinking outperforms Thinking across a diverse set of seven challenging reasoning datasets--including mathematical problem solving, formal theorem proving, and coding--especially in low-budget settings, e.g., 51.3 vs. 28.9 on ACM 23 with 700 tokens. Notably, the performance of NoThinking becomes more competitive with pass@k as k increases. Building on this observation, we demonstrate that a parallel scaling approach that uses NoThinking to generate N outputs independently and aggregates them is highly effective. For aggregation, we use task-specific verifiers when available, or we apply simple best-of-N strategies such as confidence-based selection. Our method outperforms a range of baselines with similar latency using Thinking, and is comparable to Thinking with significantly longer latency (up to 9x). Together, our research encourages a reconsideration of the necessity of lengthy thinking processes, while also establishing a competitive reference for achieving strong reasoning performance in low-budget settings or at low latency using parallel scaling.

# A Survey of Large Language Model-Powered Spatial Intelligence Across Scales: Advances in Embodied Agents, Smart Cities, and Earth Science 

**Authors**: Jie Feng, Jinwei Zeng, Qingyue Long, Hongyi Chen, Jie Zhao, Yanxin Xi, Zhilun Zhou, Yuan Yuan, Shengyuan Wang, Qingbin Zeng, Songwei Li, Yunke Zhang, Yuming Lin, Tong Li, Jingtao Ding, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09848)  

**Abstract**: Over the past year, the development of large language models (LLMs) has brought spatial intelligence into focus, with much attention on vision-based embodied intelligence. However, spatial intelligence spans a broader range of disciplines and scales, from navigation and urban planning to remote sensing and earth science. What are the differences and connections between spatial intelligence across these fields? In this paper, we first review human spatial cognition and its implications for spatial intelligence in LLMs. We then examine spatial memory, knowledge representations, and abstract reasoning in LLMs, highlighting their roles and connections. Finally, we analyze spatial intelligence across scales -- from embodied to urban and global levels -- following a framework that progresses from spatial memory and understanding to spatial reasoning and intelligence. Through this survey, we aim to provide insights into interdisciplinary spatial intelligence research and inspire future studies.

# Augmented Relevance Datasets with Fine-Tuned Small LLMs 

**Authors**: Quentin Fitte-Rey, Matyas Amrouche, Romain Deveaud  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09816)  

**Abstract**: Building high-quality datasets and labeling query-document relevance are essential yet resource-intensive tasks, requiring detailed guidelines and substantial effort from human annotators. This paper explores the use of small, fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to automate relevance assessment, with a focus on improving ranking models' performance by augmenting their training dataset. We fine-tuned small LLMs to enhance relevance assessments, thereby improving dataset creation quality for downstream ranking model training. Our experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned small LLMs not only outperform certain closed source models on our dataset but also lead to substantial improvements in ranking model performance. These results highlight the potential of leveraging small LLMs for efficient and scalable dataset augmentation, providing a practical solution for search engine optimization.

# Can LLM feedback enhance review quality? A randomized study of 20K reviews at ICLR 2025 

**Authors**: Nitya Thakkar, Mert Yuksekgonul, Jake Silberg, Animesh Garg, Nanyun Peng, Fei Sha, Rose Yu, Carl Vondrick, James Zou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09737)  

**Abstract**: Peer review at AI conferences is stressed by rapidly rising submission volumes, leading to deteriorating review quality and increased author dissatisfaction. To address these issues, we developed Review Feedback Agent, a system leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to improve review clarity and actionability by providing automated feedback on vague comments, content misunderstandings, and unprofessional remarks to reviewers. Implemented at ICLR 2025 as a large randomized control study, our system provided optional feedback to more than 20,000 randomly selected reviews. To ensure high-quality feedback for reviewers at this scale, we also developed a suite of automated reliability tests powered by LLMs that acted as guardrails to ensure feedback quality, with feedback only being sent to reviewers if it passed all the tests. The results show that 27% of reviewers who received feedback updated their reviews, and over 12,000 feedback suggestions from the agent were incorporated by those reviewers. This suggests that many reviewers found the AI-generated feedback sufficiently helpful to merit updating their reviews. Incorporating AI feedback led to significantly longer reviews (an average increase of 80 words among those who updated after receiving feedback) and more informative reviews, as evaluated by blinded researchers. Moreover, reviewers who were selected to receive AI feedback were also more engaged during paper rebuttals, as seen in longer author-reviewer discussions. This work demonstrates that carefully designed LLM-generated review feedback can enhance peer review quality by making reviews more specific and actionable while increasing engagement between reviewers and authors. The Review Feedback Agent is publicly available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Dakuo Wang, Ting-Yao Hsu, Yuxuan Lu, Limeng Cui, Yaochen Xie, William Headean, Bingsheng Yao, Akash Veeragouni, Jiapeng Liu, Sreyashi Nag, Jessie Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09723)  

**Abstract**: A/B testing experiment is a widely adopted method for evaluating UI/UX design decisions in modern web applications. Yet, traditional A/B testing remains constrained by its dependence on the large-scale and live traffic of human participants, and the long time of waiting for the testing result. Through formative interviews with six experienced industry practitioners, we identified critical bottlenecks in current A/B testing workflows. In response, we present AgentA/B, a novel system that leverages Large Language Model-based autonomous agents (LLM Agents) to automatically simulate user interaction behaviors with real webpages. AgentA/B enables scalable deployment of LLM agents with diverse personas, each capable of navigating the dynamic webpage and interactively executing multi-step interactions like search, clicking, filtering, and purchasing. In a demonstrative controlled experiment, we employ AgentA/B to simulate a between-subject A/B testing with 1,000 LLM agents this http URL, and compare agent behaviors with real human shopping behaviors at a scale. Our findings suggest AgentA/B can emulate human-like behavior patterns.

# DUMP: Automated Distribution-Level Curriculum Learning for RL-based LLM Post-training 

**Authors**: Zhenting Wang, Guofeng Cui, Kun Wan, Wentian Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09710)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training have led to notable improvements in large language models (LLMs), particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities to handle complex tasks. However, most existing methods treat the training data as a unified whole, overlooking the fact that modern LLM training often involves a mixture of data from diverse distributions-varying in both source and difficulty. This heterogeneity introduces a key challenge: how to adaptively schedule training across distributions to optimize learning efficiency. In this paper, we present a principled curriculum learning framework grounded in the notion of distribution-level learnability. Our core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from further training on a given distribution. Based on this, we propose a distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training, which leverages the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) principle to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities for different distrubutions. This approach prioritizes distributions with either high average advantage (exploitation) or low sample count (exploration), yielding an adaptive and theoretically grounded training schedule. We instantiate our curriculum learning framework with GRPO as the underlying RL algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on logic reasoning datasets with multiple difficulties and sources. Our experiments show that our framework significantly improves convergence speed and final performance, highlighting the value of distribution-aware curriculum strategies in LLM post-training.

# EmoAgent: Assessing and Safeguarding Human-AI Interaction for Mental Health Safety 

**Authors**: Jiahao Qiu, Yinghui He, Xinzhe Juan, Yiming Wang, Yuhan Liu, Zixin Yao, Yue Wu, Xun Jiang, Ling Yang, Mengdi Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09689)  

**Abstract**: The rise of LLM-driven AI characters raises safety concerns, particularly for vulnerable human users with psychological disorders. To address these risks, we propose EmoAgent, a multi-agent AI framework designed to evaluate and mitigate mental health hazards in human-AI interactions. EmoAgent comprises two components: EmoEval simulates virtual users, including those portraying mentally vulnerable individuals, to assess mental health changes before and after interactions with AI characters. It uses clinically proven psychological and psychiatric assessment tools (PHQ-9, PDI, PANSS) to evaluate mental risks induced by LLM. EmoGuard serves as an intermediary, monitoring users' mental status, predicting potential harm, and providing corrective feedback to mitigate risks. Experiments conducted in popular character-based chatbots show that emotionally engaging dialogues can lead to psychological deterioration in vulnerable users, with mental state deterioration in more than 34.4% of the simulations. EmoGuard significantly reduces these deterioration rates, underscoring its role in ensuring safer AI-human interactions. Our code is available at: this https URL

# Fine-tuning an Large Language Model for Automating Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations 

**Authors**: Zhehao Dong, Zhen Lu, Yue Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09602)  

**Abstract**: Configuring computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations typically demands extensive domain expertise, limiting broader access. Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced scientific computing, their use in automating CFD workflows is underdeveloped. We introduce a novel approach centered on domain-specific LLM adaptation. By fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on NL2FOAM, our custom dataset of 28716 natural language-to-OpenFOAM configuration pairs with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, we enable direct translation from natural language descriptions to executable CFD setups. A multi-agent framework orchestrates the process, autonomously verifying inputs, generating configurations, running simulations, and correcting errors. Evaluation on a benchmark of 21 diverse flow cases demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 88.7% solution accuracy and 82.6% first-attempt success rate. This significantly outperforms larger general-purpose models like Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama3.3-70B-Instruct, while also requiring fewer correction iterations and maintaining high computational efficiency. The results highlight the critical role of domain-specific adaptation in deploying LLM assistants for complex engineering workflows.

# Reduction of Supervision for Biomedical Knowledge Discovery 

**Authors**: Christos Theodoropoulos, Andrei Catalin Coman, James Henderson, Marie-Francine Moens  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09582)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge discovery is hindered by the increasing volume of publications and the scarcity of extensive annotated data. To tackle the challenge of information overload, it is essential to employ automated methods for knowledge extraction and processing. Finding the right balance between the level of supervision and the effectiveness of models poses a significant challenge. While supervised techniques generally result in better performance, they have the major drawback of demanding labeled data. This requirement is labor-intensive and time-consuming and hinders scalability when exploring new domains. In this context, our study addresses the challenge of identifying semantic relationships between biomedical entities (e.g., diseases, proteins) in unstructured text while minimizing dependency on supervision. We introduce a suite of unsupervised algorithms based on dependency trees and attention mechanisms and employ a range of pointwise binary classification methods. Transitioning from weakly supervised to fully unsupervised settings, we assess the methods' ability to learn from data with noisy labels. The evaluation on biomedical benchmark datasets explores the effectiveness of the methods. Our approach tackles a central issue in knowledge discovery: balancing performance with minimal supervision. By gradually decreasing supervision, we assess the robustness of pointwise binary classification techniques in handling noisy labels, revealing their capability to shift from weakly supervised to entirely unsupervised scenarios. Comprehensive benchmarking offers insights into the effectiveness of these techniques, suggesting an encouraging direction toward adaptable knowledge discovery systems, representing progress in creating data-efficient methodologies for extracting useful insights when annotated data is limited.

# Draw with Thought: Unleashing Multimodal Reasoning for Scientific Diagram Generation 

**Authors**: Zhiqing Cui, Jiahao Yuan, Hanqing Wang, Yanshu Li, Chenxu Du, Zhenglong Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09479)  

**Abstract**: Scientific diagrams are vital tools for communicating structured knowledge across disciplines. However, they are often published as static raster images, losing symbolic semantics and limiting reuse. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a pathway to bridging vision and structure, existing methods lack semantic control and structural interpretability, especially on complex diagrams. We propose Draw with Thought (DwT), a training-free framework that guides MLLMs to reconstruct diagrams into editable mxGraph XML code through cognitively-grounded Chain-of-Thought reasoning. DwT enables interpretable and controllable outputs without model fine-tuning by dividing the task into two stages: Coarse-to-Fine Planning, which handles perceptual structuring and semantic specification, and Structure-Aware Code Generation, enhanced by format-guided refinement. To support evaluation, we release Plot2XML, a benchmark of 247 real-world scientific diagrams with gold-standard XML annotations. Extensive experiments across eight MLLMs show that our approach yields high-fidelity, semantically aligned, and structurally valid reconstructions, with human evaluations confirming strong alignment in both accuracy and visual aesthetics, offering a scalable solution for converting static visuals into executable representations and advancing machine understanding of scientific graphics.

# AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender 

**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Jiahe Guo, Yulin Hu, Yang Deng, An Zhang, Xingyu Sui, Xinyang Han, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Tat-Seng Chua, Ting Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09466)  

**Abstract**: Despite extensive efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs.

# BabyVLM: Data-Efficient Pretraining of VLMs Inspired by Infant Learning 

**Authors**: Shengao Wang, Arjun Chandra, Aoming Liu, Venkatesh Saligrama, Boqing Gong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09426)  

**Abstract**: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

# REMEMBER: Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning in Zero- and Few-shot Neurodegenerative Diagnosis 

**Authors**: Duy-Cat Can, Quang-Huy Tang, Huong Ha, Binh T. Nguyen, Oliver Y. Chén  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09354)  

**Abstract**: Timely and accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, is central to disease management. Existing deep learning models require large-scale annotated datasets and often function as "black boxes". Additionally, datasets in clinical practice are frequently small or unlabeled, restricting the full potential of deep learning methods. Here, we introduce REMEMBER -- Retrieval-based Explainable Multimodal Evidence-guided Modeling for Brain Evaluation and Reasoning -- a new machine learning framework that facilitates zero- and few-shot Alzheimer's diagnosis using brain MRI scans through a reference-based reasoning process. Specifically, REMEMBER first trains a contrastively aligned vision-text model using expert-annotated reference data and extends pseudo-text modalities that encode abnormality types, diagnosis labels, and composite clinical descriptions. Then, at inference time, REMEMBER retrieves similar, human-validated cases from a curated dataset and integrates their contextual information through a dedicated evidence encoding module and attention-based inference head. Such an evidence-guided design enables REMEMBER to imitate real-world clinical decision-making process by grounding predictions in retrieved imaging and textual context. Specifically, REMEMBER outputs diagnostic predictions alongside an interpretable report, including reference images and explanations aligned with clinical workflows. Experimental results demonstrate that REMEMBER achieves robust zero- and few-shot performance and offers a powerful and explainable framework to neuroimaging-based diagnosis in the real world, especially under limited data.

# Linguistic Comparison of AI- and Human-Written Responses to Online Mental Health Queries 

**Authors**: Koustuv Saha, Yoshee Jain, Munmun De Choudhury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09271)  

**Abstract**: The ubiquity and widespread use of digital and online technologies have transformed mental health support, with online mental health communities (OMHCs) providing safe spaces for peer support. More recently, generative AI and large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for scalable, around-the-clock mental health assistance that could potentially augment and supplement the capabilities of OMHCs. Although genAI shows promise in delivering immediate and personalized responses, their effectiveness in replicating the nuanced, experience-based support of human peers remains an open question. In this study, we harnessed 24,114 posts and 138,758 online community (OC) responses from 55 OMHCs on Reddit. We prompted several state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3, and Mistral-7B) with these posts, and compared their (AI) responses to human-written (OC) responses based on a variety of linguistic measures across psycholinguistics and lexico-semantics. Our findings revealed that AI responses are more verbose, readable, and analytically structured, but lack linguistic diversity and personal narratives inherent in human-human interactions. Through a qualitative examination, we found validation as well as complementary insights into the nature of AI responses, such as its neutrality of stance and the absence of seeking back-and-forth clarifications. We discuss the ethical and practical implications of integrating generative AI into OMHCs, advocating for frameworks that balance AI's scalability and timeliness with the irreplaceable authenticity, social interactiveness, and expertise of human connections that form the ethos of online support communities.

# Mixture of Group Experts for Learning Invariant Representations 

**Authors**: Lei Kang, Jia Li, Mi Tian, Hua Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09265)  

**Abstract**: Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models effectively increase the number of parameters while maintaining consistent computational costs per token. However, vanilla MoE models often suffer from limited diversity and specialization among experts, constraining their performance and scalability, especially as the number of experts increases. In this paper, we present a novel perspective on vanilla MoE with top-$k$ routing inspired by sparse representation. This allows us to bridge established theoretical insights from sparse representation into MoE models. Building on this foundation, we propose a group sparse regularization approach for the input of top-$k$ routing, termed Mixture of Group Experts (MoGE). MoGE indirectly regularizes experts by imposing structural constraints on the routing inputs, while preserving the original MoE architecture. Furthermore, we organize the routing input into a 2D topographic map, spatially grouping neighboring elements. This structure enables MoGE to capture representations invariant to minor transformations, thereby significantly enhancing expert diversity and specialization. Comprehensive evaluations across various Transformer models for image classification and language modeling tasks demonstrate that MoGE substantially outperforms its MoE counterpart, with minimal additional memory and computation overhead. Our approach provides a simple yet effective solution to scale the number of experts and reduce redundancy among them. The source code is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.

**Authors**: Sohom Ghosh, Arnab Maji, Sudip Kumar Naskar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09257)  

**Abstract**: Predicting stock market prices following corporate earnings calls remains a significant challenge for investors and researchers alike, requiring innovative approaches that can process diverse information sources. This study investigates the impact of corporate earnings calls on stock prices by introducing a multi-modal predictive model. We leverage textual data from earnings call transcripts, along with images and tables from accompanying presentations, to forecast stock price movements on the trading day immediately following these calls. To facilitate this research, we developed the MiMIC (Multi-Modal Indian Earnings Calls) dataset, encompassing companies representing the Nifty 50, Nifty MidCap 50, and Nifty Small 50 indices. The dataset includes earnings call transcripts, presentations, fundamentals, technical indicators, and subsequent stock prices. We present a multimodal analytical framework that integrates quantitative variables with predictive signals derived from textual and visual modalities, thereby enabling a holistic approach to feature representation and analysis. This multi-modal approach demonstrates the potential for integrating diverse information sources to enhance financial forecasting accuracy. To promote further research in computational economics, we have made the MiMIC dataset publicly available under the CC-NC-SA-4.0 licence. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature on market reactions to corporate communications and highlights the efficacy of multi-modal machine learning techniques in financial analysis.

**Authors**: Chengyu Wang, Taolin Zhang, Richang Hong, Jun Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09100)  

**Abstract**: Recently, the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, have seen significant advancements through the slow thinking process. Despite these achievements, the substantial computational demands of LRMs present considerable challenges. In contrast, small reasoning models (SRMs), often distilled from larger ones, offer greater efficiency and can exhibit distinct capabilities and cognitive trajectories compared to LRMs. This work surveys around 170 recently published papers on SRMs for tackling various complex reasoning tasks. We review the current landscape of SRMs and analyze diverse training and inference techniques related to SRMs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review of SRMs for domain-specific applications and discuss possible future research directions. This survey serves as an essential reference for researchers to leverage or develop SRMs for advanced reasoning functionalities with high efficiency.

# SIFT-50M: A Large-Scale Multilingual Dataset for Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Prabhat Pandey, Rupak Vignesh Swaminathan, K V Vijay Girish, Arunasish Sen, Jian Xie, Grant P. Strimel, Andreas Schwarz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09081)  

**Abstract**: We introduce SIFT (Speech Instruction Fine-Tuning), a 50M-example dataset designed for instruction fine-tuning and pre-training of speech-text large language models (LLMs). SIFT-50M is built from publicly available speech corpora, which collectively contain 14K hours of speech, and leverages LLMs along with off-the-shelf expert models. The dataset spans five languages, encompassing a diverse range of speech understanding as well as controllable speech generation instructions. Using SIFT-50M, we train SIFT-LLM, which outperforms existing speech-text LLMs on instruction-following benchmarks while achieving competitive performance on foundational speech tasks. To support further research, we also introduce EvalSIFT, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of speech-text LLMs.

# Towards Stepwise Domain Knowledge-Driven Reasoning Optimization and Reflection Improvement 

**Authors**: Chengyuan Liu, Shihang Wang, Lizhi Qing, Kaisong Song, Junjie Cao, Jun Lin, Ji Zhang, Ang Li, Kun Kuang, Fei Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09058)  

**Abstract**: Recently, stepwise supervision on Chain of Thoughts (CoTs) presents an enhancement on the logical reasoning tasks such as coding and math, with the help of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, its contribution to tasks requiring domain-specific expertise and knowledge remains unexplored. Motivated by the interest, we identify several potential challenges of vanilla MCTS within this context, and propose the framework of Stepwise Domain Knowledge-Driven Reasoning Optimization, employing the MCTS algorithm to develop step-level supervision for problems that require essential comprehension, reasoning, and specialized knowledge. Additionally, we also introduce the Preference Optimization towards Reflection Paths, which iteratively learns self-reflection on the reasoning thoughts from better perspectives. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the advantage of the methodologies. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness on various legal-domain problems. We also report a diverse set of valuable findings, hoping to encourage the enthusiasm to the research of domain-specific LLMs and MCTS.

**Authors**: Zixuan Ke, Fangkai Jiao, Yifei Ming, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Austin Xu, Do Xuan Long, Minzhi Li, Chengwei Qin, Peifeng Wang, Silvio Savarese, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.09037)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

# Large Language Model Empowered Recommendation Meets All-domain Continual Pre-Training 

**Authors**: Haokai Ma, Yunshan Ma, Ruobing Xie, Lei Meng, Jialie Shen, Xingwu Sun, Zhanhui Kang, Tat-Seng Chua  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08949)  

**Abstract**: Recent research efforts have investigated how to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommendation, capitalizing on their semantic comprehension and open-world knowledge for user behavior understanding. These approaches predominantly employ supervised fine-tuning on single-domain user interactions to adapt LLMs for specific recommendation tasks. However, they typically encounter dual challenges: the mismatch between general language representations and domain-specific preference patterns, as well as the limited adaptability to multi-domain recommendation scenarios. To bridge these gaps, we introduce CPRec -- an All-domain Continual Pre-Training framework for Recommendation -- designed to holistically align LLMs with universal user behaviors through the continual pre-training paradigm. Specifically, we first design a unified prompt template and organize users' multi-domain behaviors into domain-specific behavioral sequences and all-domain mixed behavioral sequences that emulate real-world user decision logic. To optimize behavioral knowledge infusion, we devise a Warmup-Stable-Annealing learning rate schedule tailored for the continual pre-training paradigm in recommendation to progressively enhance the LLM's capability in knowledge adaptation from open-world knowledge to universal recommendation tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CPRec, we implement it on a large-scale dataset covering seven domains and conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets from two distinct platforms. Experimental results confirm that our continual pre-training paradigm significantly mitigates the semantic-behavioral discrepancy and achieves state-of-the-art performance in all recommendation scenarios. The source code will be released upon acceptance.

# AgentRewardBench: Evaluating Automatic Evaluations of Web Agent Trajectories 

**Authors**: Xing Han Lù, Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Nicholas Meade, Arkil Patel, Dongchan Shin, Alejandra Zambrano, Karolina Stańczak, Peter Shaw, Christopher J. Pal, Siva Reddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08942)  

**Abstract**: Web agents enable users to perform tasks on web browsers through natural language interaction. Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: this https URL

# Spatial Audio Processing with Large Language Model on Wearable Devices 

**Authors**: Ayushi Mishra, Yang Bai, Priyadarshan Narayanasamy, Nakul Garg, Nirupam Roy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08907)  

**Abstract**: Integrating spatial context into large language models (LLMs) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, particularly in wearable devices. In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.

# AI-University: An LLM-based platform for instructional alignment to scientific classrooms 

**Authors**: Mostafa Faghih Shojaei, Rahul Gulati, Benjamin A. Jasperson, Shangshang Wang, Simone Cimolato, Dangli Cao, Willie Neiswanger, Krishna Garikipati  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08846)  

**Abstract**: We introduce AI University (AI-U), a flexible framework for AI-driven course content delivery that adapts to instructors' teaching styles. At its core, AI-U fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to generate instructor-aligned responses from lecture videos, notes, and textbooks. Using a graduate-level finite-element-method (FEM) course as a case study, we present a scalable pipeline to systematically construct training data, fine-tune an open-source LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and optimize its responses through RAG-based synthesis. Our evaluation - combining cosine similarity, LLM-based assessment, and expert review - demonstrates strong alignment with course materials. We also have developed a prototype web application, available at this https URL, that enhances traceability by linking AI-generated responses to specific sections of the relevant course material and time-stamped instances of the open-access video lectures. Our expert model is found to have greater cosine similarity with a reference on 86% of test cases. An LLM judge also found our expert model to outperform the base Llama 3.2 model approximately four times out of five. AI-U offers a scalable approach to AI-assisted education, paving the way for broader adoption in higher education. Here, our framework has been presented in the setting of a class on FEM - a subject that is central to training PhD and Master students in engineering science. However, this setting is a particular instance of a broader context: fine-tuning LLMs to research content in science.

# Mechanistic Anomaly Detection for "Quirky" Language Models 

**Authors**: David O. Johnston, Arkajyoti Chakraborty, Nora Belrose  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08812)  

**Abstract**: As LLMs grow in capability, the task of supervising LLMs becomes more challenging. Supervision failures can occur if LLMs are sensitive to factors that supervisors are unaware of. We investigate Mechanistic Anomaly Detection (MAD) as a technique to augment supervision of capable models; we use internal model features to identify anomalous training signals so they can be investigated or discarded. We train detectors to flag points from the test environment that differ substantially from the training environment, and experiment with a large variety of detector features and scoring rules to detect anomalies in a set of ``quirky'' language models. We find that detectors can achieve high discrimination on some tasks, but no detector is effective across all models and tasks. MAD techniques may be effective in low-stakes applications, but advances in both detection and evaluation are likely needed if they are to be used in high stakes settings.

# Estimating Item Difficulty Using Large Language Models and Tree-Based Machine Learning Algorithms 

**Authors**: Pooya Razavi, Sonya J. Powers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08804)  

**Abstract**: Estimating item difficulty through field-testing is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. As such, there is strong motivation to develop methods that can predict item difficulty at scale using only the item content. Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier for this goal. The present research examines the feasibility of using an LLM to predict item difficulty for K-5 mathematics and reading assessment items (N = 5170). Two estimation approaches were implemented: (a) a direct estimation method that prompted the LLM to assign a single difficulty rating to each item, and (b) a feature-based strategy where the LLM extracted multiple cognitive and linguistic features, which were then used in ensemble tree-based models (random forests and gradient boosting) to predict difficulty. Overall, direct LLM estimates showed moderate to strong correlations with true item difficulties. However, their accuracy varied by grade level, often performing worse for early grades. In contrast, the feature-based method yielded stronger predictive accuracy, with correlations as high as r = 0.87 and lower error estimates compared to both direct LLM predictions and baseline regressors. These findings highlight the promise of LLMs in streamlining item development and reducing reliance on extensive field testing and underscore the importance of structured feature extraction. We provide a seven-step workflow for testing professionals who would want to implement a similar item difficulty estimation approach with their item pool.

# Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer: A Novel Alternative to Self-Attention 

**Authors**: Andrew Kiruluta, Priscilla Burity, Samantha Williams  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08801)  

**Abstract**: Transformer architectures, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art results across numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks by effectively modeling long-range dependencies. However, the computational complexity of self-attention, scaling quadratically with input sequence length, presents significant challenges for processing very long sequences or operating under resource constraints. This paper introduces the Learnable Multi-Scale Wavelet Transformer (LMWT), a novel architecture that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a learnable multi-scale Haar wavelet transform module. Leveraging the intrinsic multi-resolution properties of wavelets, the LMWT efficiently captures both local details and global context. Crucially, the parameters of the wavelet transform, including scale-specific coefficients, are learned end-to-end during training, allowing the model to adapt its decomposition strategy to the data and task. We present the detailed mathematical formulation of the learnable Haar wavelet module and its integration into the transformer framework, supplemented by an architectural diagram. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a standard machine translation benchmark (WMT16 En-De), comparing the LMWT against a baseline self-attention transformer using metrics like BLEU score, perplexity, and token accuracy. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity, highlighting the linear scaling of our approach, discuss its novelty in the context of related work, and explore the interpretability offered by visualizing the learned Haar coefficients. Our results indicate that the LMWT achieves competitive performance while offering substantial computational advantages, positioning it as a promising and novel alternative for efficient sequence modeling.

**Authors**: Teo Susnjak, Cole Palffy, Tatiana Zimina, Nazgul Altynbekova, Kunal Garg, Leona Gilbert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08777)  

**Abstract**: The scientific discourse surrounding Chronic Lyme Disease (CLD) and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) has evolved over the past twenty-five years into a complex and polarised debate, shaped by shifting research priorities, institutional influences, and competing explanatory models. This study presents the first large-scale, systematic examination of this discourse using an innovative hybrid AI-driven methodology, combining large language models with structured human validation to analyse thousands of scholarly abstracts spanning 25 years. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with expert oversight, we developed a quantitative framework for tracking epistemic shifts in contested medical fields, with applications to other content analysis domains. Our analysis revealed a progressive transition from infection-based models of Lyme disease to immune-mediated explanations for persistent symptoms. This study offers new empirical insights into the structural and epistemic forces shaping Lyme disease research, providing a scalable and replicable methodology for analysing discourse, while underscoring the value of AI-assisted methodologies in social science and medical research.

# Evaluation of the phi-3-mini SLM for identification of texts related to medicine, health, and sports injuries 

**Authors**: Chris Brogly, Saif Rjaibi, Charlotte Liang, Erica Lam, Edward Wang, Adam Levitan, Sarah Paleczny, Michael Cusimano  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08764)  

**Abstract**: Small Language Models (SLMs) have potential to be used for automatically labelling and identifying aspects of text data for medicine/health-related purposes from documents and the web. As their resource requirements are significantly lower than Large Language Models (LLMs), these can be deployed potentially on more types of devices. SLMs often are benchmarked on health/medicine-related tasks, such as MedQA, although performance on these can vary especially depending on the size of the model in terms of number of parameters. Furthermore, these test results may not necessarily reflect real-world performance regarding the automatic labelling or identification of texts in documents and the web. As a result, we compared topic-relatedness scores from Microsofts phi-3-mini-4k-instruct SLM to the topic-relatedness scores from 7 human evaluators on 1144 samples of medical/health-related texts and 1117 samples of sports injury-related texts. These texts were from a larger dataset of about 9 million news headlines, each of which were processed and assigned scores by phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Our sample was selected (filtered) based on 1 (low filtering) or more (high filtering) Boolean conditions on the phi-3 SLM scores. We found low-moderate significant correlations between the scores from the SLM and human evaluators for sports injury texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3413, p < 0.001) and medicine/health texts with high filtering (\r{ho} = 0.3854, p < 0.001), and low significant correlation for medicine/health texts with low filtering (\r{ho} = 0.2255, p < 0.001). There was negligible, insignificant correlation for sports injury-related texts with high filtering (\r{ho} = 0.0318, p = 0.4466).

# WebMap -- Large Language Model-assisted Semantic Link Induction in the Web 

**Authors**: Shiraj Pokharel, Georg P. Roßrucker, Mario M. Kubek  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08763)  

**Abstract**: Carrying out research tasks is only inadequately supported, if not hindered, by current web search engines. This paper therefore proposes functional extensions of WebMap, a semantically induced overlay linking structure on the web to inherently facilitate research activities. These add-ons support the dynamic determination and regrouping of document clusters, the creation of a semantic signpost in the web, and the interactive tracing of topics back to their origins.

# Domain Specific Question to SQL Conversion with Embedded Data Balancing Technique 

**Authors**: Jyothi, T. Satyanarayana Murthy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08753)  

**Abstract**: The rise of deep learning in natural language processing has fostered the creation of text to structured query language models composed of an encoder and a decoder. Researchers have experimented with various intermediate processing like schema linking, table type aware, value extract. To generate accurate SQL results for the user question. However error analysis performed on the failed cases on these systems shows, 29 percentage of the errors would be because the system was unable to understand the values expressed by the user in their question. This challenge affects the generation of accurate SQL queries, especially when dealing with domain-specific terms and specific value conditions, where traditional methods struggle to maintain consistency and precision. To overcome these obstacles, proposed two intermediations like implementing data balancing technique and over sampling domain-specific queries which would refine the model architecture to enhance value recognition and fine tuning the model for domain-specific questions. This proposed solution achieved 10.98 percentage improvement in accuracy of the model performance compared to the state of the art model tested on WikiSQL dataset. to convert the user question accurately to SQL queries. Applying oversampling technique on the domain-specific questions shown a significant improvement as compared with traditional approaches.

# A Survey of Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Lang Mei, Siyu Mo, Zhihan Yang, Chong Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08748)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating multimodal data (text, images, videos) into retrieval and generation processes, overcoming the limitations of text-only Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG improves response accuracy by incorporating external textual knowledge, MRAG extends this framework to include multimodal retrieval and generation, leveraging contextual information from diverse data types. This approach reduces hallucinations and enhances question-answering systems by grounding responses in factual, multimodal knowledge. Recent studies show MRAG outperforms traditional RAG, especially in scenarios requiring both visual and textual understanding. This survey reviews MRAG's essential components, datasets, evaluation methods, and limitations, providing insights into its construction and improvement. It also identifies challenges and future research directions, highlighting MRAG's potential to revolutionize multimodal information retrieval and generation. By offering a comprehensive perspective, this work encourages further exploration into this promising paradigm.

**Abstract**: Personalization with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often fails to capture fine-grained features of authors, making it hard to identify their unique traits. To enrich the RAG context, we propose providing Large Language Models (LLMs) with author-specific features, such as average sentiment polarity and frequently used words, in addition to past samples from the author's profile. We introduce a new feature called Contrastive Examples: documents from other authors are retrieved to help LLM identify what makes an author's style unique in comparison to others. Our experiments show that adding a couple of sentences about the named entities, dependency patterns, and words a person uses frequently significantly improves personalized text generation. Combining features with contrastive examples boosts the performance further, achieving a relative 15% improvement over baseline RAG while outperforming the benchmarks. Our results show the value of fine-grained features for better personalization, while opening a new research dimension for including contrastive examples as a complement with RAG. We release our code publicly.

# ExpertRAG: Efficient RAG with Mixture of Experts -- Optimizing Context Retrieval for Adaptive LLM Responses

**Abstract**: ExpertRAG is a novel theoretical framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to advance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge-intensive language modeling. We propose a dynamic retrieval gating mechanism coupled with expert routing, enabling the model to selectively consult an external knowledge store or rely on specialized internal experts based on the query's needs. The paper lays out the theoretical foundations of ExpertRAG, including a probabilistic formulation that treats retrieval and expert selection as latent decisions, and mathematical justifications for its efficiency in both computation and knowledge utilization. We derive formulae to quantify the expected computational cost savings from selective retrieval and the capacity gains from sparse expert utilization. A comparative analysis positions ExpertRAG against standard RAG (with always-on retrieval) and pure MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, Mixtral) to highlight its unique balance between parametric knowledge and non-parametric retrieval. We also outline an experimental validation strategy, proposing benchmarks and evaluation protocols to test ExpertRAG's performance on factual recall, generalization, and inference efficiency. The proposed framework, although presented theoretically, is supported by insights from prior work in RAG and MoE, and is poised to provide more factual, efficient, and adaptive generation by leveraging the best of both paradigms. In summary, ExpertRAG contributes a new perspective on scaling and augmenting language models, backed by a thorough analysis and a roadmap for empirical validation.

**Abstract**: Can large language models (LLMs) implement computations of psychopathology? An effective approach to the question hinges on addressing two factors. First, for conceptual validity, we require a general and computational account of psychopathology that is applicable to computational entities without biological embodiment or subjective experience. Second, mechanisms underlying LLM behaviors need to be studied for better methodological validity. Thus, we establish a computational-theoretical framework to provide an account of psychopathology applicable to LLMs. To ground the theory for empirical analysis, we also propose a novel mechanistic interpretability method alongside a tailored empirical analytic framework. Based on the frameworks, we conduct experiments demonstrating three key claims: first, that distinct dysfunctional and problematic representational states are implemented in LLMs; second, that their activations can spread and self-sustain to trap LLMs; and third, that dynamic, cyclic structural causal models encoded in the LLMs underpin these patterns. In concert, the empirical results corroborate our hypothesis that network-theoretic computations of psychopathology have already emerged in LLMs. This suggests that certain LLM behaviors mirroring psychopathology may not be a superficial mimicry but a feature of their internal processing. Thus, our work alludes to the possibility of AI systems with psychopathological behaviors in the near future.
