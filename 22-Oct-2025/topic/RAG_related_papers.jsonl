Efficiently selecting informative documents requires balancing a key trade-off: (i) retrieving broadly enough to capture all the relevant material, and (ii) limiting retrieval to avoid excessive noise and computational cost. We formulate query decomposition and document retrieval in an exploitation-exploration setting, where retrieving one document at a time builds a belief about the utility of a given sub-query and informs the decision to continue exploiting or exploring an alternative. We experiment with a variety of bandit learning methods and demonstrate their effectiveness in dynamically selecting the most informative sub-queries. Our main finding is that estimating document relevance using rank information and human judgments yields a 35% gain in document-level precision, 15% increase in {\\alpha}-nDCG, and better performance on the downstream task of long-form generation.'}

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city applications.'}

A promising direction is to enhance large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieved from medical corpora or parametric knowledge stored in model parameters. Existing approaches typically fall into two categories: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds model reasoning on externally retrieved evidence, and Generation-Augmented Generation (GAG), which depends solely on the models internal knowledge to generate contextual documents. However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while GAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to unconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine answer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified retrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external and parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules: Knowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to produce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by retrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively selects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form concise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments on five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5% improvement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the effectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in smart contracts pose serious threats to blockchain security. Currently, traditional detection methods primarily rely on static analysis and formal verification, which can result in high false-positive rates and poor scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently made significant progress in smart contract vulnerability detection. However, they still face challenges such as high inference costs and substantial computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ParaVul, a parallel LLM and retrieval-augmented framework to improve the reliability and accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we first develop Sparse Low-Rank Adaptation (SLoRA) for LLM fine-tuning. SLoRA introduces sparsification by incorporating a sparse matrix into quantized LoRA-based LLMs, thereby reducing computational overhead and resource requirements while enhancing their ability to understand vulnerability-related issues. We then construct a vulnerability contract dataset and develop a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates dense retrieval with Best Matching 25 (BM25), assisting in verifying the results generated by the LLM. Furthermore, we propose a meta-learning model to fuse the outputs of the RAG system and the LLM, thereby generating the final detection results. After completing vulnerability detection, we design chain-of-thought prompts to guide LLMs to generate comprehensive vulnerability detection reports. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of ParaVul, especially in terms of F1 scores, achieving 0.9398 for single-label detection and 0.9330 for multi-label detection.'}

These tool calls often fail for various syntactic and semantic reasons. Some less obvious semantic errors can only be identified and resolved after analyzing the tool's response. To repair these errors, we develop a post-tool execution reflection component that combines large language model (LLM)-based reflection with domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using documents describing both the specific tool being called and troubleshooting documents related to the tool. For this paper, we focus on the use case of the kubectl command line tool to manage Kubernetes, a platform for orchestrating cluster applications. Through a larger empirical study and a smaller manual evaluation, we find that our RAG-based reflection will repair kubectl commands such that they are both more likely to successfully execute (pass rate) for 55% of our models evaluated and 36% more likely to correctly answer the user query on average. We find that troubleshooting documents improve pass rate compared to official documentation by an average of 10%."}

However, the informal nature and linguistic complexity of forum interactions pose significant challenges for automated question answering systems, especially when dealing with non-English languages. We present two comprehensive Italian medical benchmarks: \\textbf{IMB-QA}, containing 782,644 patient-doctor conversations from 77 medical categories, and \\textbf{IMB-MCQA}, comprising 25,862 multiple-choice questions from medical specialty examinations. We demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged to improve the clarity and consistency of medical forum data while retaining their original meaning and conversational style, and compare a variety of LLM architectures on both open and multiple-choice question answering tasks. Our experiments with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and domain-specific fine-tuning reveal that specialized adaptation strategies can outperform larger, general-purpose models in medical question answering tasks. These findings suggest that effective medical AI systems may benefit more from domain expertise and efficient information retrieval than from increased model scale.

Saifuzzaman Rafat', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18355', 'abstract': 'In Bangladesh, many farmers continue to face challenges in accessing timely, expert-level agricultural guidance. This paper presents KrishokBondhu, a voice-enabled, call-centre-integrated advisory platform built on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, designed specifically for Bengali-speaking farmers. The system aggregates authoritative agricultural handbooks, extension manuals, and NGO publications; applies Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and document-parsing pipelines to digitize and structure the content; and indexes this corpus in a vector database for efficient semantic retrieval. Through a simple phone-based interface, farmers can call the system to receive real-time, context-aware advice: speech-to-text converts the Bengali query, the RAG module retrieves relevant content, a large language model (Gemma 3-4B) generates a context-grounded response, and text-to-speech delivers the answer in natural spoken Bengali. In a pilot evaluation, KrishokBondhu produced high-quality responses for 72.7% of diverse agricultural queries covering crop management, disease control, and cultivation practices. Compared to the KisanQRS benchmark, the system achieved a composite score of 4.53 (vs. 3.13) on a 5-point scale, a 44.7% improvement, with especially large gains in contextual richness (+367%) and completeness (+100.4%), while maintaining comparable relevance and technical specificity. Semantic similarity analysis further revealed a strong correlation between retrieved context and answer quality, emphasizing the importance of grounding generative responses in curated documentation. KrishokBondhu demonstrates the feasibility of integrating call-centre accessibility, multilingual voice interaction, and modern RAG techniques to deliver expert-level agricultural guidance to remote Bangladeshi farmers, paving the way toward a fully AI-driven agricultural advisory ecosystem.'}

To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions.

However, optimal adaptation strategies, evaluation methodologies, and performance relative to general-purpose LLMs remain poorly characterized. We investigated these questions in electrocardiography, an important area of cardiovascular medicine, by finetuning open-weight models on domain-specific literature and implementing a multi-layered evaluation framework comparing finetuned models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and Claude Sonnet 3.7 as a representative general-purpose model. Finetuned Llama 3.1 70B achieved superior performance on multiple-choice evaluations and automatic text metrics, ranking second to Claude 3.7 in LLM-as-a-judge assessments. Human expert evaluation favored Claude 3.7 and RAG approaches for complex queries. Finetuned models significantly outperformed their base counterparts across nearly all evaluation modes. Our findings reveal substantial performance heterogeneity across evaluation methodologies, underscoring assessment complexity. Nevertheless, domain-specific adaptation through finetuning and RAG achieves competitive performance with proprietary models, supporting the viability of privacy-preserving, locally deployable clinical solutions.'}
