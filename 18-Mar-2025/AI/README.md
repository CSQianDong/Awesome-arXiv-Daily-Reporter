# Fed-Joint: Joint Modeling of Nonlinear Degradation Signals and Failure Events for Remaining Useful Life Prediction using Federated Learning 

**Authors**: Cheoljoon Jeong, Xubo Yue, Seokhyun Chung  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13404)  

**Abstract**: Many failure mechanisms of machinery are closely related to the behavior of condition monitoring (CM) signals. To achieve a cost-effective preventive maintenance strategy, accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction based on the signals is of paramount importance. However, the CM signals are often recorded at different factories and production lines, with limited amounts of data. Unfortunately, these datasets have rarely been shared between the sites due to data confidentiality and ownership issues, a lack of computing and storage power, and high communication costs associated with data transfer between sites and a data center. Another challenge in real applications is that the CM signals are often not explicitly specified \textit{a priori}, meaning that existing methods, which often usually a parametric form, may not be applicable. To address these challenges, we propose a new prognostic framework for RUL prediction using the joint modeling of nonlinear degradation signals and time-to-failure data within a federated learning scheme. The proposed method constructs a nonparametric degradation model using a federated multi-output Gaussian process and then employs a federated survival model to predict failure times and probabilities for in-service machinery. The superiority of the proposed method over other alternatives is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and a case study using turbofan engine degradation signal data that include run-to-failure events.

# Sightation Counts: Leveraging Sighted User Feedback in Building a BLV-aligned Dataset of Diagram Descriptions 

**Authors**: Wan Ju Kang, Eunki Kim, Na Min An, Sangryul Kim, Haemin Choi, Ki Hoon Kwak, James Thorne  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13369)  

**Abstract**: Often, the needs and visual abilities differ between the annotator group and the end user group. Generating detailed diagram descriptions for blind and low-vision (BLV) users is one such challenging domain. Sighted annotators could describe visuals with ease, but existing studies have shown that direct generations by them are costly, bias-prone, and somewhat lacking by BLV standards. In this study, we ask sighted individuals to assess -- rather than produce -- diagram descriptions generated by vision-language models (VLM) that have been guided with latent supervision via a multi-pass inference. The sighted assessments prove effective and useful to professional educators who are themselves BLV and teach visually impaired learners. We release Sightation, a collection of diagram description datasets spanning 5k diagrams and 137k samples for completion, preference, retrieval, question answering, and reasoning training purposes and demonstrate their fine-tuning potential in various downstream tasks.

# Knowledge-Aware Iterative Retrieval for Multi-Agent Systems 

**Authors**: Seyoung Song  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13275)  

**Abstract**: We introduce a novel large language model (LLM)-driven agent framework, which iteratively refines queries and filters contextual evidence by leveraging dynamically evolving knowledge. A defining feature of the system is its decoupling of external sources from an internal knowledge cache that is progressively updated to guide both query generation and evidence selection. This design mitigates bias-reinforcement loops and enables dynamic, trackable search exploration paths, thereby optimizing the trade-off between exploring diverse information and maintaining accuracy through autonomous agent decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a broad range of open-domain question answering benchmarks, including multi-step tasks that mirror real-world scenarios where integrating information from multiple sources is critical, especially given the vulnerabilities of LLMs that lack explicit reasoning or planning capabilities. The results show that the proposed system not only outperforms single-step baselines regardless of task difficulty but also, compared to conventional iterative retrieval methods, demonstrates pronounced advantages in complex tasks through precise evidence-based reasoning and enhanced efficiency. The proposed system supports both competitive and collaborative sharing of updated context, enabling multi-agent extension. The benefits of multi-agent configurations become especially prominent as task difficulty increases. The number of convergence steps scales with task difficulty, suggesting cost-effective scalability.

# Robust Decision-Making Via Free Energy Minimization 

**Authors**: Allahkaram Shafiei, Hozefa Jesawada, Karl Friston, Giovanni Russo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13223)  

**Abstract**: Despite their groundbreaking performance, state-of-the-art autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training/environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge when deploying agents in the real world. Here, departing from mainstream views seeking robustness through training, we introduce DR-FREE, a free energy model that installs this core property by design. It directly wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms via free energy minimization. By combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a novel resolution engine, DR-FREE returns a policy that is optimal-yet-robust against ambiguity. Moreover, for the first time, it reveals the mechanistic role of ambiguity on optimal decisions and requisite Bayesian belief updating. We evaluate DR-FREE on an experimental testbed involving real rovers navigating an ambiguous environment filled with obstacles. Across all the experiments, DR-FREE enables robots to successfully navigate towards their goal even when, in contrast, standard free energy minimizing agents that do not use DR-FREE fail. In short, DR-FREE can tackle scenarios that elude previous methods: this milestone may inspire both deployment in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for a biologically plausible explanation of how natural agents - with little or no training - survive in capricious environments.

# MAP: Evaluation and Multi-Agent Enhancement of Large Language Models for Inpatient Pathways 

**Authors**: Zhen Chen, Zhihao Peng, Xusheng Liang, Cheng Wang, Peigan Liang, Linsheng Zeng, Minjie Ju, Yixuan Yuan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13205)  

**Abstract**: Inpatient pathways demand complex clinical decision-making based on comprehensive patient information, posing critical challenges for clinicians. Despite advancements in large language models (LLMs) in medical applications, limited research focused on artificial intelligence (AI) inpatient pathways systems, due to the lack of large-scale inpatient datasets. Moreover, existing medical benchmarks typically concentrated on medical question-answering and examinations, ignoring the multifaceted nature of clinical decision-making in inpatient settings. To address these gaps, we first developed the Inpatient Pathway Decision Support (IPDS) benchmark from the MIMIC-IV database, encompassing 51,274 cases across nine triage departments and 17 major disease categories alongside 16 standardized treatment options. Then, we proposed the Multi-Agent Inpatient Pathways (MAP) framework to accomplish inpatient pathways with three clinical agents, including a triage agent managing the patient admission, a diagnosis agent serving as the primary decision maker at the department, and a treatment agent providing treatment plans. Additionally, our MAP framework includes a chief agent overseeing the inpatient pathways to guide and promote these three clinician agents. Extensive experiments showed our MAP improved the diagnosis accuracy by 25.10% compared to the state-of-the-art LLM HuatuoGPT2-13B. It is worth noting that our MAP demonstrated significant clinical compliance, outperforming three board-certified clinicians by 10%-12%, establishing a foundation for inpatient pathways systems.

# A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments 

**Authors**: Corina Catarau-Cotutiu, Esther Mondragon, Eduardo Alonso  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13194)  

**Abstract**: The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.

# Rapfi: Distilling Efficient Neural Network for the Game of Gomoku 

**Authors**: Zhanggen Jin, Haobin Duan, Zhiyang Hang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13178)  

**Abstract**: Games have played a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence, with AI agents using sophisticated techniques to compete. Despite the success of neural network based game AIs, their performance often requires significant computational resources. In this paper, we present Rapfi, an efficient Gomoku agent that outperforms CNN-based agents in limited computation environments. Rapfi leverages a compact neural network with a pattern-based codebook distilled from CNNs, and an incremental update scheme that minimizes computation when input changes are minor. This new network uses computation that is orders of magnitude less to reach a similar accuracy of much larger neural networks such as Resnet. Thanks to our incremental update scheme, depth-first search methods such as the alpha-beta search can be significantly accelerated. With a carefully tuned evaluation and search, Rapfi reached strength surpassing Katagomo, the strongest open-source Gomoku AI based on AlphaZero's algorithm, under limited computational resources where accelerators like GPUs are absent. Rapfi ranked first among 520 Gomoku agents on Botzone and won the championship in GomoCup 2024.

# Collaborative AI Enhances Image Understanding in Materials Science 

**Authors**: Ruoyan Avery Yin, Zhichu Ren, Zongyou Yin, Zhen Zhang, So Yeon Kim, Chia-Wei Hsu, Ju Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13169)  

**Abstract**: The Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientist (CRESt) system empowers researchers to control autonomous laboratories through conversational AI, providing a seamless interface for managing complex experimental workflows. We have enhanced CRESt by integrating a multi-agent collaboration mechanism that utilizes the complementary strengths of the ChatGPT and Gemini models for precise image analysis in materials science. This innovative approach significantly improves the accuracy of experimental outcomes by fostering structured debates between the AI models, which enhances decision-making processes in materials phase analysis. Additionally, to evaluate the generalizability of this approach, we tested it on a quantitative task of counting particles. Here, the collaboration between the AI models also led to improved results, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of this method. By harnessing this dual-AI framework, this approach stands as a pioneering method for enhancing experimental accuracy and efficiency in materials research, with applications extending beyond CRESt to broader scientific experimentation and analysis.

# Are LLMs (Really) Ideological? An IRT-based Analysis and Alignment Tool for Perceived Socio-Economic Bias in LLMs 

**Authors**: Jasmin Wachter, Michael Radloff, Maja Smolej, Katharina Kinder-Kurlanda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13149)  

**Abstract**: We introduce an Item Response Theory (IRT)-based framework to detect and quantify socioeconomic bias in large language models (LLMs) without relying on subjective human judgments. Unlike traditional methods, IRT accounts for item difficulty, improving ideological bias estimation. We fine-tune two LLM families (Meta-LLaMa 3.2-1B-Instruct and Chat- GPT 3.5) to represent distinct ideological positions and introduce a two-stage approach: (1) modeling response avoidance and (2) estimating perceived bias in answered responses. Our results show that off-the-shelf LLMs often avoid ideological engagement rather than exhibit bias, challenging prior claims of partisanship. This empirically validated framework enhances AI alignment research and promotes fairer AI governance.

# Intra-neuronal attention within language models Relationships between activation and semantics 

**Authors**: Michael Pichat, William Pogrund, Paloma Pichat, Armanouche Gasparian, Samuel Demarchi, Corbet Alois Georgeon, Michael Veillet-Guillem  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12992)  

**Abstract**: This study investigates the ability of perceptron-type neurons in language models to perform intra-neuronal attention; that is, to identify different homogeneous categorical segments within the synthetic thought category they encode, based on a segmentation of specific activation zones for the tokens to which they are particularly responsive. The objective of this work is therefore to determine to what extent formal neurons can establish a homomorphic relationship between activation-based and categorical segmentations. The results suggest the existence of such a relationship, albeit tenuous, only at the level of tokens with very high activation levels. This intra-neuronal attention subsequently enables categorical restructuring processes at the level of neurons in the following layer, thereby contributing to the progressive formation of high-level categorical abstractions.

# R1-VL: Learning to Reason with Multimodal Large Language Models via Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization 

**Authors**: Jingyi Zhang, Jiaxing Huang, Huanjin Yao, Shunyu Liu, Xikun Zhang, Shijian Lu, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12937)  

**Abstract**: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

# Verification Learning: Make Unsupervised Neuro-Symbolic System Feasible 

**Authors**: Lin-Han Jia, Wen-Chao Hu, Jie-Jing Shao, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12917)  

**Abstract**: The current Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Learning paradigm suffers from an over-reliance on labeled data. If we completely disregard labels, it leads to less symbol information, a larger solution space, and more shortcuts-issues that current Nesy systems cannot resolve. This paper introduces a novel learning paradigm, Verification Learning (VL), which addresses this challenge by transforming the label-based reasoning process in Nesy into a label-free verification process. VL achieves excellent learning results solely by relying on unlabeled data and a function that verifies whether the current predictions conform to the rules. We formalize this problem as a Constraint Optimization Problem (COP) and propose a Dynamic combinatorial Sorting (DCS) algorithm that accelerates the solution by reducing verification attempts, effectively lowering computational costs to the level of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). To further enhance performance, we introduce a prior alignment method to address potential shortcuts. Our theoretical analysis points out which tasks in Nesy systems can be completed without labels and explains why rules can replace infinite labels, such as in addition, for some tasks, while for others, like Sudoku, the rules have no effect. We validate the proposed framework through several fully unsupervised tasks including addition, sort, match, and chess, each showing significant performance and efficiency improvements.

# Analyzing sequential activity and travel decisions with interpretable deep inverse reinforcement learning 

**Authors**: Yuebing Liang, Shenhao Wang, Jiangbo Yu, Zhan Zhao, Jinhua Zhao, Sandy Pentland  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12761)  

**Abstract**: Travel demand modeling has shifted from aggregated trip-based models to behavior-oriented activity-based models because daily trips are essentially driven by human activities. To analyze the sequential activity-travel decisions, deep inverse reinforcement learning (DIRL) has proven effective in learning the decision mechanisms by approximating a reward function to represent preferences and a policy function to replicate observed behavior using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, most existing research has focused on using DIRL to enhance only prediction accuracy, with limited exploration into interpreting the underlying decision mechanisms guiding sequential decision-making. To address this gap, we introduce an interpretable DIRL framework for analyzing activity-travel decision processes, bridging the gap between data-driven machine learning and theory-driven behavioral models. Our proposed framework adapts an adversarial IRL approach to infer the reward and policy functions of activity-travel behavior. The policy function is interpreted through a surrogate interpretable model based on choice probabilities from the policy function, while the reward function is interpreted by deriving both short-term rewards and long-term returns for various activity-travel patterns. Our analysis of real-world travel survey data reveals promising results in two key areas: (i) behavioral pattern insights from the policy function, highlighting critical factors in decision-making and variations among socio-demographic groups, and (ii) behavioral preference insights from the reward function, indicating the utility individuals gain from specific activity sequences.

# Identifying Cooperative Personalities in Multi-agent Contexts through Personality Steering with Representation Engineering 

**Authors**: Kenneth J. K. Ong, Lye Jia Jun, Hieu Minh "Jord" Nguyen, Seong Hah Cho, Natalia Pérez-Campanero Antolín  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12722)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain autonomous capabilities, their coordination in multi-agent settings becomes increasingly important. However, they often struggle with cooperation, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Inspired by Axelrod's Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) tournaments, we explore how personality traits influence LLM cooperation. Using representation engineering, we steer Big Five traits (e.g., Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) in LLMs and analyze their impact on IPD decision-making. Our results show that higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness improve cooperation but increase susceptibility to exploitation, highlighting both the potential and limitations of personality-based steering for aligning AI agents.

# Can Reasoning Models Reason about Hardware? An Agentic HLS Perspective 

**Authors**: Luca Collini, Andrew Hennessee, Ramesh Karri, Siddharth Garg  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12721)  

**Abstract**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 use enhanced reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Their potential in hardware design, which relies on expert-driven iterative optimization, remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether reasoning LLMs can address challenges in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design space exploration and optimization. During HLS, engineers manually define pragmas/directives to balance performance and resource constraints. We propose an LLM-based optimization agentic framework that automatically restructures code, inserts pragmas, and identifies optimal design points via feedback from HLs tools and access to integer-linear programming (ILP) solvers. Experiments compare reasoning models against conventional LLMs on benchmarks using success rate, efficiency, and design quality (area/latency) metrics, and provide the first-ever glimpse into the CoTs produced by a powerful open-source reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1.

# VeriLA: A Human-Centered Evaluation Framework for Interpretable Verification of LLM Agent Failures 

**Authors**: Yoo Yeon Sung, Hannah Kim, Dan Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12651)  

**Abstract**: AI practitioners increasingly use large language model (LLM) agents in compound AI systems to solve complex reasoning tasks, these agent executions often fail to meet human standards, leading to errors that compromise the system's overall performance. Addressing these failures through human intervention is challenging due to the agents' opaque reasoning processes, misalignment with human expectations, the complexity of agent dependencies, and the high cost of manual inspection. This paper thus introduces a human-centered evaluation framework for Verifying LLM Agent failures (VeriLA), which systematically assesses agent failures to reduce human effort and make these agent failures interpretable to humans. The framework first defines clear expectations of each agent by curating human-designed agent criteria. Then, it develops a human-aligned agent verifier module, trained with human gold standards, to assess each agent's execution output. This approach enables granular evaluation of each agent's performance by revealing failures from a human standard, offering clear guidelines for revision, and reducing human cognitive load. Our case study results show that VeriLA is both interpretable and efficient in helping practitioners interact more effectively with the system. By upholding accountability in human-agent collaboration, VeriLA paves the way for more trustworthy and human-aligned compound AI systems.

# Understanding Driver Cognition and Decision-Making Behaviors in High-Risk Scenarios: A Drift Diffusion Perspective 

**Authors**: Heye Huang, Zheng Li, Hao Cheng, Haoran Wang, Junkai Jiang, Xiaopeng Li, Arkady Zgonnikov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12637)  

**Abstract**: Ensuring safe interactions between autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human drivers in mixed traffic systems remains a major challenge, particularly in complex, high-risk scenarios. This paper presents a cognition-decision framework that integrates individual variability and commonalities in driver behavior to quantify risk cognition and model dynamic decision-making. First, a risk sensitivity model based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution is developed to characterize individual differences in risk cognition. Then, a cognitive decision-making model based on the drift diffusion model (DDM) is introduced to capture common decision-making mechanisms in high-risk environments. The DDM dynamically adjusts decision thresholds by integrating initial bias, drift rate, and boundary parameters, adapting to variations in speed, relative distance, and risk sensitivity to reflect diverse driving styles and risk preferences. By simulating high-risk scenarios with lateral, longitudinal, and multidimensional risk sources in a driving simulator, the proposed model accurately predicts cognitive responses and decision behaviors during emergency maneuvers. Specifically, by incorporating driver-specific risk sensitivity, the model enables dynamic adjustments of key DDM parameters, allowing for personalized decision-making representations in diverse scenarios. Comparative analysis with IDM, Gipps, and MOBIL demonstrates that DDM more precisely captures human cognitive processes and adaptive decision-making in high-risk scenarios. These findings provide a theoretical basis for modeling human driving behavior and offer critical insights for enhancing AV-human interaction in real-world traffic environments.

# Automated Planning for Optimal Data Pipeline Instantiation 

**Authors**: Leonardo Rosa Amado, Adriano Vogel, Dalvan Griebler, Gabriel Paludo Licks, Eric Simon, Felipe Meneguzzi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12626)  

**Abstract**: Data pipeline frameworks provide abstractions for implementing sequences of data-intensive transformation operators, automating the deployment and execution of such transformations in a cluster. Deploying a data pipeline, however, requires computing resources to be allocated in a data center, ideally minimizing the overhead for communicating data and executing operators in the pipeline while considering each operator's execution requirements. In this paper, we model the problem of optimal data pipeline deployment as planning with action costs, where we propose heuristics aiming to minimize total execution time. Experimental results indicate that the heuristics can outperform the baseline deployment and that a heuristic based on connections outperforms other strategies.

# MPBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Process Errors Identification 

**Authors**: Zhaopan Xu, Pengfei Zhou, Jiaxin Ai, Wangbo Zhao, Kai Wang, Xiaojiang Peng, Wenqi Shao, Hongxun Yao, Kaipeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12505)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning is an essential capacity for large language models (LLMs) to address complex tasks, where the identification of process errors is vital for improving this ability. Recently, process-level reward models (PRMs) were proposed to provide step-wise rewards that facilitate reinforcement learning and data production during training and guide LLMs toward correct steps during inference, thereby improving reasoning accuracy. However, existing benchmarks of PRMs are text-based and focus on error detection, neglecting other scenarios like reasoning search. To address this gap, we introduce MPBench, a comprehensive, multi-task, multimodal benchmark designed to systematically assess the effectiveness of PRMs in diverse scenarios. MPBench employs three evaluation paradigms, each targeting a specific role of PRMs in the reasoning process: (1) Step Correctness, which assesses the correctness of each intermediate reasoning step; (2) Answer Aggregation, which aggregates multiple solutions and selects the best one; and (3) Reasoning Process Search, which guides the search for optimal reasoning steps during inference. Through these paradigms, MPBench makes comprehensive evaluations and provides insights into the development of multimodal PRMs.

# A Survey on the Optimization of Large Language Model-based Agents 

**Authors**: Shangheng Du, Jiabao Zhao, Jinxin Shi, Zhentao Xie, Xin Jiang, Yanhong Bai, Liang He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12434)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have been widely adopted in various fields, becoming essential for autonomous decision-making and interactive tasks. However, current work typically relies on prompt design or fine-tuning strategies applied to vanilla LLMs, which often leads to limited effectiveness or suboptimal performance in complex agent-related environments. Although LLM optimization techniques can improve model performance across many general tasks, they lack specialized optimization towards critical agent functionalities such as long-term planning, dynamic environmental interaction, and complex decision-making. Although numerous recent studies have explored various strategies to optimize LLM-based agents for complex agent tasks, a systematic review summarizing and comparing these methods from a holistic perspective is still lacking. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of LLM-based agent optimization approaches, categorizing them into parameter-driven and parameter-free methods. We first focus on parameter-driven optimization, covering fine-tuning-based optimization, reinforcement learning-based optimization, and hybrid strategies, analyzing key aspects such as trajectory data construction, fine-tuning techniques, reward function design, and optimization algorithms. Additionally, we briefly discuss parameter-free strategies that optimize agent behavior through prompt engineering and external knowledge retrieval. Finally, we summarize the datasets and benchmarks used for evaluation and tuning, review key applications of LLM-based agents, and discuss major challenges and promising future directions. Our repository for related references is available at this https URL.

# FedGAI: Federated Style Learning with Cloud-Edge Collaboration for Generative AI in Fashion Design 

**Authors**: Mingzhu Wu, Jianan Jiang, Xinglin Li, Hanhui Deng, Di Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12389)  

**Abstract**: Collaboration can amalgamate diverse ideas, styles, and visual elements, fostering creativity and innovation among different designers. In collaborative design, sketches play a pivotal role as a means of expressing design creativity. However, designers often tend to not openly share these meticulously crafted sketches. This phenomenon of data island in the design area hinders its digital transformation under the third wave of AI. In this paper, we introduce a Federated Generative Artificial Intelligence Clothing system, namely FedGAI, employing federated learning to aid in sketch design. FedGAI is committed to establishing an ecosystem wherein designers can exchange sketch styles among themselves. Through FedGAI, designers can generate sketches that incorporate various designers' styles from their peers, drawing inspiration from collaboration without the need for data disclosure or upload. Extensive performance evaluations indicate that our FedGAI system can produce multi-styled sketches of comparable quality to human-designed ones while significantly enhancing efficiency compared to hand-drawn sketches.

# IPCGRL: Language-Instructed Reinforcement Learning for Procedural Level Generation 

**Authors**: In-Chang Baek, Sung-Hyun Kim, Seo-yung Lee, Dong-Hyun Lee, Kyung-Joong Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12358)  

**Abstract**: Recent research has highlighted the significance of natural language in enhancing the controllability of generative models. While various efforts have been made to leverage natural language for content generation, research on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents utilizing text-based instructions for procedural content generation remains limited. In this paper, we propose IPCGRL, an instruction-based procedural content generation method via reinforcement learning, which incorporates a sentence embedding model. IPCGRL fine-tunes task-specific embedding representations to effectively compress game-level conditions. We evaluate IPCGRL in a two-dimensional level generation task and compare its performance with a general-purpose embedding method. The results indicate that IPCGRL achieves up to a 21.4% improvement in controllability and a 17.2% improvement in generalizability for unseen instructions. Furthermore, the proposed method extends the modality of conditional input, enabling a more flexible and expressive interaction framework for procedural content generation.

# SPIN-Bench: How Well Do LLMs Plan Strategically and Reason Socially? 

**Authors**: Jianzhu Yao, Kevin Wang, Ryan Hsieh, Haisu Zhou, Tianqing Zou, Zerui Cheng, Zhangyang Wang, Pramod Viswanath  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12349)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning and strategic behavior in \emph{social interactions} is a hallmark of intelligence. This form of reasoning is significantly more sophisticated than isolated planning or reasoning tasks in static settings (e.g., math problem solving). In this paper, we present \textit{Strategic Planning, Interaction, and Negotiation} (\textbf{SPIN-Bench}), a new multi-domain evaluation designed to measure the intelligence of \emph{strategic planning} and \emph{social reasoning}. While many existing benchmarks focus on narrow planning or single-agent reasoning, SPIN-Bench combines classical PDDL tasks, competitive board games, cooperative card games, and multi-agent negotiation scenarios in one unified framework. The framework includes both a benchmark as well as an arena to simulate and evaluate the variety of social settings to test reasoning and strategic behavior of AI agents. We formulate the benchmark SPIN-Bench by systematically varying action spaces, state complexity, and the number of interacting agents to simulate a variety of social settings where success depends on not only methodical and step-wise decision making, but also \emph{conceptual inference} of other (adversarial or cooperative) participants. Our experiments reveal that while contemporary LLMs handle \emph{basic fact retrieval} and \emph{short-range planning} reasonably well, they encounter significant performance bottlenecks in tasks requiring \emph{deep multi-hop reasoning} over large state spaces and \emph{socially adept} coordination under uncertainty. We envision SPIN-Bench as a catalyst for future research on robust multi-agent planning, social reasoning, and human--AI teaming.

# A Transformer-based survival model for prediction of all-cause mortality in heart failure patients: a multi-cohort study 

**Authors**: Shishir Rao, Nouman Ahmed, Gholamreza Salimi-Khorshidi, Christopher Yau, Huimin Su, Nathalie Conrad, Folkert W Asselbergs, Mark Woodward, Rod Jackson, John GF Cleland, Kazem Rahimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12317)  

**Abstract**: We developed and validated TRisk, a Transformer-based AI model predicting 36-month mortality in heart failure patients by analysing temporal patient journeys from UK electronic health records (EHR). Our study included 403,534 heart failure patients (ages 40-90) from 1,418 English general practices, with 1,063 practices for model derivation and 355 for external validation. TRisk was compared against the MAGGIC-EHR model across various patient subgroups. With median follow-up of 9 months, TRisk achieved a concordance index of 0.845 (95% confidence interval: [0.841, 0.849]), significantly outperforming MAGGIC-EHR's 0.728 (0.723, 0.733) for predicting 36-month all-cause mortality. TRisk showed more consistent performance across sex, age, and baseline characteristics, suggesting less bias. We successfully adapted TRisk to US hospital data through transfer learning, achieving a C-index of 0.802 (0.789, 0.816) with 21,767 patients. Explainability analyses revealed TRisk captured established risk factors while identifying underappreciated predictors like cancers and hepatic failure that were important across both cohorts. Notably, cancers maintained strong prognostic value even a decade after diagnosis. TRisk demonstrated well-calibrated mortality prediction across both healthcare systems. Our findings highlight the value of tracking longitudinal health profiles and revealed risk factors not included in previous expert-driven models.

**Authors**: Idan Lev-Yehudi, Michael Novitsky, Moran Barenboim, Ron Benchetrit, Vadim Indelman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12181)  

**Abstract**: Solving Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) in continuous state, action and observation spaces is key for autonomous planning in many real-world mobility and robotics applications. Current approaches are mostly sample based, and cannot hope to reach near-optimal solutions in reasonable time. We propose two complementary theoretical contributions. First, we formulate a novel Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS) tree for value estimation, that allows to share value information between sibling action branches. The novel MIS tree supports action updates during search time, such as gradient-based updates. Second, we propose a novel methodology to compute value gradients with online sampling based on transition likelihoods. It is applicable to MDPs, and we extend it to POMDPs via particle beliefs with the application of the propagated belief trick. The gradient estimator is computed in practice using the MIS tree with efficient Monte Carlo sampling. These two parts are combined into a new planning algorithm Action Gradient Monte Carlo Tree Search (AGMCTS). We demonstrate in a simulated environment its applicability, advantages over continuous online POMDP solvers that rely solely on sampling, and we discuss further implications.

# Aristotle's Original Idea: For and Against Logic in the era of AI 

**Authors**: Antonis C. Kakas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12161)  

**Abstract**: Aristotle is generally accepted as the father of logic. The ideas that he raised in his study of logical reasoning carried the development of science over the centuries. Today, in the era of AI, this title of the fatherhood of logic has a renewed significance. Behind it lies his original idea that human reasoning could be studied as a process and that perhaps there exist universal systems of reasoning that underly all human reasoning irrespective of the content of what we are reasoning about. In this article, we look into Aristotle's work on human thought, his work on reasoning itself but also on how it relates to science and human endeavor more generally, from a modern perspective of Artificial Intelligence and ask if this can help enlighten our understanding of AI and Science more generally.

# Automating the loop in traffic incident management on highway 

**Authors**: Matteo Cercola, Nicola Gatti, Pedro Huertas Leyva, Benedetto Carambia, Simone Formentin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12085)  

**Abstract**: Effective traffic incident management is essential for ensuring safety, minimizing congestion, and reducing response times in emergency situations. Traditional highway incident management relies heavily on radio room operators, who must make rapid, informed decisions in high-stakes environments. This paper proposes an innovative solution to support and enhance these decisions by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into a decision-support system for traffic incident management. We introduce two approaches: (1) an LLM + Optimization hybrid that leverages both the flexibility of natural language interaction and the robustness of optimization techniques, and (2) a Full LLM approach that autonomously generates decisions using only LLM capabilities. We tested our solutions using historical event data from Autostrade per l'Italia. Experimental results indicate that while both approaches show promise, the LLM + Optimization solution demonstrates superior reliability, making it particularly suited to critical applications where consistency and accuracy are paramount. This research highlights the potential for LLMs to transform highway incident management by enabling accessible, data-driven decision-making support.

# SagaLLM: Context Management, Validation, and Transaction Guarantees for Multi-Agent LLM Planning 

**Authors**: Edward Y. Chang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11951)  

**Abstract**: Recent LLM-based agent frameworks have demonstrated impressive capabilities in task delegation and workflow orchestration, but face significant challenges in maintaining context awareness and ensuring planning consistency. This paper presents SagaLLM, a structured multi-agent framework that addresses four fundamental limitations in current LLM approaches: inadequate self-validation, context narrowing, lacking transaction properties, and insufficient inter-agent coordination. By implementing specialized context management agents and validation protocols, SagaLLM preserves critical constraints and state information throughout complex planning processes, enabling robust and consistent decision-making even during disruptions. We evaluate our approach using selected problems from the REALM benchmark, focusing on sequential and reactive planning scenarios that challenge both context retention and adaptive reasoning. Our experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs, Claude 3.7, DeepSeek R1, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1, demonstrate that while these models exhibit impressive reasoning capabilities, they struggle with maintaining global constraint awareness during complex planning tasks, particularly when adapting to unexpected changes. In contrast, the distributed cognitive architecture of SagaLLM shows significant improvements in planning consistency, constraint enforcement, and adaptation to disruptions in various scenarios.

# Monitoring Reasoning Models for Misbehavior and the Risks of Promoting Obfuscation 

**Authors**: Bowen Baker, Joost Huizinga, Leo Gao, Zehao Dou, Melody Y. Guan, Aleksander Madry, Wojciech Zaremba, Jakub Pachocki, David Farhi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11926)  

**Abstract**: Mitigating reward hacking--where AI systems misbehave due to flaws or misspecifications in their learning objectives--remains a key challenge in constructing capable and aligned models. We show that we can monitor a frontier reasoning model, such as OpenAI o3-mini, for reward hacking in agentic coding environments by using another LLM that observes the model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. CoT monitoring can be far more effective than monitoring agent actions and outputs alone, and we further found that a LLM weaker than o3-mini, namely GPT-4o, can effectively monitor a stronger model. Because CoT monitors can be effective at detecting exploits, it is natural to ask whether those exploits can be suppressed by incorporating a CoT monitor directly into the agent's training objective. While we show that integrating CoT monitors into the reinforcement learning reward can indeed produce more capable and more aligned agents in the low optimization regime, we find that with too much optimization, agents learn obfuscated reward hacking, hiding their intent within the CoT while still exhibiting a significant rate of reward hacking. Because it is difficult to tell when CoTs have become obfuscated, it may be necessary to pay a monitorability tax by not applying strong optimization pressures directly to the chain-of-thought, ensuring that CoTs remain monitorable and useful for detecting misaligned behavior.

# Counterfactual Realizability 

**Authors**: Arvind Raghavan, Elias Bareinboim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11870)  

**Abstract**: It is commonly believed that, in a real-world environment, samples can only be drawn from observational and interventional distributions, corresponding to Layers 1 and 2 of the Pearl Causal Hierarchy. Layer 3, representing counterfactual distributions, is believed to be inaccessible by definition. However, Bareinboim, Forney, and Pearl (2015) introduced a procedure that allows an agent to sample directly from a counterfactual distribution, leaving open the question of what other counterfactual quantities can be estimated directly via physical experimentation. We resolve this by introducing a formal definition of realizability, the ability to draw samples from a distribution, and then developing a complete algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary counterfactual distribution is realizable given fundamental physical constraints, such as the inability to go back in time and subject the same unit to a different experimental condition. We illustrate the implications of this new framework for counterfactual data collection using motivating examples from causal fairness and causal reinforcement learning. While the baseline approach in these motivating settings typically follows an interventional or observational strategy, we show that a counterfactual strategy provably dominates both.

# Safety Mirage: How Spurious Correlations Undermine VLM Safety Fine-tuning 

**Authors**: Yiwei Chen, Yuguang Yao, Yihua Zhang, Bingquan Shen, Gaowen Liu, Sijia Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11832)  

**Abstract**: Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable strides in generative modeling with multimodal inputs, particularly text and images. However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the "safety mirage" where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address this issue, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under one-word attacks, MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%.

# An Algebraic Approach to Moralisation and Triangulation of Probabilistic Graphical Models 

**Authors**: Antonio Lorenzin, Fabio Zanasi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11820)  

**Abstract**: Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation works in the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as functors between a category of Bayesian networks and one of Markov networks. The two kinds of network (the objects of these categories) are themselves represented as functors, from a `syntax' domain to a `semantics' codomain. Notably, moralisation and triangulation are definable inductively on such syntax, and operate as a form of functor pre-composition. This approach introduces a modular, algebraic perspective in the theory of probabilistic graphical models.

# Visualizing Thought: Conceptual Diagrams Enable Robust Planning in LMMs 

**Authors**: Nasim Borazjanizadeh, Roei Herzig, Eduard Oks, Trevor Darrell, Rogerio Feris, Leonid Karlinsky  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11790)  

**Abstract**: Human reasoning relies on constructing and manipulating mental models-simplified internal representations of situations that we use to understand and solve problems. Conceptual diagrams (for example, sketches drawn by humans to aid reasoning) externalize these mental models, abstracting irrelevant details to efficiently capture relational and spatial information. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) predominantly reason through textual representations, limiting their effectiveness in complex multi-step combinatorial and planning tasks. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot fully automatic framework that enables LMMs to reason through multiple chains of self-generated intermediate conceptual diagrams, significantly enhancing their combinatorial planning capabilities. Our approach does not require any human initialization beyond a natural language description of the task. It integrates both textual and diagrammatic reasoning within an optimized graph-of-thought inference framework, enhanced by beam search and depth-wise backtracking. Evaluated on multiple challenging PDDL planning domains, our method substantially improves GPT-4o's performance (for example, from 35.5% to 90.2% in Blocksworld). On more difficult planning domains with solution depths up to 40, our approach outperforms even the o1-preview reasoning model (for example, over 13% improvement in Parking). These results highlight the value of conceptual diagrams as a complementary reasoning medium in LMMs.

# PUBLICSPEAK: Hearing the Public with a Probabilistic Framework in Local Government 

**Authors**: Tianliang Xu, Eva Maxfield Brown, Dustin Dwyer, Sabina Tomkins  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11743)  

**Abstract**: Local governments around the world are making consequential decisions on behalf of their constituents, and these constituents are responding with requests, advice, and assessments of their officials at public meetings. So many small meetings cannot be covered by traditional newsrooms at scale. We propose PUBLICSPEAK, a probabilistic framework which can utilize meeting structure, domain knowledge, and linguistic information to discover public remarks in local government meetings. We then use our approach to inspect the issues raised by constituents in 7 cities across the United States. We evaluate our approach on a novel dataset of local government meetings and find that PUBLICSPEAK improves over state-of-the-art by 10% on average, and by up to 40%.

# Physics-based simulation ontology: an ontology to support modelling and reuse of data for physics-based simulation 

**Authors**: Hyunmin Cheong, Adrian Butscher  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11723)  

**Abstract**: The current work presents an ontology developed for physics-based simulation in engineering design, called Physics-based Simulation Ontology (PSO). The purpose of the ontology is to assist in modelling the physical phenomenon of interest in a veridical manner, while capturing the necessary and reusable information for physics-based simulation solvers. The development involved extending an existing upper ontology, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), to define lower-level terms of PSO. PSO has two parts: PSO-Physics, which consists of terms and relations used to model physical phenomena based on the perspective of classical mechanics involving partial differential equations, and PSO-Sim, which consists of terms used to represent the information artefacts that are about the physical phenomena modelled with PSO-Physics. The former terms are used to model the physical phenomenon of interest independent of solver-specific interpretations, which can be reused across different solvers, while the latter terms are used to instantiate solver-specific input data. A case study involving two simulation solvers was conducted to demonstrate this capability of PSO. Discussion around the benefits and limitations of using BFO for the current work is also provided, which should be valuable for any future work that extends an existing upper ontology to develop ontologies for engineering applications.

# The Relativity of Causal Knowledge 

**Authors**: Gabriele D'Acunto, Claudio Battiloro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11718)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence reveal the limits of purely predictive systems and call for a shift toward causal and collaborative reasoning. Drawing inspiration from the revolution of Grothendieck in mathematics, we introduce the relativity of causal knowledge, which posits structural causal models (SCMs) are inherently imperfect, subjective representations embedded within networks of relationships. By leveraging category theory, we arrange SCMs into a functor category and show that their observational and interventional probability measures naturally form convex structures. This result allows us to encode non-intervened SCMs with convex spaces of probability measures. Next, using sheaf theory, we construct the network sheaf and cosheaf of causal knowledge. These structures enable the transfer of causal knowledge across the network while incorporating interventional consistency and the perspective of the subjects, ultimately leading to the formal, mathematical definition of relative causal knowledge.

# Toward a method for LLM-enabled Indoor Navigation 

**Authors**: Alberto Coffrini, Mohammad Amin Zadenoori, Paolo Barsocchi, Francesco Furfari, Antonino Crivello, Alessio Ferrari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11702)  

**Abstract**: Indoor navigation presents unique challenges due to complex layouts, lack of GPS signals, and accessibility concerns. Existing solutions often struggle with real-time adaptability and user-specific needs. In this work, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), i.e., ChatGPT, to generate natural, context-aware navigation instructions from indoor map images. We design and evaluate test cases across different real-world environments, analyzing the effectiveness of LLMs in interpreting spatial layouts, handling user constraints, and planning efficient routes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for supporting personalized indoor navigation, with an average of 52% correct indications and a maximum of 62%. The results do not appear to depend on the complexity of the layout or the complexity of the expected path, but rather on the number of points of interest and the abundance of visual information, which negatively affect the performance.

# Exploring Causality for HRI: A Case Study on Robotic Mental Well-being Coaching 

**Authors**: Micol Spitale, Srikar Babu, Serhan Cakmak, Jiaee Cheong, Hatice Gunes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11684)  

**Abstract**: One of the primary goals of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research is to develop robots that can interpret human behavior and adapt their responses accordingly. Adaptive learning models, such as continual and reinforcement learning, play a crucial role in improving robots' ability to interact effectively in real-world settings. However, these models face significant challenges due to the limited availability of real-world data, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and well-being. This data scarcity can hinder a robot's ability to adapt to new situations. To address these challenges, causality provides a structured framework for understanding and modeling the underlying relationships between actions, events, and outcomes. By moving beyond mere pattern recognition, causality enables robots to make more explainable and generalizable decisions. This paper presents an exploratory causality-based analysis through a case study of an adaptive robotic coach delivering positive psychology exercises over four weeks in a workplace setting. The robotic coach autonomously adapts to multimodal human behaviors, such as facial valence and speech duration. By conducting both macro- and micro-level causal analyses, this study aims to gain deeper insights into how adaptability can enhance well-being during interactions. Ultimately, this research seeks to advance our understanding of how causality can help overcome challenges in HRI, particularly in real-world applications.

# An LLM-Based Approach for Insight Generation in Data Analysis 

**Authors**: Alberto Sánchez Pérez, Alaa Boukhary, Paolo Papotti, Luis Castejón Lozano, Adam Elwood  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11664)  

**Abstract**: Generating insightful and actionable information from databases is critical in data analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate textual insights. Given a multi-table database as input, our method leverages LLMs to produce concise, text-based insights that reflect interesting patterns in the tables. Our framework includes a Hypothesis Generator to formulate domain-relevant questions, a Query Agent to answer such questions by generating SQL queries against a database, and a Summarization module to verbalize the insights. The insights are evaluated for both correctness and subjective insightfulness using a hybrid model of human judgment and automated metrics. Experimental results on public and enterprise databases demonstrate that our approach generates more insightful insights than other approaches while maintaining correctness.

# MetaScale: Test-Time Scaling with Evolving Meta-Thoughts 

**Authors**: Qin Liu, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, James Y. Huang, Fei Wang, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13447)  

**Abstract**: One critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) for making complex reasoning is their reliance on matching reasoning patterns from training data, instead of proactively selecting the most appropriate cognitive strategy to solve a given task. Existing approaches impose fixed cognitive structures that enhance performance in specific tasks but lack adaptability across diverse scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce METASCALE, a test-time scaling framework based on meta-thoughts -- adaptive thinking strategies tailored to each task. METASCALE initializes a pool of candidate meta-thoughts, then iteratively selects and evaluates them using a multi-armed bandit algorithm with upper confidence bound selection, guided by a reward model. To further enhance adaptability, a genetic algorithm evolves high-reward meta-thoughts, refining and extending the strategy pool over time. By dynamically proposing and optimizing meta-thoughts at inference time, METASCALE improves both accuracy and generalization across a wide range of tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaScale consistently outperforms standard inference approaches, achieving an 11% performance gain in win rate on Arena-Hard for GPT-4o, surpassing o1-mini by 0.9% under style control. Notably, METASCALE scales more effectively with increasing sampling budgets and produces more structured, expert-level responses.

# Faithfulness of LLM Self-Explanations for Commonsense Tasks: Larger Is Better, and Instruction-Tuning Allows Trade-Offs but Not Pareto Dominance 

**Authors**: Noah Y. Siegel, Nicolas Heess, Maria Perez-Ortiz, Oana-Maria Camburu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13445)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, ensuring that their self-generated explanations are faithful to their internal decision-making process is critical for safety and oversight. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual faithfulness analysis across 62 models from 8 families, encompassing both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants and significantly extending prior studies of counterfactual tests. We introduce phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test, which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test. Our findings reveal clear scaling trends: larger models are consistently more faithful on our metrics. However, when comparing instruction-tuned and human-imitated explanations, we find that observed differences in faithfulness can often be attributed to explanation verbosity, leading to shifts along the true-positive/false-positive Pareto frontier. While instruction-tuning and prompting can influence this trade-off, we find limited evidence that they fundamentally expand the frontier of explanatory faithfulness beyond what is achievable with pretrained models of comparable size. Our analysis highlights the nuanced relationship between instruction-tuning, verbosity, and the faithful representation of model decision processes.

# VideoMind: A Chain-of-LoRA Agent for Long Video Reasoning 

**Authors**: Ye Liu, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Chang Wen Chen, Mike Zheng Shou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13444)  

**Abstract**: Videos, with their unique temporal dimension, demand precise grounded understanding, where answers are directly linked to visual, interpretable evidence. Despite significant breakthroughs in reasoning capabilities within Large Language Models, multi-modal reasoning - especially for videos - remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoMind, a novel video-language agent designed for temporal-grounded video understanding. VideoMind incorporates two key innovations: (i) We identify essential capabilities for video temporal reasoning and develop a role-based agentic workflow, including a planner for coordinating different roles, a grounder for temporal localization, a verifier to assess temporal interval accuracy, and an answerer for question-answering. (ii) To efficiently integrate these diverse roles, we propose a novel Chain-of-LoRA strategy, enabling seamless role-switching via lightweight LoRA adaptors while avoiding the overhead of multiple models, thus balancing efficiency and flexibility. Extensive experiments on 14 public benchmarks demonstrate that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse video understanding tasks, including 3 on grounded video question-answering, 6 on video temporal grounding, and 5 on general video question-answering, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing video agent and long-form temporal reasoning.

# Humanoid Policy ~ Human Policy 

**Authors**: Ri-Zhao Qiu, Shiqi Yang, Xuxin Cheng, Chaitanya Chawla, Jialong Li, Tairan He, Ge Yan, Lars Paulsen, Ge Yang, Sha Yi, Guanya Shi, Xiaolong Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13441)  

**Abstract**: Training manipulation policies for humanoid robots with diverse data enhances their robustness and generalization across tasks and platforms. However, learning solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated data collection which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented dataset (PH2D) that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both generalization and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency. Code and data: this https URL

# Deep Belief Markov Models for POMDP Inference 

**Authors**: Giacomo Arcieri, Konstantinos G. Papakonstantinou, Daniel Straub, Eleni Chatzi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13438)  

**Abstract**: This work introduces a novel deep learning-based architecture, termed the Deep Belief Markov Model (DBMM), which provides efficient, model-formulation agnostic inference in Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problems. The POMDP framework allows for modeling and solving sequential decision-making problems under observation uncertainty. In complex, high-dimensional, partially observable environments, existing methods for inference based on exact computations (e.g., via Bayes' theorem) or sampling algorithms do not scale well. Furthermore, ground truth states may not be available for learning the exact transition dynamics. DBMMs extend deep Markov models into the partially observable decision-making framework and allow efficient belief inference entirely based on available observation data via variational inference methods. By leveraging the potency of neural networks, DBMMs can infer and simulate non-linear relationships in the system dynamics and naturally scale to problems with high dimensionality and discrete or continuous variables. In addition, neural network parameters can be dynamically updated efficiently based on data availability. DBMMs can thus be used to infer a belief variable, thus enabling the derivation of POMDP solutions over the belief space. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methodology by evaluating the capability of model-formulation agnostic inference of DBMMs in benchmark problems that include discrete and continuous variables.

# BlobCtrl: A Unified and Flexible Framework for Element-level Image Generation and Editing 

**Authors**: Yaowei Li, Lingen Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xiaoyu Li, Guangzhi Wang, Hongxiang Li, Xiaodong Cun, Ying Shan, Yuexian Zou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13434)  

**Abstract**: Element-level visual manipulation is essential in digital content creation, but current diffusion-based methods lack the precision and flexibility of traditional tools. In this work, we introduce BlobCtrl, a framework that unifies element-level generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation. By employing blobs as visual primitives, our approach effectively decouples and represents spatial location, semantic content, and identity information, enabling precise element-level manipulation. Our key contributions include: 1) a dual-branch diffusion architecture with hierarchical feature fusion for seamless foreground-background integration; 2) a self-supervised training paradigm with tailored data augmentation and score functions; and 3) controllable dropout strategies to balance fidelity and diversity. To support further research, we introduce BlobData for large-scale training and BlobBench for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that BlobCtrl excels in various element-level manipulation tasks while maintaining computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for precise and flexible visual content creation.

# AugMapNet: Improving Spatial Latent Structure via BEV Grid Augmentation for Enhanced Vectorized Online HD Map Construction 

**Authors**: Thomas Monninger, Md Zafar Anwar, Stanislaw Antol, Steffen Staab, Sihao Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13430)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the infrastructure elements, such as lanes and crosswalks. To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining as straightforward to integrate and as generic as auxiliary supervision. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in vectorized map prediction performance up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement. The code will be released soon.

# xLSTM 7B: A Recurrent LLM for Fast and Efficient Inference 

**Authors**: Maximilian Beck, Korbinian Pöppel, Phillip Lippe, Richard Kurle, Patrick M. Blies, Günter Klambauer, Sebastian Böck, Sepp Hochreiter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13427)  

**Abstract**: Recent breakthroughs in solving reasoning, math and coding problems with Large Language Models (LLMs) have been enabled by investing substantial computation budgets at inference time. Therefore, inference speed is one of the most critical properties of LLM architectures, and there is a growing need for LLMs that are efficient and fast at inference. Recently, LLMs built on the xLSTM architecture have emerged as a powerful alternative to Transformers, offering linear compute scaling with sequence length and constant memory usage, both highly desirable properties for efficient inference. However, such xLSTM-based LLMs have yet to be scaled to larger models and assessed and compared with respect to inference speed and efficiency. In this work, we introduce xLSTM 7B, a 7-billion-parameter LLM that combines xLSTM's architectural benefits with targeted optimizations for fast and efficient inference. Our experiments demonstrate that xLSTM 7B achieves performance on downstream tasks comparable to other similar-sized LLMs, while providing significantly faster inference speeds and greater efficiency compared to Llama- and Mamba-based LLMs. These results establish xLSTM 7B as the fastest and most efficient 7B LLM, offering a solution for tasks that require large amounts of test-time computation. Our work highlights xLSTM's potential as a foundational architecture for methods building on heavy use of LLM inference. Our model weights, model code and training code are open-source.

# Securing Virtual Reality Experiences: Unveiling and Tackling Cybersickness Attacks with Explainable AI 

**Authors**: Ripan Kumar Kundu, Matthew Denton, Genova Mongalo, Prasad Calyam, Khaza Anuarul Hoque  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13419)  

**Abstract**: The synergy between virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning (DL)-based cybersickness detection models, has ushered in unprecedented advancements in immersive experiences by automatically detecting cybersickness severity and adaptively various mitigation techniques, offering a smooth and comfortable VR experience. While this DL-enabled cybersickness detection method provides promising solutions for enhancing user experiences, it also introduces new risks since these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks; a small perturbation of the input data that is visually undetectable to human observers can fool the cybersickness detection model and trigger unexpected mitigation, thus disrupting user immersive experiences (UIX) and even posing safety risks. In this paper, we present a new type of VR attack, i.e., a cybersickness attack, which successfully stops the triggering of cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness detection models and dramatically hinders the UIX. Next, we propose a novel explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-guided cybersickness attack detection framework to detect such attacks in VR to ensure UIX and a comfortable VR experience. We evaluate the proposed attack and the detection framework using two state-of-the-art open-source VR cybersickness datasets: Simulation 2021 and Gameplay dataset. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we implement the attack and the XAI-based detection using a testbed with a custom-built VR roller coaster simulation with an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset and perform a user study. Our study shows that such an attack can dramatically hinder the UIX. However, our proposed XAI-guided cybersickness attack detection can successfully detect cybersickness attacks and trigger the proper mitigation, effectively reducing VR cybersickness.

# FLEX: A Framework for Learning Robot-Agnostic Force-based Skills Involving Sustained Contact Object Manipulation 

**Authors**: Shijie Fang, Wenchang Gao, Shivam Goel, Christopher Thierauf, Matthias Scheutz, Jivko Sinapov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13418)  

**Abstract**: Learning to manipulate objects efficiently, particularly those involving sustained contact (e.g., pushing, sliding) and articulated parts (e.g., drawers, doors), presents significant challenges. Traditional methods, such as robot-centric reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning, and hybrid techniques, require massive training and often struggle to generalize across different objects and robot platforms. We propose a novel framework for learning object-centric manipulation policies in force space, decoupling the robot from the object. By directly applying forces to selected regions of the object, our method simplifies the action space, reduces unnecessary exploration, and decreases simulation overhead. This approach, trained in simulation on a small set of representative objects, captures object dynamics -- such as joint configurations -- allowing policies to generalize effectively to new, unseen objects. Decoupling these policies from robot-specific dynamics enables direct transfer to different robotic platforms (e.g., Kinova, Panda, UR5) without retraining. Our evaluations demonstrate that the method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in training efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, operating in force space enhances policy transferability across diverse robot platforms and object types. We further showcase the applicability of our method in a real-world robotic setting. For supplementary materials and videos, please visit: this https URL

# A Comprehensive Survey on Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision-Making: Scenarios, Approaches, Challenges and Perspectives 

**Authors**: Weiqiang Jin, Hongyang Du, Biao Zhao, Xingwu Tian, Bohang Shi, Guang Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13415)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, intelligent decision-making techniques have gradually surpassed human levels in various human-machine competitions, especially in complex multi-agent cooperative task scenarios. Multi-agent cooperative decision-making involves multiple agents working together to complete established tasks and achieve specific objectives. These techniques are widely applicable in real-world scenarios such as autonomous driving, drone navigation, disaster rescue, and simulated military confrontations. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of the leading simulation environments and platforms used for multi-agent cooperative decision-making. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis for these simulation environments from various perspectives, including task formats, reward allocation, and the underlying technologies employed. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive overview of the mainstream intelligent decision-making approaches, algorithms and models for multi-agent systems (MAS). Theseapproaches can be broadly categorized into five types: rule-based (primarily fuzzy logic), game theory-based, evolutionary algorithms-based, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based, and large language models(LLMs)reasoning-based. Given the significant advantages of MARL andLLMs-baseddecision-making methods over the traditional rule, game theory, and evolutionary algorithms, this paper focuses on these multi-agent methods utilizing MARL and LLMs-based techniques. We provide an in-depth discussion of these approaches, highlighting their methodology taxonomies, advantages, and drawbacks. Further, several prominent research directions in the future and potential challenges of multi-agent cooperative decision-making are also detailed.

# Reward Adaptation Via Q-Manipulation 

**Authors**: Kevin Vora, Yu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13414)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a new solution to reward adaptation (RA), the problem where the learning agent adapts to a target reward function based on one or multiple existing behaviors learned a priori under the same domain dynamics but different reward functions. Learning the target behavior from scratch is possible but often inefficient given the available source behaviors. Our work represents a new approach to RA via the manipulation of Q-functions. Assuming that the target reward function is a known function of the source reward functions, our approach to RA computes bounds of the Q function. We introduce an iterative process to tighten the bounds, similar to value iteration. This enables action pruning in the target domain before learning even starts. We refer to such a method as Q-Manipulation (Q-M). We formally prove that our pruning strategy does not affect the optimality of the returned policy while empirically show that it improves the sample complexity. Q-M is evaluated in a variety of synthetic and simulation domains to demonstrate its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality.

**Authors**: Dengyun Peng, Yuhang Zhou, Qiguang Chen, Jinhao Liu, Jingjing Chen, Libo Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13413)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse tasks, largely driven by well-designed prompts. However, crafting and selecting such prompts often requires considerable human effort, significantly limiting its scalability. To mitigate this, recent studies have explored automated prompt optimization as a promising solution. Despite these efforts, existing methods still face critical challenges in robustness, efficiency, and generalization. To systematically address these challenges, we first conduct an empirical analysis to identify the limitations of current reflection-based prompt optimization paradigm. Building on these insights, we propose 7 innovative approaches inspired by traditional deep learning paradigms for prompt optimization (DLPO), seamlessly integrating these concepts into text-based gradient optimization. Through these advancements, we progressively tackle the aforementioned challenges and validate our methods through extensive experimentation. We hope our study not only provides valuable guidance for future research but also offers a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in prompt optimization.

**Authors**: Alexander Ku, Declan Campbell, Xuechunzi Bai, Jiayi Geng, Ryan Liu, Raja Marjieh, R. Thomas McCoy, Andrew Nam, Ilia Sucholutsky, Veniamin Veselovsky, Liyi Zhang, Jian-Qiao Zhu, Thomas L. Griffiths  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13401)  

**Abstract**: Modern artificial intelligence systems, such as large language models, are increasingly powerful but also increasingly hard to understand. Recognizing this problem as analogous to the historical difficulties in understanding the human mind, we argue that methods developed in cognitive science can be useful for understanding large language models. We propose a framework for applying these methods based on Marr's three levels of analysis. By revisiting established cognitive science techniques relevant to each level and illustrating their potential to yield insights into the behavior and internal organization of large language models, we aim to provide a toolkit for making sense of these new kinds of minds.

# MicroVQA: A Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark for Microscopy-Based Scientific Research 

**Authors**: James Burgess, Jeffrey J Nirschl, Laura Bravo-Sánchez, Alejandro Lozano, Sanket Rajan Gupte, Jesus G. Galaz-Montoya, Yuhui Zhang, Yuchang Su, Disha Bhowmik, Zachary Coman, Sarina M. Hasan, Alexandra Johannesson, William D. Leineweber, Malvika G Nair, Ridhi Yarlagadda, Connor Zuraski, Wah Chiu, Sarah Cohen, Jan N. Hansen, Manuel D Leonetti, Chad Liu, Emma Lundberg, Serena Yeung-Levy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13399)  

**Abstract**: Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

# Scale Efficient Training for Large Datasets 

**Authors**: Qing Zhou, Junyu Gao, Qi Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13385)  

**Abstract**: The rapid growth of dataset scales has been a key driver in advancing deep learning research. However, as dataset scale increases, the training process becomes increasingly inefficient due to the presence of low-value samples, including excessive redundant samples, overly challenging samples, and inefficient easy samples that contribute little to model this http URL address this challenge, we propose Scale Efficient Training (SeTa) for large datasets, a dynamic sample pruning approach that losslessly reduces training time. To remove low-value samples, SeTa first performs random pruning to eliminate redundant samples, then clusters the remaining samples according to their learning difficulty measured by loss. Building upon this clustering, a sliding window strategy is employed to progressively remove both overly challenging and inefficient easy clusters following an easy-to-hard this http URL conduct extensive experiments on large-scale synthetic datasets, including ToCa, SS1M, and ST+MJ, each containing over 3 million this http URL reduces training costs by up to 50\% while maintaining or improving performance, with minimal degradation even at 70\% cost reduction. Furthermore, experiments on various scale real datasets across various backbones (CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas) and diverse tasks (instruction tuning, multi-view stereo, geo-localization, composed image retrieval, referring image segmentation) demonstrate the powerful effectiveness and universality of our approach.

# Cream of the Crop: Harvesting Rich, Scalable and Transferable Multi-Modal Data for Instruction Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Mengyao Lyu, Yan Li, Huasong Zhong, Wenhao Yang, Hui Chen, Jungong Han, Guiguang Ding, Zhenheng Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13383)  

**Abstract**: The hypothesis that pretrained large language models (LLMs) necessitate only minimal supervision during the fine-tuning (SFT) stage (Zhou et al., 2024) has been substantiated by recent advancements in data curation and selection research. However, their stability and generalizability are compromised due to the vulnerability to experimental setups and validation protocols, falling short of surpassing random sampling (Diddee & Ippolito, 2024; Xia et al., 2024b). Built upon LLMs, multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs), combined with the sheer token volume and heightened heterogeneity of data sources, amplify both the significance and complexity of data selection.
To harvest multi-modal instructional data in a robust and efficient manner, we re-define the granularity of the quality metric by decomposing it into 14 vision-language-related capabilities, and introduce multi-modal rich scorers to evaluate the capabilities of each data candidate. To promote diversity, in light of the inherent objective of the alignment stage, we take interaction style as diversity indicator and use a multi-modal rich styler to identify data instruction patterns. In doing so, our multi-modal rich scorers and styler (mmSSR) guarantee that high-scoring information is conveyed to users in diversified forms. Free from embedding-based clustering or greedy sampling, mmSSR efficiently scales to millions of data with varying budget constraints, supports customization for general or specific capability acquisition, and facilitates training-free generalization to new domains for curation. Across 10+ experimental settings, validated by 14 multi-modal benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent improvements over random sampling, baseline strategies and state-of-the-art selection methods, achieving 99.1% of full performance with only 30% of the 2.6M data.

# TimeZero: Temporal Video Grounding with Reasoning-Guided LVLM 

**Authors**: Ye Wang, Boshen Xu, Zihao Yue, Zihan Xiao, Ziheng Wang, Liang Zhang, Dingyi Yang, Wenxuan Wang, Qin Jin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13377)  

**Abstract**: We introduce TimeZero, a reasoning-guided LVLM designed for the temporal video grounding (TVG) task. This task requires precisely localizing relevant video segments within long videos based on a given language query. TimeZero tackles this challenge by extending the inference process, enabling the model to reason about video-language relationships solely through reinforcement learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of TimeZero, we conduct experiments on two benchmarks, where TimeZero achieves state-of-the-art performance on Charades-STA. Code is available at this https URL.

# Mitigating Visual Forgetting via Take-along Visual Conditioning for Multi-modal Long CoT Reasoning 

**Authors**: Hai-Long Sun, Zhun Sun, Houwen Peng, Han-Jia Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13360)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.

# Scalable Runtime Architecture for Data-driven, Hybrid HPC and ML Workflow Applications 

**Authors**: Andre Merzky, Mikhail Titov, Matteo Turilli, Ozgur Kilic, Tianle Wang, Shantenu Jha  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13343)  

**Abstract**: Hybrid workflows combining traditional HPC and novel ML methodologies are transforming scientific computing. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of a scalable runtime system that extends RADICAL-Pilot with service-based execution to support AI-out-HPC workflows. Our runtime system enables distributed ML capabilities, efficient resource management, and seamless HPC/ML coupling across local and remote platforms. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach manages concurrent execution of ML models across local and remote HPC/cloud resources with minimal architectural overheads. This lays the foundation for prototyping three representative data-driven workflow applications and executing them at scale on leadership-class HPC platforms.

# Valid Text-to-SQL Generation with Unification-based DeepStochLog 

**Authors**: Ying Jiao, Luc De Raedt, Giuseppe Marra  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13342)  

**Abstract**: Large language models have been used to translate natural language questions to SQL queries. Without hard constraints on syntax and database schema, they occasionally produce invalid queries that are not executable. These failures limit the usage of these systems in real-life scenarios. We propose a neurosymbolic framework that imposes SQL syntax and schema constraints with unification-based definite clause grammars and thus guarantees the generation of valid queries. Our framework also builds a bi-directional interface to language models to leverage their natural language understanding abilities. The evaluation results on a subset of SQL grammars show that all our output queries are valid. This work is the first step towards extending language models with unification-based grammars. We demonstrate this extension enhances the validity, execution accuracy, and ground truth alignment of the underlying language model by a large margin. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Reliable and Efficient Amortized Model-based Evaluation 

**Authors**: Sang Truong, Yuheng Tu, Percy Liang, Bo Li, Sanmi Koyejo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13335)  

**Abstract**: Comprehensive evaluations of language models (LM) during both development and deployment phases are necessary because these models possess numerous capabilities (e.g., mathematical reasoning, legal support, or medical diagnostic) as well as safety risks (e.g., racial bias, toxicity, or misinformation). The average score across a wide range of benchmarks provides a signal that helps guide the use of these LMs in practice. Currently, holistic evaluations are costly due to the large volume of benchmark questions, making frequent evaluations impractical. A popular attempt to lower the cost is to compute the average score on a subset of the benchmark. This approach, unfortunately, often renders an unreliable measure of LM performance because the average score is often confounded with the difficulty of the questions in the benchmark subset. Item response theory (IRT) was designed to address this challenge, providing a reliable measurement by careful controlling for question difficulty. Unfortunately, question difficulty is expensive to estimate. Facing this challenge, we train a model that predicts question difficulty from its content, enabling a reliable measurement at a fraction of the cost. In addition, we leverage this difficulty predictor to further improve the evaluation efficiency through training a question generator given a difficulty level. This question generator is essential in adaptive testing, where, instead of using a random subset of the benchmark questions, informative questions are adaptively chosen based on the current estimation of LLM performance. Experiments on 22 common natural language benchmarks and 172 LMs show that this approach is more reliable and efficient compared to current common practice.

# LEAVS: An LLM-based Labeler for Abdominal CT Supervision 

**Authors**: Ricardo Bigolin Lanfredi, Yan Zhuang, Mark Finkelstein, Praveen Thoppey Srinivasan Balamuralikrishna, Luke Krembs, Brandon Khoury, Arthi Reddy, Pritam Mukherjee, Neil M. Rofsky, Ronald M. Summers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13330)  

**Abstract**: Extracting structured labels from radiology reports has been employed to create vision models to simultaneously detect several types of abnormalities. However, existing works focus mainly on the chest region. Few works have been investigated on abdominal radiology reports due to more complex anatomy and a wider range of pathologies in the abdomen. We propose LEAVS (Large language model Extractor for Abdominal Vision Supervision). This labeler can annotate the certainty of presence and the urgency of seven types of abnormalities for nine abdominal organs on CT radiology reports. To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate that the abnormality labels contain valuable information for training a single vision model that classifies several organs as normal or abnormal. We release our code and structured annotations for a public CT dataset containing over 1,000 CT volumes.

# RainScaleGAN: a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Rainfall Downscaling 

**Authors**: Marcello Iotti, Paolo Davini, Jost von Hardenberg, Giuseppe Zappa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13316)  

**Abstract**: To this day, accurately simulating local-scale precipitation and reliably reproducing its distribution remains a challenging task. The limited horizontal resolution of Global Climate Models is among the primary factors undermining their skill in this context. The physical mechanisms driving the onset and development of precipitation, especially in extreme events, operate at spatio-temporal scales smaller than those numerically resolved, thus struggling to be captured accurately. In order to circumvent this limitation, several downscaling approaches have been developed over the last decades to address the discrepancy between the spatial resolution of models output and the resolution required by local-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce RainScaleGAN, a conditional deep convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for precipitation downscaling. GANs have been effectively used in image super-resolution, an approach highly relevant for downscaling tasks. RainScaleGAN's capabilities are tested in a perfect-model setup, where the spatial resolution of a precipitation dataset is artificially degraded from 0.25$^{\circ}\times$0.25$^{\circ}$ to 2$^{\circ}\times$2$^\circ$, and RainScaleGAN is used to restore it. The developed model outperforms one of the leading precipitation downscaling method found in the literature. RainScaleGAN not only generates a synthetic dataset featuring plausible high-resolution spatial patterns and intensities, but also produces a precipitation distribution with statistics closely mirroring those of the ground-truth dataset. Given that RainScaleGAN's approach is agnostic with respect to the underlying physics, the method has the potential to be applied to other physical variables such as surface winds or temperature.

# Generative AI for Software Architecture. Applications, Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions 

**Authors**: Matteo Esposito, Xiaozhou Li, Sergio Moreschini, Noman Ahmad, Tomas Cerny, Karthik Vaidhyanathan, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Davide Taibi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13310)  

**Abstract**: Context: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming much of software development, yet its application in software architecture is still in its infancy, and no prior study has systematically addressed the topic. Aim: We aim to systematically synthesize the use, rationale, contexts, usability, and future challenges of GenAI in software architecture. Method: We performed a multivocal literature review (MLR), analyzing peer-reviewed and gray literature, identifying current practices, models, adoption contexts, and reported challenges, extracting themes via open coding. Results: Our review identified significant adoption of GenAI for architectural decision support and architectural reconstruction. OpenAI GPT models are predominantly applied, and there is consistent use of techniques such as few-shot prompting and retrieved-augmented generation (RAG). GenAI has been applied mostly to initial stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), such as Requirements-to-Architecture and Architecture-to-Code. Monolithic and microservice architectures were the dominant targets. However, rigorous testing of GenAI outputs was typically missing from the studies. Among the most frequent challenges are model precision, hallucinations, ethical aspects, privacy issues, lack of architecture-specific datasets, and the absence of sound evaluation frameworks. Conclusions: GenAI shows significant potential in software design, but several challenges remain on its path to greater adoption. Research efforts should target designing general evaluation methodologies, handling ethics and precision, increasing transparency and explainability, and promoting architecture-specific datasets and benchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical possibilities and practical use.

# Integrating AI for Human-Centric Breast Cancer Diagnostics: A Multi-Scale and Multi-View Swin Transformer Framework 

**Authors**: Farnoush Bayatmakou, Reza Taleei, Milad Amir Toutounchian, Arash Mohammadi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13309)  

**Abstract**: Despite advancements in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shown significant promise in development of advanced Deep Learning (DL) architectures for breast cancer diagnosis through mammography. In this context, the paper focuses on the integration of AI within a Human-Centric workflow to enhance breast cancer diagnostics. Key challenges are, however, largely overlooked such as reliance on detailed tumor annotations and susceptibility to missing views, particularly during test time. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid, multi-scale and multi-view Swin Transformer-based framework (MSMV-Swin) that enhances diagnostic robustness and accuracy. The proposed MSMV-Swin framework is designed to work as a decision-support tool, helping radiologists analyze multi-view mammograms more effectively. More specifically, the MSMV-Swin framework leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to isolate the breast lobe, reducing background noise and enabling comprehensive feature extraction. The multi-scale nature of the proposed MSMV-Swin framework accounts for tumor-specific regions as well as the spatial characteristics of tissues surrounding the tumor, capturing both localized and contextual information. The integration of contextual and localized data ensures that MSMV-Swin's outputs align with the way radiologists interpret mammograms, fostering better human-AI interaction and trust. A hybrid fusion structure is then designed to ensure robustness against missing views, a common occurrence in clinical practice when only a single mammogram view is available.

# Computation Mechanism Behind LLM Position Generalization 

**Authors**: Chi Han, Heng Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13305)  

**Abstract**: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.

# A Survey on Transformer Context Extension: Approaches and Evaluation 

**Authors**: Yijun Liu, Jinzheng Yu, Yang Xu, Zhongyang Li, Qingfu Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13299)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) based on Transformer have been widely applied in the filed of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating strong performance, particularly in handling short text tasks. However, when it comes to long context scenarios, the performance of LLMs degrades due to some challenges. To alleviate this phenomenon, there is a number of work proposed recently. In this survey, we first list the challenges of applying pre-trained LLMs to process long contexts. Then systematically review the approaches related to long context and propose our taxonomy categorizing them into four main types: positional encoding, context compression, retrieval augmented, and attention pattern. In addition to the approaches, we focus on the evaluation of long context, organizing relevant data, tasks, and metrics based on existing long context benchmarks. Finally, we summarize unresolved issues in the long context domain and put forward our views on future developments.

# $ϕ$-Decoding: Adaptive Foresight Sampling for Balanced Inference-Time Exploration and Exploitation 

**Authors**: Fangzhi Xu, Hang Yan, Chang Ma, Haiteng Zhao, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Zhiyong Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13288)  

**Abstract**: Inference-time optimization scales computation to derive deliberate reasoning steps for effective performance. While previous search-based strategies address the short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named $\phi$-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, $\phi$-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks show $\phi$-Decoding outperforms strong baselines in both performance and efficiency. Additional analysis demonstrates its generalization across various LLMs and scalability across a wide range of computing budgets. The code will be released at this https URL, and the open-source PyPI package is coming soon.

# LLM-Match: An Open-Sourced Patient Matching Model Based on Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Xiaodi Li, Shaika Chowdhury, Chung Il Wi, Maria Vassilaki, Ken Liu, Terence T Sio, Owen Garrick, Young J Juhn, James R Cerhan, Cui Tao, Nansu Zong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13281)  

**Abstract**: Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets, n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022, using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.

# Goal2Story: A Multi-Agent Fleet based on Privately Enabled sLLMs for Impacting Mapping on Requirements Elicitation 

**Authors**: Xinkai Zou, Yan Liu, Xiongbo Shi, Chen Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13279)  

**Abstract**: As requirements drift with rapid iterations, agile development becomes the dominant paradigm. Goal-driven Requirements Elicitation (RE) is a pivotal yet challenging task in agile project development due to its heavy tangling with adaptive planning and efficient collaboration. Recently, AI agents have shown promising ability in supporting requirements analysis by saving significant time and effort for stakeholders. However, current research mainly focuses on functional RE, and research works have not been reported bridging the long journey from goal to user stories. Moreover, considering the cost of LLM facilities and the need for data and idea protection, privately hosted small-sized LLM should be further utilized in RE. To address these challenges, we propose Goal2Story, a multi-agent fleet that adopts the Impact Mapping (IM) framework while merely using cost-effective sLLMs for goal-driven RE. Moreover, we introduce a StorySeek dataset that contains over 1,000 user stories (USs) with corresponding goals and project context information, as well as the semi-automatic dataset construction method. For evaluation, we proposed two metrics: Factuality Hit Rate (FHR) to measure consistency between the generated USs with the dataset and Quality And Consistency Evaluation (QuACE) to evaluate the quality of the generated USs. Experimental results demonstrate that Goal2Story outperforms the baseline performance of the Super-Agent adopting powerful LLMs, while also showcasing the performance improvements in key metrics brought by CoT and Agent Profile to Goal2Story, as well as its exploration in identifying latent needs.

**Authors**: Alfred Simbun, Suresh Kumar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13277)  

**Abstract**: Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems, emphasizing the need for AI-driven tools to assist in rapid and accurate patient prognosis. Chest X-ray imaging is a widely available diagnostic tool, but existing methods for prognosis classification lack scalability and efficiency. Objective: This study presents a high-accuracy deep learning model for classifying COVID-19 severity (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) using Chest X-ray images, developed on Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. Methods: Using a dataset of 1,103 confirmed COVID-19 X-ray images from AIforCOVID, we trained and validated a deep learning model leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was evaluated on an unseen dataset to measure accuracy, precision, and recall. Results: Our model achieved an average accuracy of 97%, with specificity of 99%, sensitivity of 87%, and an F1-score of 93.11%. When classifying COVID-19 severity, the model achieved accuracies of 89.03% (Mild), 95.77% (Moderate), and 81.16% (Severe). These results demonstrate the model's potential for real-world clinical applications, aiding in faster decision-making and improved resource allocation. Conclusion: AI-driven prognosis classification using deep learning can significantly enhance COVID-19 patient management, enabling early intervention and efficient triaging. Our study provides a scalable, high-accuracy AI framework for integrating deep learning into routine clinical workflows. Future work should focus on expanding datasets, external validation, and regulatory compliance to facilitate clinical adoption.

# Can Language Models Follow Multiple Turns of Entangled Instructions? 

**Authors**: Chi Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13222)  

**Abstract**: Despite significant achievements in improving the instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the ability to process multiple potentially entangled or conflicting instructions remains a considerable challenge. Real-world scenarios often require consistency across multiple instructions over time, such as secret privacy, personal preferences, and prioritization, which demand sophisticated abilities to integrate multiple turns and carefully balance competing objectives when instructions intersect or conflict. This work presents a systematic investigation of LLMs' capabilities in handling multiple turns of instructions, covering three levels of difficulty: (1) retrieving information from instructions, (2) tracking and reasoning across turns, and (3) resolving conflicts among instructions. We construct MultiTurnInstruct with around 1.1K high-quality multi-turn conversations through the human-in-the-loop approach and result in nine capability categories, including statics and dynamics, reasoning, and multitasking. Our finding reveals an intriguing trade-off between different capabilities. While GPT models demonstrate superior memorization, they show reduced effectiveness in privacy-protection tasks requiring selective information withholding. Larger models exhibit stronger reasoning capabilities but still struggle with resolving conflicting instructions. Importantly, these performance gaps cannot be attributed solely to information loss, as models demonstrate strong BLEU scores on memorization tasks but their attention mechanisms fail to integrate multiple related instructions effectively. These findings highlight critical areas for improvement in complex real-world tasks involving multi-turn instructions.

# A General Adaptive Dual-level Weighting Mechanism for Remote Sensing Pansharpening 

**Authors**: Jie Huang, Haorui Chen, Jiaxuan Ren, Siran Peng, Liangjian Deng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13214)  

**Abstract**: Currently, deep learning-based methods for remote sensing pansharpening have advanced rapidly. However, many existing methods struggle to fully leverage feature heterogeneity and redundancy, thereby limiting their effectiveness. We use the covariance matrix to model the feature heterogeneity and redundancy and propose Correlation-Aware Covariance Weighting (CACW) to adjust them. CACW captures these correlations through the covariance matrix, which is then processed by a nonlinear function to generate weights for adjustment. Building upon CACW, we introduce a general adaptive dual-level weighting mechanism (ADWM) to address these challenges from two key perspectives, enhancing a wide range of existing deep-learning methods. First, Intra-Feature Weighting (IFW) evaluates correlations among channels within each feature to reduce redundancy and enhance unique information. Second, Cross-Feature Weighting (CFW) adjusts contributions across layers based on inter-layer correlations, refining the final output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ADWM compared to recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through generality experiments, redundancy visualization, comparison experiments, key variables and complexity analysis, and ablation studies. Our code is available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Marvin Seyfarth, Salman Ul Hassan Dar, Isabelle Ayx, Matthias Alexander Fink, Stefan O. Schoenberg, Hans-Ulrich Kauczor, Sandy Engelhardt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13211)  

**Abstract**: Advancements in AI for medical imaging offer significant potential. However, their applications are constrained by the limited availability of data and the reluctance of medical centers to share it due to patient privacy concerns. Generative models present a promising solution by creating synthetic data as a substitute for real patient data. However, medical images are typically high-dimensional, and current state-of-the-art methods are often impractical for computational resource-constrained healthcare environments. These models rely on data sub-sampling, raising doubts about their feasibility and real-world applicability. Furthermore, many of these models are evaluated on quantitative metrics that alone can be misleading in assessing the image quality and clinical meaningfulness of the generated images. To address this, we introduce MedLoRD, a generative diffusion model designed for computational resource-constrained environments. MedLoRD is capable of generating high-dimensional medical volumes with resolutions up to 512$\times$512$\times$256, utilizing GPUs with only 24GB VRAM, which are commonly found in standard desktop workstations. MedLoRD is evaluated across multiple modalities, including Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography and Lung Computed Tomography datasets. Extensive evaluations through radiological evaluation, relative regional volume analysis, adherence to conditional masks, and downstream tasks show that MedLoRD generates high-fidelity images closely adhering to segmentation mask conditions, surpassing the capabilities of current state-of-the-art generative models for medical image synthesis in computational resource-constrained environments.

# Improving Complex Reasoning with Dynamic Prompt Corruption: A soft prompt Optimization Approach 

**Authors**: Sinan Fan, Liang Xie, Chen Shen, Ge Teng, Xiaosong Yuan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Chenxi Huang, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He, Jieping Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13208)  

**Abstract**: Prompt-tuning (PT) for large language models (LLMs) can facilitate the performance on various conventional NLP tasks with significantly fewer trainable parameters. However, our investigation reveals that PT provides limited improvement and may even degrade the primitive performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks. Such a phenomenon suggests that soft prompts can positively impact certain instances while negatively affecting others, particularly during the later phases of reasoning. To address these challenges, We first identify an information accumulation within the soft prompts. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is often accompanied by erroneous information flow patterns in the deeper layers of the model, which ultimately lead to incorrect reasoning outcomes. we propose a novel method called \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{C}orruption (DPC) to take better advantage of soft prompts in complex reasoning tasks, which dynamically adjusts the influence of soft prompts based on their impact on the reasoning process. Specifically, DPC consists of two stages: Dynamic Trigger and Dynamic Corruption. First, Dynamic Trigger measures the impact of soft prompts, identifying whether beneficial or detrimental. Then, Dynamic Corruption mitigates the negative effects of soft prompts by selectively masking key tokens that interfere with the reasoning process. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on various LLMs and reasoning tasks, including GSM8K, MATH, and AQuA. Experimental results demonstrate that DPC can consistently enhance the performance of PT, achieving 4\%-8\% accuracy gains compared to vanilla prompt tuning, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach and its potential to enhance complex reasoning in LLMs.

# Timing the Match: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Ride-Hailing and Ride-Pooling Services 

**Authors**: Yiman Bao, Jie Gao, Jinke He, Frans A. Oliehoek, Oded Cats  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13200)  

**Abstract**: Efficient timing in ride-matching is crucial for improving the performance of ride-hailing and ride-pooling services, as it determines the number of drivers and passengers considered in each matching process. Traditional batched matching methods often use fixed time intervals to accumulate ride requests before assigning matches. While this approach increases the number of available drivers and passengers for matching, it fails to adapt to real-time supply-demand fluctuations, often leading to longer passenger wait times and driver idle periods. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptive ride-matching strategy using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically determine when to perform matches based on real-time system conditions. Unlike fixed-interval approaches, our method continuously evaluates system states and executes matching at moments that minimize total passenger wait time. Additionally, we incorporate a potential-based reward shaping (PBRS) mechanism to mitigate sparse rewards, accelerating RL training and improving decision quality. Extensive empirical evaluations using a realistic simulator trained on real-world data demonstrate that our approach outperforms fixed-interval matching strategies, significantly reducing passenger waiting times and detour delays, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of ride-hailing and ride-pooling systems.

# 3DAxisPrompt: Promoting the 3D Grounding and Reasoning in GPT-4o 

**Authors**: Dingning Liu, Cheng Wang, Peng Gao, Renrui Zhang, Xinzhu Ma, Yuan Meng, Zhihui Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13185)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities across a variety of tasks, especially when equipped with carefully designed visual prompts. However, existing studies primarily focus on logical reasoning and visual understanding, while the capability of MLLMs to operate effectively in 3D vision remains an ongoing area of exploration. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual prompting method, called 3DAxisPrompt, to elicit the 3D understanding capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenes. More specifically, our method leverages the 3D coordinate axis and masks generated from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide explicit geometric priors to MLLMs and then extend their impressive 2D grounding and reasoning ability to real-world 3D scenarios. Besides, we first provide a thorough investigation of the potential visual prompting formats and conclude our findings to reveal the potential and limits of 3D understanding capabilities in GPT-4o, as a representative of MLLMs. Finally, we build evaluation environments with four datasets, i.e., ScanRefer, ScanNet, FMB, and nuScene datasets, covering various 3D tasks. Based on this, we conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, our study reveals that MLLMs, with the help of 3DAxisPrompt, can effectively perceive an object's 3D position in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, a single prompt engineering approach does not consistently achieve the best outcomes for all 3D tasks. This study highlights the feasibility of leveraging MLLMs for 3D vision grounding/reasoning with prompt engineering techniques.

# GC-Fed: Gradient Centralized Federated Learning with Partial Client Participation 

**Authors**: Jungwon Seo, Ferhat Ozgur Catak, Chunming Rong, Kibeom Hong, Minhoe Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13180)  

**Abstract**: Multi-source information fusion (MSIF) leverages diverse data streams to enhance decision-making, situational awareness, and system resilience. Federated Learning (FL) enables MSIF while preserving privacy but suffers from client drift under high data heterogeneity, leading to performance degradation. Traditional mitigation strategies rely on reference-based gradient adjustments, which can be unstable in partial participation settings. To address this, we propose Gradient Centralized Federated Learning (GC-Fed), a reference-free gradient correction method inspired by Gradient Centralization (GC). We introduce Local GC and Global GC, applying GC during local training and global aggregation, respectively. Our hybrid GC-Fed approach selectively applies GC at the feature extraction layer locally and at the classifier layer globally, improving training stability and model performance. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that GC-Fed mitigates client drift and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy gains of up to 20% in heterogeneous settings.

# HybridGen: VLM-Guided Hybrid Planning for Scalable Data Generation of Imitation Learning 

**Authors**: Wensheng Wang, Ning Tan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13171)  

**Abstract**: The acquisition of large-scale and diverse demonstration data are essential for improving robotic imitation learning generalization. However, generating such data for complex manipulations is challenging in real-world settings. We introduce HybridGen, an automated framework that integrates Vision-Language Model (VLM) and hybrid planning. HybridGen uses a two-stage pipeline: first, VLM to parse expert demonstrations, decomposing tasks into expert-dependent (object-centric pose transformations for precise control) and plannable segments (synthesizing diverse trajectories via path planning); second, pose transformations substantially expand the first-stage data. Crucially, HybridGen generates a large volume of training data without requiring specific data formats, making it broadly applicable to a wide range of imitation learning algorithms, a characteristic which we also demonstrate empirically across multiple algorithms. Evaluations across seven tasks and their variants demonstrate that agents trained with HybridGen achieve substantial performance and generalization gains, averaging a 5% improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, in the most challenging task variants, HybridGen achieves significant improvement, reaching a 59.7% average success rate, significantly outperforming Mimicgen's 49.5%. These results demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality.

# Efficient Imitation Under Misspecification 

**Authors**: Nicolas Espinosa-Dice, Sanjiban Choudhury, Wen Sun, Gokul Swamy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13162)  

**Abstract**: Interactive imitation learning (IL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions from an expert demonstrating how to perform a task. Prior work in efficient imitation learning has focused on the realizable setting, where the expert's policy lies within the learner's policy class (i.e. the learner can perfectly imitate the expert in all states). However, in practice, perfect imitation of the expert is often impossible due to differences in state information and action space expressiveness (e.g. morphological differences between robots and humans.) In this paper, we consider the more general misspecified setting, where no assumptions are made about the expert policy's realizability. We introduce a novel structural condition, reward-agnostic policy completeness, and prove that it is sufficient for interactive IL algorithms to efficiently avoid the quadratically compounding errors that stymie offline approaches like behavioral cloning. We address an additional practical constraint-the case of limited expert data-and propose a principled method for using additional offline data to further improve the sample-efficiency of interactive IL algorithms. Finally, we empirically investigate the optimal reset distribution in efficient IL under misspecification with a suite of continuous control tasks.

# Logic-in-Frames: Dynamic Keyframe Search via Visual Semantic-Logical Verification for Long Video Understanding 

**Authors**: Weiyu Guo, Ziyang Chen, Shaoguang Wang, Jianxiang He, Yijie Xu, Jinhui Ye, Ying Sun, Hui Xiong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13139)  

**Abstract**: Understanding long video content is a complex endeavor that often relies on densely sampled frame captions or end-to-end feature selectors, yet these techniques commonly overlook the logical relationships between textual queries and visual elements. In practice, computational constraints necessitate coarse frame subsampling, a challenge analogous to ``finding a needle in a haystack.'' To address this issue, we introduce a semantics-driven search framework that reformulates keyframe selection under the paradigm of Visual Semantic-Logical Search. Specifically, we systematically define four fundamental logical dependencies: 1) spatial co-occurrence, 2) temporal proximity, 3) attribute dependency, and 4) causal order. These relations dynamically update frame sampling distributions through an iterative refinement process, enabling context-aware identification of semantically critical frames tailored to specific query requirements. Our method establishes new SOTA performance on the manually annotated benchmark in key-frame selection metrics. Furthermore, when applied to downstream video question-answering tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates the best performance gains over existing methods on LongVideoBench and Video-MME, validating its effectiveness in bridging the logical gap between textual queries and visual-temporal reasoning. The code will be publicly available.

# MIXPINN: Mixed-Material Simulations by Physics-Informed Neural Network 

**Authors**: Xintian Yuan, Yunke Ao, Boqi Chen, Philipp Fuernstahl  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13123)  

**Abstract**: Simulating the complex interactions between soft tissues and rigid anatomy is critical for applications in surgical training, planning, and robotic-assisted interventions. Traditional Finite Element Method (FEM)-based simulations, while accurate, are computationally expensive and impractical for real-time scenarios. Learning-based approaches have shown promise in accelerating predictions but have fallen short in modeling soft-rigid interactions effectively. We introduce MIXPINN, a physics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for mixed-material simulations, explicitly capturing soft-rigid interactions using graph-based augmentations. Our approach integrates Virtual Nodes (VNs) and Virtual Edges (VEs) to enhance rigid body constraint satisfaction while preserving computational efficiency. By leveraging a graph-based representation of biomechanical structures, MIXPINN learns high-fidelity deformations from FEM-generated data and achieves real-time inference with sub-millimeter accuracy. We validate our method in a realistic clinical scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline GNN models and traditional FEM methods. Our results show that MIXPINN reduces computational cost by an order of magnitude while maintaining high physical accuracy, making it a viable solution for real-time surgical simulation and robotic-assisted procedures.

# Beyond Propagation of Chaos: A Stochastic Algorithm for Mean Field Optimization 

**Authors**: Chandan Tankala, Dheeraj M. Nagaraj, Anant Raj  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13115)  

**Abstract**: Gradient flow in the 2-Wasserstein space is widely used to optimize functionals over probability distributions and is typically implemented using an interacting particle system with $n$ particles. Analyzing these algorithms requires showing (a) that the finite-particle system converges and/or (b) that the resultant empirical distribution of the particles closely approximates the optimal distribution (i.e., propagation of chaos). However, establishing efficient sufficient conditions can be challenging, as the finite particle system may produce heavily dependent random variables.
In this work, we study the virtual particle stochastic approximation, originally introduced for Stein Variational Gradient Descent. This method can be viewed as a form of stochastic gradient descent in the Wasserstein space and can be implemented efficiently. In popular settings, we demonstrate that our algorithm's output converges to the optimal distribution under conditions similar to those for the infinite particle limit, and it produces i.i.d. samples without the need to explicitly establish propagation of chaos bounds.

# Lifting the Veil on Visual Information Flow in MLLMs: Unlocking Pathways to Faster Inference 

**Authors**: Hao Yin, Guangzong Si, Zilei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13108)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) improve performance on vision-language tasks by integrating visual features from pre-trained vision encoders into large language models (LLMs). However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference.

# ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large language Models 

**Authors**: Hao Yin, Guangzong Si, Zilei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13107)  

**Abstract**: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors, these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs, producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools, it offers both computational efficiency and versatility, making it highly attractive. However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs.

# ClusComp: A Simple Paradigm for Model Compression and Efficient Finetuning 

**Authors**: Baohao Liao, Christian Herold, Seyyed Hadi Hashemi, Stefan Vasilev, Shahram Khadivi, Christof Monz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13089)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) scale, model compression is crucial for edge deployment and accessibility. Weight-only quantization reduces model size but suffers from performance degradation at lower bit widths. Moreover, standard finetuning is incompatible with quantized models, and alternative methods often fall short of full finetuning. In this paper, we propose ClusComp, a simple yet effective compression paradigm that clusters weight matrices into codebooks and finetunes them block-by-block. ClusComp (1) achieves superior performance in 2-4 bit quantization, (2) pushes compression to 1-bit while outperforming ultra-low-bit methods with minimal finetuning, and (3) enables efficient finetuning, even surpassing existing quantization-based approaches and rivaling full FP16 finetuning. Notably, ClusComp supports compression and finetuning of 70B LLMs on a single A6000-48GB GPU.

# Free-form language-based robotic reasoning and grasping 

**Authors**: Runyu Jiao, Alice Fasoli, Francesco Giuliari, Matteo Bortolon, Sergio Povoli, Guofeng Mei, Yiming Wang, Fabio Poiesi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13082)  

**Abstract**: Performing robotic grasping from a cluttered bin based on human instructions is a challenging task, as it requires understanding both the nuances of free-form language and the spatial relationships between objects. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data, such as GPT-4o, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across both text and images. But can they truly be used for this task in a zero-shot setting? And what are their limitations? In this paper, we explore these research questions via the free-form language-based robotic grasping task, and propose a novel method, FreeGrasp, leveraging the pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to reason about human instructions and object spatial arrangements. Our method detects all objects as keypoints and uses these keypoints to annotate marks on images, aiming to facilitate GPT-4o's zero-shot spatial reasoning. This allows our method to determine whether a requested object is directly graspable or if other objects must be grasped and removed first. Since no existing dataset is specifically designed for this task, we introduce a synthetic dataset FreeGraspData by extending the MetaGraspNetV2 dataset with human-annotated instructions and ground-truth grasping sequences. We conduct extensive analyses with both FreeGraspData and real-world validation with a gripper-equipped robotic arm, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution.

# A Framework to Assess Multilingual Vulnerabilities of LLMs 

**Authors**: Likai Tang, Niruth Bogahawatta, Yasod Ginige, Jiarui Xu, Shixuan Sun, Surangika Ranathunga, Suranga Seneviratne  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13081)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are acquiring a wider range of capabilities, including understanding and responding in multiple languages. While they undergo safety training to prevent them from answering illegal questions, imbalances in training data and human evaluation resources can make these models more susceptible to attacks in low-resource languages (LRL). This paper proposes a framework to automatically assess the multilingual vulnerabilities of commonly used LLMs. Using our framework, we evaluated six LLMs across eight languages representing varying levels of resource availability. We validated the assessments generated by our automated framework through human evaluation in two languages, demonstrating that the framework's results align with human judgments in most cases. Our findings reveal vulnerabilities in LRL; however, these may pose minimal risk as they often stem from the model's poor performance, resulting in incoherent responses.

# Mitigating Cross-Modal Distraction and Ensuring Geometric Feasibility via Affordance-Guided, Self-Consistent MLLMs for Food Preparation Task Planning 

**Authors**: Yu-Hong Shen, Chuan-Yu Wu, Yi-Ru Yang, Yen-Ling Tai, Yi-Ting Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13055)  

**Abstract**: We study Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with in-context learning for food preparation task planning. In this context, we identify two key challenges: cross-modal distraction and geometric feasibility. Cross-modal distraction occurs when the inclusion of visual input degrades the reasoning performance of a MLLM. Geometric feasibility refers to the ability of MLLMs to ensure that the selected skills are physically executable in the environment. To address these issues, we adapt Chain of Thought (CoT) with Self-Consistency to mitigate reasoning loss from cross-modal distractions and use affordance predictor as skill preconditions to guide MLLM on geometric feasibility. We construct a dataset to evaluate the ability of MLLMs on quantity estimation, reachability analysis, relative positioning and collision avoidance. We conducted a detailed evaluation to identify issues among different baselines and analyze the reasons for improvement, providing insights into each approach. Our method reaches a success rate of 76.7% on the entire dataset, showing a substantial improvement over the CoT baseline at 36.7%.

# PoseSyn: Synthesizing Diverse 3D Pose Data from In-the-Wild 2D Data 

**Authors**: ChangHee Yang, Hyeonseop Song, Seokhun Choi, Seungwoo Lee, Jaechul Kim, Hoseok Do  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13025)  

**Abstract**: Despite considerable efforts to enhance the generalization of 3D pose estimators without costly 3D annotations, existing data augmentation methods struggle in real world scenarios with diverse human appearances and complex poses. We propose PoseSyn, a novel data synthesis framework that transforms abundant in the wild 2D pose dataset into diverse 3D pose image pairs. PoseSyn comprises two key components: Error Extraction Module (EEM), which identifies challenging poses from the 2D pose datasets, and Motion Synthesis Module (MSM), which synthesizes motion sequences around the challenging poses. Then, by generating realistic 3D training data via a human animation model aligned with challenging poses and appearances PoseSyn boosts the accuracy of various 3D pose estimators by up to 14% across real world benchmarks including various backgrounds and occlusions, challenging poses, and multi view scenarios. Extensive experiments further confirm that PoseSyn is a scalable and effective approach for improving generalization without relying on expensive 3D annotations, regardless of the pose estimator's model size or design.

# Test-Time Domain Generalization via Universe Learning: A Multi-Graph Matching Approach for Medical Image Segmentation 

**Authors**: Xingguo Lv, Xingbo Dong, Liwen Wang, Jiewen Yang, Lei Zhao, Bin Pu, Zhe Jin, Xuejun Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.13012)  

**Abstract**: Despite domain generalization (DG) has significantly addressed the performance degradation of pre-trained models caused by domain shifts, it often falls short in real-world deployment. Test-time adaptation (TTA), which adjusts a learned model using unlabeled test data, presents a promising solution. However, most existing TTA methods struggle to deliver strong performance in medical image segmentation, primarily because they overlook the crucial prior knowledge inherent to medical images. To address this challenge, we incorporate morphological information and propose a framework based on multi-graph matching. Specifically, we introduce learnable universe embeddings that integrate morphological priors during multi-source training, along with novel unsupervised test-time paradigms for domain adaptation. This approach guarantees cycle-consistency in multi-matching while enabling the model to more effectively capture the invariant priors of unseen data, significantly mitigating the effects of domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on two medical image segmentation benchmarks for both multi-source and single-source domain generalization tasks.

# Concept-as-Tree: Synthetic Data is All You Need for VLM Personalization 

**Authors**: Ruichuan An, Kai Zeng, Ming Lu, Sihan Yang, Renrui Zhang, Huitong Ji, Qizhe Zhang, Yulin Luo, Hao Liang, Wentao Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12999)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in various multi-modal tasks. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in improving the personalization capabilities of VLMs. To better integrate user-provided concepts into VLMs, many methods use positive and negative samples to fine-tune these models. However, the scarcity of user-provided positive samples and the low quality of retrieved negative samples pose challenges for fine-tuning. To reveal the relationship between sample and model performance, we systematically investigate the impact of positive and negative samples (easy and hard) and their diversity on VLM personalization tasks. Based on the detailed analysis, we introduce Concept-as-Tree (CaT), which represents a concept as a tree structure, thereby enabling the data generation of positive and negative samples with varying difficulty and diversity for VLM personalization. With a well-designed data filtering strategy, our CaT framework can ensure the quality of generated data, constituting a powerful pipeline. We perform thorough experiments with various VLM personalization baselines to assess the effectiveness of the pipeline, alleviating the lack of positive samples and the low quality of negative samples. Our results demonstrate that CaT equipped with the proposed data filter significantly enhances the personalization capabilities of VLMs across the MyVLM, Yo'LLaVA, and MC-LLaVA datasets. To our knowledge, this work is the first controllable synthetic data pipeline for VLM personalization. The code is released at \href{this https URL}{this https URL}.

# Robot Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations: An Active Reinforcement Learning Approach 

**Authors**: Muhan Hou, Koen Hindriks, A.E. Eiben, Kim Baraka  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12993)  

**Abstract**: Transfer Learning (TL) is a powerful tool that enables robots to transfer learned policies across different environments, tasks, or embodiments. To further facilitate this process, efforts have been made to combine it with Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) for more flexible and efficient policy transfer. However, these approaches are almost exclusively limited to offline demonstrations collected before policy transfer starts, which may suffer from the intrinsic issue of covariance shift brought by LfD and harm the performance of policy transfer. Meanwhile, extensive work in the learning-from-scratch setting has shown that online demonstrations can effectively alleviate covariance shift and lead to better policy performance with improved sample efficiency. This work combines these insights to introduce online demonstrations into a policy transfer setting. We present Policy Transfer with Online Demonstrations, an active LfD algorithm for policy transfer that can optimize the timing and content of queries for online episodic expert demonstrations under a limited demonstration budget. We evaluate our method in eight robotic scenarios, involving policy transfer across diverse environment characteristics, task objectives, and robotic embodiments, with the aim to transfer a trained policy from a source task to a related but different target task. The results show that our method significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of average success rate and sample efficiency, compared to two canonical LfD methods with offline demonstrations and one active LfD method with online demonstrations. Additionally, we conduct preliminary sim-to-real tests of the transferred policy on three transfer scenarios in the real-world environment, demonstrating the policy effectiveness on a real robot manipulator.

# A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Palakorn Achananuparp, Ee-Peng Lim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12989)  

**Abstract**: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show significant improvements in classification accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's adaptability for multi-label skill classification. Our results indicate that the framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, offering a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.

# ROMA: a Read-Only-Memory-based Accelerator for QLoRA-based On-Device LLM 

**Authors**: Wenqiang Wang, Yijia Zhang, Zikai Zhang, Guanting Huo, Hao Liang, Shijie Cao, Ningyi Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12988)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful capabilities, deploying them on edge devices has become increasingly crucial, offering advantages in privacy and real-time interaction. QLoRA has emerged as the standard approach for on-device LLMs, leveraging quantized models to reduce memory and computational costs while utilizing LoRA for task-specific adaptability. In this work, we propose ROMA, a QLoRA accelerator with a hybrid storage architecture that uses ROM for quantized base models and SRAM for LoRA weights and KV cache. Our insight is that the quantized base model is stable and converged, making it well-suited for ROM storage. Meanwhile, LoRA modules offer the flexibility to adapt to new data without requiring updates to the base model. To further reduce the area cost of ROM, we introduce a novel B-ROM design and integrate it with the compute unit to form a fused cell for efficient use of chip resources. ROMA can effectively store both a 4-bit 3B and a 2-bit 8B LLaMA model entirely on-chip, achieving a notable generation speed exceeding 20,000 tokens/s without requiring external memory.

**Authors**: Junming Liu, Siyuan Meng, Yanting Gao, Song Mao, Pinlong Cai, Guohang Yan, Yirong Chen, Zilin Bian, Botian Shi, Ding Wang

**Abstract**: Multimodal reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) struggles with incomplete knowledge and hallucination artifacts, challenges that textual Knowledge Graphs (KGs) only partially mitigate due to their modality isolation. While Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) promise enhanced cross-modal understanding, their practical construction is impeded by semantic narrowness of manual text annotations and inherent noise in visual-semantic entity linkages. In this paper, we propose Vision-align-to-Language integrated Knowledge Graph (VaLiK), a novel approach for constructing MMKGs that enhances LLMs reasoning through cross-modal information supplementation. Specifically, we cascade pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align image features with text, transforming them into descriptions that encapsulate image-specific information. Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models. Our code is published at this https URL.

# Open3DBench: Open-Source Benchmark for 3D-IC Backend Implementation and PPA Evaluation 

**Authors**: Yunqi Shi, Chengrui Gao, Wanqi Ren, Siyuan Xu, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian, Zhi-Hua Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12946)  

**Abstract**: This work introduces Open3DBench, an open-source 3D-IC backend implementation benchmark built upon the OpenROAD-flow-scripts framework, enabling comprehensive evaluation of power, performance, area, and thermal metrics. Our proposed flow supports modular integration of 3D partitioning, placement, 3D routing, RC extraction, and thermal simulation, aligning with advanced 3D flows that rely on commercial tools and in-house scripts. We present two foundational 3D placement algorithms: Open3D-Tiling, which emphasizes regular macro placement, and Open3D-DMP, which enhances wirelength optimization through cross-die co-placement with analytical placer DREAMPlace. Experimental results show significant improvements in area (51.19%), wirelength (24.06%), timing (30.84%), and power (5.72%) compared to 2D flows. The results also highlight that better wirelength does not necessarily lead to PPA gain, emphasizing the need of developing PPA-driven methods. Open3DBench offers a standardized, reproducible platform for evaluating 3D EDA methods, effectively bridging the gap between open-source tools and commercial solutions in 3D-IC design.

# MirrorGuard: Adaptive Defense Against Jailbreaks via Entropy-Guided Mirror Crafting 

**Authors**: Rui Pu, Chaozhuo Li, Rui Ha, Litian Zhang, Lirong Qiu, Xi Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12931)  

**Abstract**: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is crucial for ensuring their safe deployment. Existing defense strategies generally rely on predefined static criteria to differentiate between harmful and benign prompts. However, such rigid rules are incapable of accommodating the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of real jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel concept of ``mirror'' to enable dynamic and adaptive defense. A mirror refers to a dynamically generated prompt that mirrors the syntactic structure of the input while ensuring semantic safety. The personalized discrepancies between the input prompts and their corresponding mirrors serve as the guiding principles for defense. A new defense paradigm, MirrorGuard, is further proposed to detect and calibrate risky inputs based on such mirrors. An entropy-based detection metric, Relative Input Uncertainty (RIU), is integrated into MirrorGuard to quantify the discrepancies between input prompts and mirrors. MirrorGuard is evaluated on several popular datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art defense performance while maintaining general effectiveness.

# MMLNB: Multi-Modal Learning for Neuroblastoma Subtyping Classification Assisted with Textual Description Generation 

**Authors**: Huangwei Chen, Zhu Zhu, Zhenyu Yan, Yifei Chen, Mingyang Ding, Chenlei Li, Feiwei Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12927)  

**Abstract**: Neuroblastoma (NB), a leading cause of childhood cancer mortality, exhibits significant histopathological variability, necessitating precise subtyping for accurate prognosis and treatment. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective evaluations that are time-consuming and inconsistent. To address these challenges, we introduce MMLNB, a multi-modal learning (MML) model that integrates pathological images with generated textual descriptions to improve classification accuracy and interpretability. The approach follows a two-stage process. First, we fine-tune a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to enhance pathology-aware text generation. Second, the fine-tuned VLM generates textual descriptions, using a dual-branch architecture to independently extract visual and textual features. These features are fused via Progressive Robust Multi-Modal Fusion (PRMF) Block for stable training. Experimental results show that the MMLNB model is more accurate than the single modal model. Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of multi-modal fusion, fine-tuning, and the PRMF mechanism. This research creates a scalable AI-driven framework for digital pathology, enhancing reliability and interpretability in NB subtyping classification.

# HICD: Hallucination-Inducing via Attention Dispersion for Contrastive Decoding to Mitigate Hallucinations in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Xinyan Jiang, Hang Ye, Yongxin Zhu, Xiaoying Zheng, Zikang Chen, Jun Gong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12908)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations, producing outputs that are contextually inaccurate or factually incorrect. We introduce HICD, a novel method designed to induce hallucinations for contrastive decoding to mitigate hallucinations. Unlike existing contrastive decoding methods, HICD selects attention heads crucial to the model's prediction as inducing heads, then induces hallucinations by dispersing attention of these inducing heads and compares the hallucinated outputs with the original outputs to obtain the final result. Our approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring contextual faithfulness, such as context completion, reading comprehension, and question answering. It also improves factuality in tasks requiring accurate knowledge recall. We demonstrate that our inducing heads selection and attention dispersion method leads to more "contrast-effective" hallucinations for contrastive decoding, outperforming other hallucination-inducing methods. Our findings provide a promising strategy for reducing hallucinations by inducing hallucinations in a controlled manner, enhancing the performance of LLMs in a wide range of tasks.

# Federated Continual Instruction Tuning 

**Authors**: Haiyang Guo, Fanhu Zeng, Fei Zhu, Wenzhuo Liu, Da-Han Wang, Jian Xu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12897)  

**Abstract**: A vast amount of instruction tuning data is crucial for the impressive performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but the associated computational costs and data collection demands during supervised fine-tuning make it impractical for most researchers. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to leverage all distributed data and training resources to reduce the overhead of joint training. However, most existing methods assume a fixed number of tasks, while in real-world scenarios, clients continuously encounter new knowledge and often struggle to retain old tasks due to memory constraints. In this work, we introduce the Federated Continual Instruction Tuning (FCIT) benchmark to model this real-world challenge. Our benchmark includes two realistic scenarios, encompassing four different settings and twelve carefully curated instruction tuning datasets. To address the challenges posed by FCIT, we propose dynamic knowledge organization to effectively integrate updates from different tasks during training and subspace selective activation to allocate task-specific output during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance across varying levels of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

# nvBench 2.0: A Benchmark for Natural Language to Visualization under Ambiguity 

**Authors**: Tianqi Luo, Chuhan Huang, Leixian Shen, Boyan Li, Shuyu Shen, Wei Zeng, Nan Tang, Yuyu Luo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12880)  

**Abstract**: Natural Language to Visualization (NL2VIS) enables users to create visualizations from natural language queries, making data insights more accessible. However, NL2VIS faces challenges in interpreting ambiguous queries, as users often express their visualization needs in imprecise language. To address this challenge, we introduce nvBench 2.0, a new benchmark designed to evaluate NL2VIS systems in scenarios involving ambiguous queries. nvBench 2.0 includes 7,878 natural language queries and 24,076 corresponding visualizations, derived from 780 tables across 153 domains. It is built using a controlled ambiguity-injection pipeline that generates ambiguous queries through a reverse-generation workflow. By starting with unambiguous seed visualizations and selectively injecting ambiguities, the pipeline yields multiple valid interpretations for each query, with each ambiguous query traceable to its corresponding visualization through step-wise reasoning paths. We evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to perform ambiguous NL2VIS tasks using nvBench 2.0. We also propose Step-NL2VIS, an LLM-based model trained on nvBench 2.0, which enhances performance in ambiguous scenarios through step-wise preference optimization. Our results show that Step-NL2VIS outperforms all baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art for ambiguous NL2VIS tasks.

# VITED: Video Temporal Evidence Distillation 

**Authors**: Yujie Lu, Yale Song, William Wang, Lorenzo Torresani, Tushar Nagarajan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12855)  

**Abstract**: We investigate complex video question answering via chain-of-evidence reasoning -- identifying sequences of temporal spans from multiple relevant parts of the video, together with visual evidence within them. Existing models struggle with multi-step reasoning as they uniformly sample a fixed number of frames, which can miss critical evidence distributed nonuniformly throughout the video. Moreover, they lack the ability to temporally localize such evidence in the broader context of the full video, which is required for answering complex questions. We propose a framework to enhance existing VideoQA datasets with evidence reasoning chains, automatically constructed by searching for optimal intervals of interest in the video with supporting evidence, that maximizes the likelihood of answering a given question. We train our model (VITED) to generate these evidence chains directly, enabling it to both localize evidence windows as well as perform multi-step reasoning across them in long-form video content. We show the value of our evidence-distilled models on a suite of long video QA benchmarks where we outperform state-of-the-art approaches that lack evidence reasoning capabilities.

# Towards Scalable Foundation Model for Multi-modal and Hyperspectral Geospatial Data 

**Authors**: Haozhe Si, Yuxuan Wan, Minh Do, Deepak Vasisht, Han Zhao, Hendrik F. Hamann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12843)  

**Abstract**: Geospatial raster (imagery) data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer (LESS ViT) with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both spatial and spectral continuity and physical characteristics of each patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct a benchmark, GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models, achieving superior performance with less computation and fewer parameters. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.

# CompMarkGS: Robust Watermarking for Compression 3D Gaussian Splatting 

**Authors**: Sumin In, Youngdong Jang, Utae Jeong, MinHyuk Jang, Hyeongcheol Park, Eunbyung Park, Sangpil Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12836)  

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables rapid differentiable rendering for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, leading to its widespread commercial use. Consequently, copyright protection via watermarking has become critical. However, because 3DGS relies on millions of Gaussians, which require gigabytes of storage, efficient transfer and storage require compression. Existing 3DGS watermarking methods are vulnerable to quantization-based compression, often resulting in the loss of the embedded watermark. To address this challenge, we propose a novel watermarking method that ensures watermark robustness after model compression while maintaining high rendering quality. In detail, we incorporate a quantization distortion layer that simulates compression during training, preserving the watermark under quantization-based compression. Also, we propose a learnable watermark embedding feature that embeds the watermark into the anchor feature, ensuring structural consistency and seamless integration into the 3D scene. Furthermore, we present a frequency-aware anchor growing mechanism to enhance image quality in high-frequency regions by effectively identifying Guassians within these regions. Experimental results confirm that our method preserves the watermark and maintains superior image quality under high compression, validating it as a promising approach for a secure 3DGS model.

# PASTA: Part-Aware Sketch-to-3D Shape Generation with Text-Aligned Prior 

**Authors**: Seunggwan Lee, Hwanhee Jung, Byoungsoo Koh, Qixing Huang, Sangho Yoon, Sangpil Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12834)  

**Abstract**: A fundamental challenge in conditional 3D shape generation is to minimize the information loss and maximize the intention of user input. Existing approaches have predominantly focused on two types of isolated conditional signals, i.e., user sketches and text descriptions, each of which does not offer flexible control of the generated shape. In this paper, we introduce PASTA, the flexible approach that seamlessly integrates a user sketch and a text description for 3D shape generation. The key idea is to use text embeddings from a vision-language model to enrich the semantic representation of sketches. Specifically, these text-derived priors specify the part components of the object, compensating for missing visual cues from ambiguous sketches. In addition, we introduce ISG-Net which employs two types of graph convolutional networks: IndivGCN, which processes fine-grained details, and PartGCN, which aggregates these details into parts and refines the structure of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PASTA outperforms existing methods in part-level editing and achieves state-of-the-art results in sketch-to-3D shape generation.

# SparseLUT: Sparse Connectivity Optimization for Lookup Table-based Deep Neural Networks 

**Authors**: Binglei Lou, Ruilin Wu, Philip Leong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12829)  

**Abstract**: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) requires a careful balance of latency, power, and resource usage while maintaining high accuracy. Existing Lookup Table (LUT)-based DNNs, including LogicNets, PolyLUT, PolyLUT-Add, and NeuraLUT, exploit native FPGA resources with random sparse connectivity. This paper introduces SparseLUT, a connectivity-centric training technique tailored for LUT-based DNNs. SparseLUT leverages a non-greedy training strategy that prioritizes the pruning of less significant connections and strategically regrows alternative ones, resulting in efficient convergence to the target sparsity. Experimental results show consistent accuracy improvements across benchmarks, including up to a 2.13\% increase on MNIST and a 0.94\% improvement for Jet Substructure Classification compared to random sparsity. This is done without any hardware overhead and achieves state-of-the-art results for LUT-based DNNs.

# From Head to Tail: Towards Balanced Representation in Large Vision-Language Models through Adaptive Data Calibration 

**Authors**: Mingyang Song, Xiaoye Qu, Jiawei Zhou, Yu Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12821)  

**Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in combining visual comprehension with language generation. Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\textbf{DR}$) and $\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.

# Versatile Physics-based Character Control with Hybrid Latent Representation 

**Authors**: Jinseok Bae, Jungdam Won, Donggeun Lim, Inwoo Hwang, Young Min Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12814)  

**Abstract**: We present a versatile latent representation that enables physically simulated character to efficiently utilize motion priors. To build a powerful motion embedding that is shared across multiple tasks, the physics controller should employ rich latent space that is easily explored and capable of generating high-quality motion. We propose integrating continuous and discrete latent representations to build a versatile motion prior that can be adapted to a wide range of challenging control tasks. Specifically, we build a discrete latent model to capture distinctive posterior distribution without collapse, and simultaneously augment the sampled vector with the continuous residuals to generate high-quality, smooth motion without jittering. We further incorporate Residual Vector Quantization, which not only maximizes the capacity of the discrete motion prior, but also efficiently abstracts the action space during the task learning phase. We demonstrate that our agent can produce diverse yet smooth motions simply by traversing the learned motion prior through unconditional motion generation. Furthermore, our model robustly satisfies sparse goal conditions with highly expressive natural motions, including head-mounted device tracking and motion in-betweening at irregular intervals, which could not be achieved with existing latent representations.

# A Multi-Power Law for Loss Curve Prediction Across Learning Rate Schedules 

**Authors**: Kairong Luo, Haodong Wen, Shengding Hu, Zhenbo Sun, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Kaifeng Lyu, Wenguang Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12811)  

**Abstract**: Training large models is both resource-intensive and time-consuming, making it crucial to understand the quantitative relationship between model performance and hyperparameters. In this paper, we present an empirical law that describes how the pretraining loss of large language models evolves under different learning rate schedules, such as constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect induced by learning rate decay. We extensively validate this law on various model sizes and architectures, and demonstrate that after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, the law accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss. We believe these results could offer valuable insights for understanding the dynamics of pretraining and designing learning rate schedules to improve efficiency.

# DeepPerception: Advancing R1-like Cognitive Visual Perception in MLLMs for Knowledge-Intensive Visual Grounding 

**Authors**: Xinyu Ma, Ziyang Ding, Zhicong Luo, Chi Chen, Zonghao Guo, Derek F. Wong, Xiaoyi Feng, Maosong Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12797)  

**Abstract**: Human experts excel at fine-grained visual discrimination by leveraging domain knowledge to refine perceptual features, a capability that remains underdeveloped in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite possessing vast expert-level knowledge, MLLMs struggle to integrate reasoning into visual perception, often generating direct responses without deeper analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce knowledge-intensive visual grounding (KVG), a novel visual grounding task that requires both fine-grained perception and domain-specific knowledge integration. To address the challenges of KVG, we propose DeepPerception, an MLLM enhanced with cognitive visual perception capabilities. Our approach consists of (1) an automated data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality, knowledge-aligned training samples, and (2) a two-stage training framework combining supervised fine-tuning for cognitive reasoning scaffolding and reinforcement learning to optimize perception-cognition synergy. To benchmark performance, we introduce KVG-Bench a comprehensive dataset spanning 10 domains with 1.3K manually curated test cases. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepPerception significantly outperforms direct fine-tuning, achieving +8.08\% accuracy improvements on KVG-Bench and exhibiting +4.60\% superior cross-domain generalization over baseline approaches. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive processes into MLLMs for human-like visual perception and open new directions for multimodal reasoning research. The data, codes, and models are released at this https URL.

# Quantum-Enhanced LLM Efficient Fine Tuning 

**Authors**: Xiaofei Kong, Lei Li, Menghan Dou, Zhaoyun Chen, Yuchun Wu, Guoping Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12790)  

**Abstract**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained language models via low-rank matrix approximation, which is effective in many scenarios. However, its low-rank representation capacity is constrained in complex tasks or high-rank dependency settings, potentially limiting model adaptability. Addressing the expressive bottleneck of classical low-rank approximation in fine-tuning large language models, this paper proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on a Quantum Weighted Tensor Hybrid Network (QWTHN), which leverages Quantum Neural Network (QNN). The study investigates quantum-classical hybrid parameter-efficient fine-tuning in low-rank spaces. QWTHN decomposes pre-trained weights into quantum neural network and tensor network representations, utilizing quantum state superposition and other methods to break through classical rank limitations. Experiments show that the proposed quantum fine-tuning technique for large models approaches or even surpasses the parameter efficiency of LoRA. On the CPsyCounD and R1-Distill-SFT datasets, QWTHN, compared to classical LoRA, reduces training loss by up to 15% while using 76% fewer parameters, and achieves an 8.4% performance improvement on the CPsyCounD test set. This research not only realizes lightweight and efficient adaptation of quantum resources to billion-parameter models but also validates the practical path of quantum hardware driven by large model tasks, laying the first engineering-ready technical foundation for future quantum-enhanced AGI systems.

# SAM2 for Image and Video Segmentation: A Comprehensive Survey 

**Authors**: Zhang Jiaxing, Tang Hao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12781)  

**Abstract**: Despite significant advances in deep learning for image and video segmentation, existing models continue to face challenges in cross-domain adaptability and generalization. Image and video segmentation are fundamental tasks in computer vision with wide-ranging applications in healthcare, agriculture, industrial inspection, and autonomous driving. With the advent of large-scale foundation models, SAM2 - an improved version of SAM (Segment Anything Model)has been optimized for segmentation tasks, demonstrating enhanced performance in complex scenarios. However, SAM2's adaptability and limitations in specific domains require further investigation. This paper systematically analyzes the application of SAM2 in image and video segmentation and evaluates its performance in various fields. We begin by introducing the foundational concepts of image segmentation, categorizing foundation models, and exploring the technical characteristics of SAM and SAM2. Subsequently, we delve into SAM2's applications in static image and video segmentation, emphasizing its performance in specialized areas such as medical imaging and the challenges of cross-domain adaptability. As part of our research, we reviewed over 200 related papers to provide a comprehensive analysis of the topic. Finally, the paper highlights the strengths and weaknesses of SAM2 in segmentation tasks, identifies the technical challenges it faces, and proposes future development directions. This review provides valuable insights and practical recommendations for optimizing and applying SAM2 in real-world scenarios.

# LangDA: Building Context-Awareness via Language for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation 

**Authors**: Chang Liu, Bavesh Balaji, Saad Hossain, C Thomas, Kwei-Herng Lai, Raviteja Vemulapalli, Alexander Wong, Sirisha Rambhatla  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12780)  

**Abstract**: Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (DASS) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a target domain with no labels. Two key approaches in DASS are (1) vision-only approaches using masking or multi-resolution crops, and (2) language-based approaches that use generic class-wise prompts informed by target domain (e.g. "a {snowy} photo of a {class}"). However, the former is susceptible to noisy pseudo-labels that are biased to the source domain. The latter does not fully capture the intricate spatial relationships of objects -- key for dense prediction tasks. To this end, we propose LangDA. LangDA addresses these challenges by, first, learning contextual relationships between objects via VLM-generated scene descriptions (e.g. "a pedestrian is on the sidewalk, and the street is lined with buildings."). Second, LangDA aligns the entire image features with text representation of this context-aware scene caption and learns generalized representations via text. With this, LangDA sets the new state-of-the-art across three DASS benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by 2.6%, 1.4% and 3.9%.

# Adaptive Deep Learning for Multiclass Breast Cancer Classification via Misprediction Risk Analysis 

**Authors**: Gul Sheeraz, Qun Chen, Liu Feiyu, Zhou Fengjin MD  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12778)  

**Abstract**: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes, yet the diagnostic process is often complex and prone to inconsistencies among pathologists. Computer-aided diagnostic approaches have significantly enhanced breast cancer detection, particularly in binary classification (benign vs. malignant). However, these methods face challenges in multiclass classification, leading to frequent mispredictions. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive learning approach for multiclass breast cancer classification using H&E-stained histopathology images. First, we introduce a misprediction risk analysis framework that quantifies and ranks the likelihood of an image being mislabeled by a classifier. This framework leverages an interpretable risk model that requires only a small number of labeled samples for training. Next, we present an adaptive learning strategy that fine-tunes classifiers based on the specific characteristics of a given dataset. This approach minimizes misprediction risk, allowing the classifier to adapt effectively to the target workload. We evaluate our proposed solutions on real benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our risk analysis framework more accurately identifies mispredictions compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our adaptive learning approach significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art deep neural network classifiers.

# NuPlanQA: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Multi-View Driving Scene Understanding in Multi-Modal Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Sung-Yeon Park, Can Cui, Yunsheng Ma, Ahmadreza Moradipari, Rohit Gupta, Kyungtae Han, Ziran Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12772)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at this https URL.

# MAP: Multi-user Personalization with Collaborative LLM-powered Agents 

**Authors**: Christine Lee, Jihye Choi, Bilge Mutlu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12757)  

**Abstract**: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-powered agents in multi-user settings underscores the need for reliable, usable methods to accommodate diverse preferences and resolve conflicting directives. Drawing on conflict resolution theory, we introduce a user-centered workflow for multi-user personalization comprising three stages: Reflection, Analysis, and Feedback. We then present MAP -- a \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent system for multi-user \textbf{P}ersonalization -- to operationalize this workflow. By delegating subtasks to specialized agents, MAP (1) retrieves and reflects on relevant user information, while enhancing reliability through agent-to-agent interactions, (2) provides detailed analysis for improved transparency and usability, and (3) integrates user feedback to iteratively refine results. Our user study findings (n=12) highlight MAP's effectiveness and usability for conflict resolution while emphasizing the importance of user involvement in resolution verification and failure management. This work highlights the potential of multi-agent systems to implement user-centered, multi-user personalization workflows and concludes by offering insights for personalization in multi-user contexts.

**Abstract**: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based slicing policies have shown significant success in simulated environments but face challenges in physical systems such as open radio access networks (O-RANs) due to simulation-to-reality gaps. These policies often lack safety guarantees to ensure compliance with service level agreements (SLAs), such as the strict latency requirements of immersive applications. As a result, a deployed DRL slicing agent may make resource allocation (RA) decisions that degrade system performance, particularly in previously unseen scenarios. Real-world immersive applications require maintaining SLA constraints throughout deployment to prevent risky DRL exploration. In this paper, we propose SafeSlice to address both the cumulative (trajectory-wise) and instantaneous (state-wise) latency constraints of O-RAN slices. We incorporate the cumulative constraints by designing a sigmoid-based risk-sensitive reward function that reflects the slices' latency requirements. Moreover, we build a supervised learning cost model as part of a safety layer that projects the slicing agent's RA actions to the nearest safe actions, fulfilling instantaneous constraints. We conduct an exhaustive experiment that supports multiple services, including real virtual reality (VR) gaming traffic, to investigate the performance of SafeSlice under extreme and changing deployment conditions. SafeSlice achieves reductions of up to 83.23% in average cumulative latency, 93.24% in instantaneous latency violations, and 22.13% in resource consumption compared to the baselines. The results also indicate SafeSlice's robustness to changing the threshold configurations of latency constraints, a vital deployment scenario that will be realized by the O-RAN paradigm to empower mobile network operators (MNOs).

# TNCSE: Tensor's Norm Constraints for Unsupervised Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings 

**Authors**: Tianyu Zong, Bingkang Shi, Hongzhu Yi, Jungang Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12739)  

**Abstract**: Unsupervised sentence embedding representation has become a hot research topic in natural language processing. As a tensor, sentence embedding has two critical properties: direction and norm. Existing works have been limited to constraining only the orientation of the samples' representations while ignoring the features of their module lengths. To address this issue, we propose a new training objective that optimizes the training of unsupervised contrastive learning by constraining the module length features between positive samples. We combine the training objective of Tensor's Norm Constraints with ensemble learning to propose a new Sentence Embedding representation framework, TNCSE. We evaluate seven semantic text similarity tasks, and the results show that TNCSE and derived models are the current state-of-the-art approach; in addition, we conduct extensive zero-shot evaluations, and the results show that TNCSE outperforms other baselines.

**Authors**: Philip Quirke, Clement Neo, Abir Harrasse, Dhruv Nathawani, Amir Abdullah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12730)  

**Abstract**: Mechanistic interpretability research faces a gap between analyzing simple circuits in toy tasks and discovering features in large models. To bridge this gap, we propose text-to-SQL generation as an ideal task to study, as it combines the formal structure of toy tasks with real-world complexity. We introduce TinySQL, a synthetic dataset progressing from basic to advanced SQL operations, and train models ranging from 33M to 1B parameters to establish a comprehensive testbed for interpretability. We apply multiple complementary interpretability techniques, including edge attribution patching and sparse autoencoders, to identify minimal circuits and components supporting SQL generation. Our analysis reveals both the potential and limitations of current interpretability methods, showing how circuits can vary even across similar queries. Lastly, we demonstrate how mechanistic interpretability can identify flawed heuristics in models and improve synthetic dataset design. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing interpretability techniques while establishing clear boundaries for their reliable application.

# Dynamic Angle Selection in X-Ray CT: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimal Stopping 

**Authors**: Tianyuan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12688)  

**Abstract**: In industrial X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the need for rapid in-line inspection is critical. Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains underutilized. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (OED). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigated the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to real-world data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.

# Plausibility Vaccine: Injecting LLM Knowledge for Event Plausibility 

**Authors**: Jacob Chmura, Jonah Dauvet, Sebastian Sabry  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12667)  

**Abstract**: Despite advances in language modelling, distributional methods that build semantic representations from co-occurrences fail to discriminate between plausible and implausible events. In this work, we investigate how plausibility prediction can be improved by injecting latent knowledge prompted from large language models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We train 12 task adapters to learn various physical properties and association measures and perform adapter fusion to compose latent semantic knowledge from each task on top of pre-trained AlBERT embeddings. We automate auxiliary task data generation, which enables us to scale our approach and fine-tune our learned representations across two plausibility datasets. Our code is available at this https URL.

# FW-Merging: Scaling Model Merging with Frank-Wolfe Optimization 

**Authors**: Hao Mark Chen, Shell Xu Hu, Wayne Luk, Timothy Hospedales, Hongxiang Fan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12649)  

**Abstract**: Model merging has emerged as a promising approach for multi-task learning (MTL), offering a data-efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning. However, with the rapid development of the open-source AI ecosystem and the increasing availability of fine-tuned foundation models, existing model merging methods face two key limitations: (i) They are primarily designed for in-house fine-tuned models, making them less adaptable to diverse model sources with partially unknown model and task information, (ii) They struggle to scale effectively when merging numerous model checkpoints. To address these challenges, we formulate model merging as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel approach: Frank-Wolfe Merging (FW-Merging). Inspired by Frank-Wolfe optimization, our approach iteratively selects the most relevant model in the pool to minimize a linear approximation of the objective function and then executes a local merging similar to the Frank-Wolfe update. The objective function is designed to capture the desired behavior of the target-merged model, while the fine-tuned candidate models define the constraint set. More importantly, FW-Merging serves as an orthogonal technique for existing merging methods, seamlessly integrating with them to further enhance accuracy performance. Our experiments show that FW-Merging scales across diverse model sources, remaining stable with 16 irrelevant models and improving by 15.3% with 16 relevant models on 20 CV tasks, while maintaining constant memory overhead, unlike the linear overhead of data-informed merging methods. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, FW-Merging surpasses the data-free merging method by 32.8% and outperforms the data-informed Adamerging by 8.39% when merging 20 ViT models.

# COVID 19 Diagnosis Analysis using Transfer Learning 

**Authors**: Anjali Dharmik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12642)  

**Abstract**: Coronaviruses transmit COVID-19, a rapidly spreading disease. A Coronavirus infection (COVID-19) was first discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the planet in exactly some months. because of this, the virus can cause severe symptoms and even death, especially within the elderly and in people with medical conditions. The virus causes acute respiratory infections in humans. the primary case was diagnosed in China in 2019 and the pandemic started in 2020. Since the quantity of cases of COVID-19 is increasing daily, there are only a limited number of test kits available in hospitals. So, to stop COVID-19 from spreading among people, an automatic diagnosis system must be implemented. during this study, three pre-trained neural networks supported convolutional neural networks (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50) are proposed for detecting Coronavirus pneumonia infected patients through X-rays and computerized tomography (CT). By using cross-validation, we've got implemented binary classifications with two classes (COVID-19, Normal (healthy)). Taking into consideration the results obtained, the pre-trained ResNet50 model provides the simplest classification performance (97.77% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 93.33% specificity, 98.00% F1-score) among the opposite three used models over 6259 images.

# Hybrid Learners Do Not Forget: A Brain-Inspired Neuro-Symbolic Approach to Continual Learning 

**Authors**: Amin Banayeeanzade, Mohammad Rostami  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12635)  

**Abstract**: Continual learning is crucial for creating AI agents that can learn and improve themselves autonomously. A primary challenge in continual learning is to learn new tasks without losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning methods primarily focus on enabling a neural network with mechanisms that mitigate forgetting effects. Inspired by the two distinct systems in the human brain, System 1 and System 2, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Brain-Inspired Continual Learning (NeSyBiCL) framework that incorporates two subsystems to solve continual learning: A neural network model responsible for quickly adapting to the most recent task, together with a symbolic reasoner responsible for retaining previously acquired knowledge from previous tasks. Moreover, we design an integration mechanism between these components to facilitate knowledge transfer from the symbolic reasoner to the neural network. We also introduce two compositional continual learning benchmarks and demonstrate that NeSyBiCL is effective and leads to superior performance compared to continual learning methods that merely rely on neural architectures to address forgetting.

# MAVEN: Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network 

**Authors**: Vrushank Ahire, Kunal Shah, Mudasir Nazir Khan, Nikhil Pakhale, Lownish Rai Sookha, M. A. Ganaie, Abhinav Dhall  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12623)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces MAVEN (Multi-modal Attention for Valence-Arousal Emotion Network), a novel architecture for dynamic emotion recognition through dimensional modeling of affect. The model uniquely integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities via a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism with six distinct attention pathways, enabling comprehensive interactions between all modality pairs. Our proposed approach employs modality-specific encoders to extract rich feature representations from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts. The architecture's novelty lies in its cross-modal enhancement strategy, where each modality representation is refined through weighted attention from other modalities, followed by self-attention refinement through modality-specific encoders. Rather than directly predicting valence-arousal values, MAVEN predicts emotions in a polar coordinate form, aligning with psychological models of the emotion circumplex. Experimental evaluation on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with performance measured using Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). The multi-stage architecture demonstrates superior ability to capture the complex, nuanced nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in continuous emotion recognition in-the-wild.

# Scaling Semantic Categories: Investigating the Impact on Vision Transformer Labeling Performance 

**Authors**: Anthony Lamelas, Harrison Muchnic  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12617)  

**Abstract**: This study explores the impact of scaling semantic categories on the image classification performance of vision transformers (ViTs). In this specific case, the CLIP server provided by Jina AI is used for experimentation. The research hypothesizes that as the number of ground truth and artificially introduced semantically equivalent categories increases, the labeling accuracy of ViTs improves until a theoretical maximum or limit is reached. A wide variety of image datasets were chosen to test this hypothesis. These datasets were processed through a custom function in Python designed to evaluate the model's accuracy, with adjustments being made to account for format differences between datasets. By exponentially introducing new redundant categories, the experiment assessed accuracy trends until they plateaued, decreased, or fluctuated inconsistently. The findings show that while semantic scaling initially increases model performance, the benefits diminish or reverse after surpassing a critical threshold, providing insight into the limitations and possible optimization of category labeling strategies for ViTs.

# Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies 

**Authors**: Rashid Mushkani, Hugo Berard, Shin Koseki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12613)  

**Abstract**: Cities are not monolithic; they are arenas of negotiation among groups that hold varying needs, values, and experiences. Conventional methods of urban assessment -- from standardized surveys to AI-driven evaluations -- frequently rely on a single consensus metric (e.g., an average measure of inclusivity or safety). Although such aggregations simplify design decisions, they risk obscuring the distinct perspectives of marginalized populations. In this paper, we present findings from a community-centered study in Montreal involving 35 residents with diverse demographic and social identities, particularly wheelchair users, seniors, and LGBTQIA2+ individuals. Using rating and ranking tasks on 20 urban sites, we observe that disagreements are systematic rather than random, reflecting structural inequalities, differing cultural values, and personal experiences of safety and accessibility.
Based on these empirical insights, we propose negotiative alignment, an AI framework that treats disagreement as an essential input to be preserved, analyzed, and addressed. Negotiative alignment builds on pluralistic models by dynamically updating stakeholder preferences through multi-agent negotiation mechanisms, ensuring no single perspective is marginalized. We outline how this framework can be integrated into urban analytics -- and other decision-making contexts -- to retain minority viewpoints, adapt to changing stakeholder concerns, and enhance fairness and accountability. The study demonstrates that preserving and engaging with disagreement, rather than striving for an artificial consensus, can produce more equitable and responsive AI-driven outcomes in urban design.

# Point Cloud Based Scene Segmentation: A Survey 

**Authors**: Dan Halperin, Niklas Eisl  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12595)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous driving is a safety-critical application, and it is therefore a top priority that the accompanying assistance systems are able to provide precise information about the surrounding environment of the vehicle. Tasks such as 3D Object Detection deliver an insufficiently detailed understanding of the surrounding scene because they only predict a bounding box for foreground objects. In contrast, 3D Semantic Segmentation provides richer and denser information about the environment by assigning a label to each individual point, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving tasks, such as navigation or lane changes. To inspire future research, in this review paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art methods in the field of Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation for autonomous driving. We categorize the approaches into projection-based, 3D-based and hybrid methods. Moreover, we discuss the most important and commonly used datasets for this task and also emphasize the importance of synthetic data to support research when real-world data is limited. We further present the results of the different methods and compare them with respect to their segmentation accuracy and efficiency.

**Authors**: Thayer Alshaabi, Daniel E. Milkie, Gaoxiang Liu, Cyna Shirazinejad, Jason L. Hong, Kemal Achour, Frederik Görlitz, Ana Milunovic-Jevtic, Cat Simmons, Ibrahim S. Abuzahriyeh, Erin Hong, Samara Erin Williams, Nathanael Harrison, Evan Huang, Eun Seok Bae, Alison N. Killilea, David G. Drubin, Ian A. Swinburne, Srigokul Upadhyayula, Eric Betzig  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12593)  

**Abstract**: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.

**Authors**: Harshit  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12592)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) development has become increasingly centralized, limiting participation to well-resourced organizations. This paper introduces MoECollab, a novel framework leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to enable distributed, collaborative LLM development. By decomposing monolithic models into specialized expert modules coordinated by a trainable gating network, our framework allows diverse contributors to participate regardless of computational resources. We provide a complete technical implementation with mathematical foundations for expert dynamics, gating mechanisms, and integration strategies. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves accuracy improvements of 3-7% over baseline models while reducing computational requirements by 34%. Expert specialization yields significant domain-specific gains, with improvements from 51% to 88% F1 score in general classification and from 23% to 44% accuracy in news categorization. We formalize the routing entropy optimization problem and demonstrate how proper regularization techniques lead to 14% higher expert utilization rates. These results validate MoECollab as an effective approach for democratizing LLM development through architecturally-supported collaboration.

# BalancedDPO: Adaptive Multi-Metric Alignment 

**Authors**: Dipesh Tamboli, Souradip Chakraborty, Aditya Malusare, Biplab Banerjee, Amrit Singh Bedi, Vaneet Aggarwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12575)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made remarkable advancements, yet aligning them with diverse preferences remains a persistent challenge. Current methods often optimize single metrics or depend on narrowly curated datasets, leading to overfitting and limited generalization across key visual quality metrics. We present BalancedDPO, a novel extension of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that addresses these limitations by simultaneously aligning T2I diffusion models with multiple metrics, including human preference, CLIP score, and aesthetic quality. Our key novelty lies in aggregating consensus labels from diverse metrics in the preference distribution space as compared to existing reward mixing approaches, enabling robust and scalable multi-metric alignment while maintaining the simplicity of the standard DPO pipeline that we refer to as BalancedDPO. Our evaluations on the Pick-a-Pic, PartiPrompt and HPD datasets show that BalancedDPO achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing approaches across all major metrics. BalancedDPO improves the average win rates by 15%, 7.1%, and 10.3% on Pick-a-pic, PartiPrompt and HPD, respectively, from the DiffusionDPO.

# Deblur Gaussian Splatting SLAM 

**Authors**: Francesco Girlanda, Denys Rozumnyi, Marc Pollefeys, Martin R. Oswald  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12572)  

**Abstract**: We present Deblur-SLAM, a robust RGB SLAM pipeline designed to recover sharp reconstructions from motion-blurred inputs. The proposed method bridges the strengths of both frame-to-frame and frame-to-model approaches to model sub-frame camera trajectories that lead to high-fidelity reconstructions in motion-blurred settings. Moreover, our pipeline incorporates techniques such as online loop closure and global bundle adjustment to achieve a dense and precise global trajectory. We model the physical image formation process of motion-blurred images and minimize the error between the observed blurry images and rendered blurry images obtained by averaging sharp virtual sub-frame images. Additionally, by utilizing a monocular depth estimator alongside the online deformation of Gaussians, we ensure precise mapping and enhanced image deblurring. The proposed SLAM pipeline integrates all these components to improve the results. We achieve state-of-the-art results for sharp map estimation and sub-frame trajectory recovery both on synthetic and real-world blurry input data.

# From Guessing to Asking: An Approach to Resolving the Persona Knowledge Gap in LLMs during Multi-Turn Conversations 

**Authors**: Sarvesh Baskar, Tanmay Tulsidas Verelakar, Srinivasan Parthasarathy, Manas Gaur  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12556)  

**Abstract**: In multi-turn dialogues, large language models (LLM) face a critical challenge of ensuring coherence while adapting to user-specific information. This study introduces the persona knowledge gap, the discrepancy between a model's internal understanding and the knowledge required for coherent, personalized conversations. While prior research has recognized these gaps, computational methods for their identification and resolution remain underexplored. We propose Conversation Preference Elicitation and Recommendation (CPER), a novel framework that dynamically detects and resolves persona knowledge gaps using intrinsic uncertainty quantification and feedback-driven refinement. CPER consists of three key modules: a Contextual Understanding Module for preference extraction, a Dynamic Feedback Module for measuring uncertainty and refining persona alignment, and a Persona-Driven Response Generation module for adapting responses based on accumulated user context. We evaluate CPER on two real-world datasets: CCPE-M for preferential movie recommendations and ESConv for mental health support. Using A/B testing, human evaluators preferred CPER's responses 42% more often than baseline models in CCPE-M and 27% more often in ESConv. A qualitative human evaluation confirms that CPER's responses are preferred for maintaining contextual relevance and coherence, particularly in longer (12+ turn) conversations.

# Grasping Partially Occluded Objects Using Autoencoder-Based Point Cloud Inpainting 

**Authors**: Alexander Koebler, Ralf Gross, Florian Buettner, Ingo Thon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12549)  

**Abstract**: Flexible industrial production systems will play a central role in the future of manufacturing due to higher product individualization and customization. A key component in such systems is the robotic grasping of known or unknown objects in random positions. Real-world applications often come with challenges that might not be considered in grasping solutions tested in simulation or lab settings. Partial occlusion of the target object is the most prominent. Examples of occlusion can be supporting structures in the camera's field of view, sensor imprecision, or parts occluding each other due to the production process. In all these cases, the resulting lack of information leads to shortcomings in calculating grasping points. In this paper, we present an algorithm to reconstruct the missing information. Our inpainting solution facilitates the real-world utilization of robust object matching approaches for grasping point calculation. We demonstrate the benefit of our solution by enabling an existing grasping system embedded in a real-world industrial application to handle occlusions in the input. With our solution, we drastically decrease the number of objects discarded by the process.

# STEVE: AStep Verification Pipeline for Computer-use Agent Training 

**Authors**: Fanbin Lu, Zhisheng Zhong, Ziqin Wei, Shu Liu, Chi-Wing Fu, Jiaya Jia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12532)  

**Abstract**: Developing AI agents to autonomously manipulate graphical user interfaces is a long challenging task. Recent advances in data scaling law inspire us to train computer-use agents with a scaled instruction set, yet using behavior cloning to train agents still requires immense high-quality trajectories. To meet the scalability need, we designed STEVE, a step verification pipeline for computer-use agent training. First, we establish a large instruction set for computer-use agents and collect trajectory data with some suboptimal agents. GPT-4o is used to verify the correctness of each step in the trajectories based on the screens before and after the action execution, assigning each step with a binary label. Last, we adopt the Kahneman and Tversky Optimization to optimize the agent from the binary stepwise labels. Extensive experiments manifest that our agent outperforms supervised finetuning by leveraging both positive and negative actions within a trajectory. Also, STEVE enables us to train a 7B vision-language model as a computer-use agent, achieving leading performance in the challenging live desktop environment WinAgentArena with great efficiency at a reduced cost.

# HyConEx: Hypernetwork classifier with counterfactual explanations 

**Authors**: Patryk Marszałek, Ulvi Movsum-zada, Oleksii Furman, Kamil Książek, Przemysław Spurek, Marek Śmieja  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12525)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in explainable AI methods. We want not only to make accurate predictions using sophisticated neural networks but also to understand what the model's decision is based on. One of the fundamental levels of interpretability is to provide counterfactual examples explaining the rationale behind the decision and identifying which features, and to what extent, must be modified to alter the model's outcome. To address these requirements, we introduce HyConEx, a classification model based on deep hypernetworks specifically designed for tabular data. Owing to its unique architecture, HyConEx not only provides class predictions but also delivers local interpretations for individual data samples in the form of counterfactual examples that steer a given sample toward an alternative class. While many explainable methods generated counterfactuals for external models, there have been no interpretable classifiers simultaneously producing counterfactual samples so far. HyConEx achieves competitive performance on several metrics assessing classification accuracy and fulfilling the criteria of a proper counterfactual attack. This makes HyConEx a distinctive deep learning model, which combines predictions and explainers as an all-in-one neural network. The code is available at this https URL.

# LLM-Driven Multi-step Translation from C to Rust using Static Analysis 

**Authors**: Tianyang Zhou, Haowen Lin, Somesh Jha, Mihai Christodorescu, Kirill Levchenko, Varun Chandrasekaran  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12511)  

**Abstract**: Translating software written in legacy languages to modern languages, such as C to Rust, has significant benefits in improving memory safety while maintaining high performance. However, manual translation is cumbersome, error-prone, and produces unidiomatic code. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in producing idiomatic translations, but offer no correctness guarantees as they lack the ability to capture all the semantics differences between the source and target languages. To resolve this issue, we propose SACTOR, an LLM-driven C-to-Rust zero-shot translation tool using a two-step translation methodology: an "unidiomatic" step to translate C into Rust while preserving semantics, and an "idiomatic" step to refine the code to follow Rust's semantic standards. SACTOR utilizes information provided by static analysis of the source C program to address challenges such as pointer semantics and dependency resolution. To validate the correctness of the translated result from each step, we use end-to-end testing via the foreign function interface to embed our translated code segment into the original code. We evaluate the translation of 200 programs from two datasets and two case studies, comparing the performance of GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Llama 3.3 70B and DeepSeek-R1 in SACTOR. Our results demonstrate that SACTOR achieves high correctness and improved idiomaticity, with the best-performing model (DeepSeek-R1) reaching 93% and (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, DeepSeek-R1) reaching 84% correctness (on each dataset, respectively), while producing more natural and Rust-compliant translations compared to existing methods.

# A Reservoir-based Model for Human-like Perception of Complex Rhythm Pattern 

**Authors**: Zhongju Yuan, Geraint Wiggins, Dick Botteldooren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12509)  

**Abstract**: Rhythm is a fundamental aspect of human behaviour, present from infancy and deeply embedded in cultural practices. Rhythm anticipation is a spontaneous cognitive process that typically occurs before the onset of actual beats. While most research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence has focused on metronome-based rhythm tasks, studies investigating the perception of complex musical rhythm patterns remain limited. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical oscillator-based model to better understand the perception of complex musical rhythms in biological systems. The model consists of two types of coupled neurons that generate oscillations, with different layers tuned to respond to distinct perception levels. We evaluate the model using several representative rhythm patterns spanning the upper, middle, and lower bounds of human musical perception. Our findings demonstrate that, while maintaining a high degree of synchronization accuracy, the model exhibits human-like rhythmic behaviours. Additionally, the beta band neuronal activity in the model mirrors patterns observed in the human brain, further validating the biological plausibility of the approach.

# A General Close-loop Predictive Coding Framework for Auditory Working Memory 

**Authors**: Zhongju Yuan, Geraint Wiggins, Dick Botteldooren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12506)  

**Abstract**: Auditory working memory is essential for various daily activities, such as language acquisition, conversation. It involves the temporary storage and manipulation of information that is no longer present in the environment. While extensively studied in neuroscience and cognitive science, research on its modeling within neural networks remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a general framework based on a close-loop predictive coding paradigm to perform short auditory signal memory tasks. The framework is evaluated on two widely used benchmark datasets for environmental sound and speech, demonstrating high semantic similarity across both datasets.

# Facilitating Automated Online Consensus Building through Parallel Thinking 

**Authors**: Wen Gu, Zhaoxing Li, Jan Buermann, Jim Dilkes, Dimitris Michailidis, Shinobu Hasegawa, Vahid Yazdanpanah, Sebastian Stein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12499)  

**Abstract**: Consensus building is inherently challenging due to the diverse opinions held by stakeholders. Effective facilitation is crucial to support the consensus building process and enable efficient group decision making. However, the effectiveness of facilitation is often constrained by human factors such as limited experience and scalability. In this research, we propose a Parallel Thinking-based Facilitation Agent (PTFA) that facilitates online, text-based consensus building processes. The PTFA automatically collects textual posts and leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform all of the six distinct roles of the well-established Six Thinking Hats technique in parallel thinking. To illustrate the potential of PTFA, a pilot study was carried out and PTFA's ability in idea generation, emotional probing, and deeper analysis of ideas was demonstrated. Furthermore, a comprehensive dataset that contains not only the conversational content among the participants but also between the participants and the agent is constructed for future study.

**Abstract**: Malicious users attempt to replicate commercial models functionally at low cost by training a clone model with query responses. It is challenging to timely prevent such model-stealing attacks to achieve strong protection and maintain utility. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric detector called Account-aware Distribution Discrepancy (ADD) to recognize queries from malicious users by leveraging account-wise local dependency. We formulate each class as a Multivariate Normal distribution (MVN) in the feature space and measure the malicious score as the sum of weighted class-wise distribution discrepancy. The ADD detector is combined with random-based prediction poisoning to yield a plug-and-play defense module named D-ADD for image classification models. Results of extensive experimental studies show that D-ADD achieves strong defense against different types of attacks with little interference in serving benign users for both soft and hard-label settings.

**Authors**: Zilun Zhang, Haozhan Shen, Tiancheng Zhao, Bin Chen, Zian Guan, Yuhao Wang, Xu Jia, Yuxiang Cai, Yongheng Shang, Jianwei Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12490)  

**Abstract**: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.

# SING: Semantic Image Communications using Null-Space and INN-Guided Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Jiakang Chen, Selim F. Yilmaz, Di You, Pier Luigi Dragotti, Deniz Gündüz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12484)  

**Abstract**: Joint source-channel coding systems based on deep neural networks (DeepJSCC) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in wireless image transmission. Existing methods primarily focus on minimizing distortion between the transmitted image and the reconstructed version at the receiver, often overlooking perceptual quality. This can lead to severe perceptual degradation when transmitting images under extreme conditions, such as low bandwidth compression ratios (BCRs) and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). In this work, we propose SING, a novel two-stage JSCC framework that formulates the recovery of high-quality source images from corrupted reconstructions as an inverse problem. Depending on the availability of information about the DeepJSCC encoder/decoder and the channel at the receiver, SING can either approximate the stochastic degradation as a linear transformation, or leverage invertible neural networks (INNs) for precise modeling. Both approaches enable the seamless integration of diffusion models into the reconstruction process, enhancing perceptual quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SING outperforms DeepJSCC and other approaches, delivering superior perceptual quality even under extremely challenging conditions, including scenarios with significant distribution mismatches between the training and test data.

# KDSelector: A Knowledge-Enhanced and Data-Efficient Model Selector Learning Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection 

**Authors**: Zhiyu Liang, Dongrui Cai, Chenyuan Zhang, Zheng Liang, Chen Liang, Bo Zheng, Shi Qiu, Jin Wang, Hongzhi Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12478)  

**Abstract**: Model selection has been raised as an essential problem in the area of time series anomaly detection (TSAD), because there is no single best TSAD model for the highly heterogeneous time series in real-world applications. However, despite the success of existing model selection solutions that train a classification model (especially neural network, NN) using historical data as a selector to predict the correct TSAD model for each series, the NN-based selector learning methods used by existing solutions do not make full use of the knowledge in the historical data and require iterating over all training samples, which limits the accuracy and training speed of the selector. To address these limitations, we propose KDSelector, a novel knowledge-enhanced and data-efficient framework for learning the NN-based TSAD model selector, of which three key components are specifically designed to integrate available knowledge into the selector and dynamically prune less important and redundant samples during the learning. We develop a TSAD model selection system with KDSelector as the internal, to demonstrate how users improve the accuracy and training speed of their selectors by using KDSelector as a plug-and-play module. Our demonstration video is hosted at this https URL.

# ISLR101: an Iranian Word-Level Sign Language Recognition Dataset 

**Authors**: Hossein Ranjbar, Alireza Taheri  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12451)  

**Abstract**: Sign language recognition involves modeling complex multichannel information, such as hand shapes and movements while relying on sufficient sign language-specific data. However, sign languages are often under-resourced, posing a significant challenge for research and development in this field. To address this gap, we introduce ISLR101, the first publicly available Iranian Sign Language dataset for isolated sign language recognition. This comprehensive dataset includes 4,614 videos covering 101 distinct signs, recorded by 10 different signers (3 deaf individuals, 2 sign language interpreters, and 5 L2 learners) against varied backgrounds, with a resolution of 800x600 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second. It also includes skeleton pose information extracted using OpenPose. We establish both a visual appearance-based and a skeleton-based framework as baseline models, thoroughly training and evaluating them on ISLR101. These models achieve 97.01% and 94.02% accuracy on the test set, respectively. Additionally, we publish the train, validation, and test splits to facilitate fair comparisons.

# Causality Model for Semantic Understanding on Videos 

**Authors**: Li Yicong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12447)  

**Abstract**: After a decade of prosperity, the development of video understanding has reached a critical juncture, where the sole reliance on massive data and complex architectures is no longer a one-size-fits-all solution to all situations. The presence of ubiquitous data imbalance hampers DNNs from effectively learning the underlying causal mechanisms, leading to significant performance drops when encountering distribution shifts, such as long-tail imbalances and perturbed imbalances. This realization has prompted researchers to seek alternative methodologies to capture causal patterns in video data. To tackle these challenges and increase the robustness of DNNs, causal modeling emerged as a principle to discover the true causal patterns behind the observed correlations. This thesis focuses on the domain of semantic video understanding and explores the potential of causal modeling to advance two fundamental tasks: Video Relation Detection (VidVRD) and Video Question Answering (VideoQA).

# BREEN: Bridge Data-Efficient Encoder-Free Multimodal Learning with Learnable Queries 

**Authors**: Tianle Li, Yongming Rao, Winston Hu, Yu Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12446)  

**Abstract**: Encoder-free multimodal large language models(MLLMs) eliminate the need for a well-trained vision encoder by directly processing image tokens before the language model. While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches.

# Towards Learnable Anchor for Deep Multi-View Clustering 

**Authors**: Bocheng Wang, Chusheng Zeng, Mulin Chen, Xuelong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12427)  

**Abstract**: Deep multi-view clustering incorporating graph learning has presented tremendous potential. Most methods encounter costly square time consumption w.r.t. data size. Theoretically, anchor-based graph learning can alleviate this limitation, but related deep models mainly rely on manual discretization approaches to select anchors, which indicates that 1) the anchors are fixed during model training and 2) they may deviate from the true cluster distribution. Consequently, the unreliable anchors may corrupt clustering results. In this paper, we propose the Deep Multi-view Anchor Clustering (DMAC) model that performs clustering in linear time. Concretely, the initial anchors are intervened by the positive-incentive noise sampled from Gaussian distribution, such that they can be optimized with a newly designed anchor learning loss, which promotes a clear relationship between samples and anchors. Afterwards, anchor graph convolution is devised to model the cluster structure formed by the anchors, and the mutual information maximization loss is built to provide cross-view clustering guidance. In this way, the learned anchors can better represent clusters. With the optimal anchors, the full sample graph is calculated to derive a discriminative embedding for clustering. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of DMAC compared to state-of-the-art competitors.

# Bio-Inspired Plastic Neural Networks for Zero-Shot Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Complex Animal-Inspired Robots 

**Authors**: Binggwong Leung, Worasuchad Haomachai, Joachim Winther Pedersen, Sebastian Risi, Poramate Manoonpong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12406)  

**Abstract**: Artificial neural networks can be used to solve a variety of robotic tasks. However, they risk failing catastrophically when faced with out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. Several approaches have employed a type of synaptic plasticity known as Hebbian learning that can dynamically adjust weights based on local neural activities. Research has shown that synaptic plasticity can make policies more robust and help them adapt to unforeseen changes in the environment. However, networks augmented with Hebbian learning can lead to weight divergence, resulting in network instability. Furthermore, such Hebbian networks have not yet been applied to solve legged locomotion in complex real robots with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we improve the Hebbian network with a weight normalization mechanism for preventing weight divergence, analyze the principal components of the Hebbian's weights, and perform a thorough evaluation of network performance in locomotion control for real 18-DOF dung beetle-like and 16-DOF gecko-like robots. We find that the Hebbian-based plastic network can execute zero-shot sim-to-real adaptation locomotion and generalize to unseen conditions, such as uneven terrain and morphological damage.

# Unveiling Pitfalls: Understanding Why AI-driven Code Agents Fail at GitHub Issue Resolution 

**Authors**: Zhi Chen, Wei Ma, Lingxiao Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12374)  

**Abstract**: AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.

# Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation 

**Authors**: Byung Hyun Lee, Sungjin Lim, Se Young Chun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12356)  

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.

# Synthetic Data for Robust AI Model Development in Regulated Enterprises 

**Authors**: Aditi Godbole  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12353)  

**Abstract**: In today's business landscape, organizations need to find the right balance between using their customers' data ethically to power AI solutions and being compliant regarding data privacy and data usage regulations. In this paper, we discuss synthetic data as a possible solution to this dilemma. Synthetic data is simulated data that mimics the real data. We explore how organizations in heavily regulated industries, such as financial institutions or healthcare organizations, can leverage synthetic data to build robust AI solutions while staying compliant. We demonstrate that synthetic data offers two significant advantages by allowing AI models to learn from more diverse data and by helping organizations stay compliant against data privacy laws with the use of synthetic data instead of customer information. We discuss case studies to show how synthetic data can be effectively used in the finance and healthcare sector while discussing the challenges of using synthetic data and some ethical questions it raises. Our research finds that synthetic data could be a game-changer for AI in regulated industries. The potential can be realized when industry, academia, and regulators collaborate to build solutions. We aim to initiate discussions on the use of synthetic data to build ethical, responsible, and effective AI systems in regulated enterprise industries.

# General Table Question Answering via Answer-Formula Joint Generation 

**Authors**: Zhongyuan Wang, Richong Zhang, Zhijie Nie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12345)  

**Abstract**: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operations, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely-used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use Formula as the logical form for solving complex reasoning on the tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset \texttt{FromulaQA} from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously. Unlike existing methods, \texttt{TabAF} decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone, demonstrating great versatility and generalization. \texttt{TabAF} based on Llama3.1-70B achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab and TabFact.

# Augmented Adversarial Trigger Learning 

**Authors**: Zhe Wang, Yanjun Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12339)  

**Abstract**: Gradient optimization-based adversarial attack methods automate the learning of adversarial triggers to generate jailbreak prompts or leak system prompts. In this work, we take a closer look at the optimization objective of adversarial trigger learning and propose ATLA: Adversarial Trigger Learning with Augmented objectives. ATLA improves the negative log-likelihood loss used by previous studies into a weighted loss formulation that encourages the learned adversarial triggers to optimize more towards response format tokens. This enables ATLA to learn an adversarial trigger from just one query-response pair and the learned trigger generalizes well to other similar queries. We further design a variation to augment trigger optimization with an auxiliary loss that suppresses evasive responses. We showcase how to use ATLA to learn adversarial suffixes jailbreaking LLMs and to extract hidden system prompts. Empirically we demonstrate that ATLA consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, achieving nearly 100% success in attacking while requiring 80% fewer queries. ATLA learned jailbreak suffixes demonstrate high generalization to unseen queries and transfer well to new LLMs.

# When neural implant meets multimodal LLM: A dual-loop system for neuromodulation and naturalistic neuralbehavioral research 

**Authors**: Edward Hong Wang, Cynthia Xin Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12334)  

**Abstract**: We propose a novel dual-loop system that synergistically combines responsive neurostimulation (RNS) implants with artificial intelligence-driven wearable devices for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and enabling naturalistic brain research. In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.

# Leveraging Vision Capabilities of Multimodal LLMs for Automated Data Extraction from Plots 

**Authors**: Maciej P. Polak, Dane Morgan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12326)  

**Abstract**: Automated data extraction from research texts has been steadily improving, with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) accelerating progress even further. Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.

# Swift4D:Adaptive divide-and-conquer Gaussian Splatting for compact and efficient reconstruction of dynamic scene 

**Authors**: Jiahao Wu, Rui Peng, Zhiyan Wang, Lu Xiao, Luyang Tang, Jinbo Yan, Kaiqiang Xiong, Ronggang Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12307)  

**Abstract**: Novel view synthesis has long been a practical but challenging task, although the introduction of numerous methods to solve this problem, even combining advanced representations like 3D Gaussian Splatting, they still struggle to recover high-quality results and often consume too much storage memory and training time. In this paper we propose Swift4D, a divide-and-conquer 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can handle static and dynamic primitives separately, achieving a good trade-off between rendering quality and efficiency, motivated by the fact that most of the scene is the static primitive and does not require additional dynamic properties. Concretely, we focus on modeling dynamic transformations only for the dynamic primitives which benefits both efficiency and quality. We first employ a learnable decomposition strategy to separate the primitives, which relies on an additional parameter to classify primitives as static or dynamic. For the dynamic primitives, we employ a compact multi-resolution 4D Hash mapper to transform these primitives from canonical space into deformation space at each timestamp, and then mix the static and dynamic primitives to produce the final output. This divide-and-conquer method facilitates efficient training and reduces storage redundancy. Our method not only achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while being 20X faster in training than previous SOTA methods with a minimum storage requirement of only 30MB on real-world datasets. Code is available at this https URL.

# The Lucie-7B LLM and the Lucie Training Dataset: Open resources for multilingual language generation 

**Authors**: Olivier Gouvert, Julie Hunter, Jérôme Louradour, Christophe Cerisara, Evan Dufraisse, Yaya Sy, Laura Rivière, Jean-Pierre Lorré, OpenLLM-France community  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12294)  

**Abstract**: We present both the Lucie Training Dataset and the Lucie-7B foundation model. The Lucie Training Dataset is a multilingual collection of textual corpora centered around French and designed to offset anglo-centric biases found in many datasets for large language model pretraining. Its French data is pulled not only from traditional web sources, but also from French cultural heritage documents, filling an important gap in modern datasets. Beyond French, which makes up the largest share of the data, we added documents to support several other European languages, including English, Spanish, German, and Italian. Apart from its value as a resource for French language and culture, an important feature of this dataset is that it prioritizes data rights by minimizing copyrighted material. In addition, building on the philosophy of past open projects, it is redistributed in the form used for training and its processing is described on Hugging Face and GitHub. The Lucie-7B foundation model is trained on equal amounts of data in French and English -- roughly 33% each -- in an effort to better represent cultural aspects of French-speaking communities. We also describe two instruction fine-tuned models, Lucie-7B-Instruct-v1.1 and Lucie-7B-Instruct-human-data, which we release as demonstrations of Lucie-7B in use. These models achieve promising results compared to state-of-the-art models, demonstrating that an open approach prioritizing data rights can still deliver strong performance. We see these models as an initial step toward developing more performant, aligned models in the near future. Model weights for Lucie-7B and the Lucie instruct models, along with intermediate checkpoints for the former, are published on Hugging Face, while model training and data preparation code is available on GitHub. This makes Lucie-7B one of the first OSI compliant language models according to the new OSI definition.

# Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes 

**Authors**: Da Wu, Zhanliang Wang, Quan Nguyen, Kai Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12286)  

**Abstract**: Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.

# Bi-Criteria Optimization for Combinatorial Bandits: Sublinear Regret and Constraint Violation under Bandit Feedback 

**Authors**: Vaneet Aggarwal, Shweta Jain, Subham Pokhriyal, Christopher John Quinn  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12285)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we study bi-criteria optimization for combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) with bandit feedback. We propose a general framework that transforms discrete bi-criteria offline approximation algorithms into online algorithms with sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) guarantees. Our framework requires the offline algorithm to provide an $(\alpha, \beta)$-bi-criteria approximation ratio with $\delta$-resilience and utilize $\texttt{N}$ oracle calls to evaluate the objective and constraint functions. We prove that the proposed framework achieves sub-linear regret and CCV, with both bounds scaling as ${O}\left(\delta^{2/3} \texttt{N}^{1/3}T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T)\right)$. Crucially, the framework treats the offline algorithm with $\delta$-resilience as a black box, enabling flexible integration of existing approximation algorithms into the CMAB setting. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply our framework to several combinatorial problems, including submodular cover, submodular cost covering, and fair submodular maximization. These applications highlight the framework's broad utility in adapting offline guarantees to online bi-criteria optimization under bandit feedback.

# Toward Foundation Models for Online Complex Event Detection in CPS-IoT: A Case Study 

**Authors**: Liying Han, Gaofeng Dong, Xiaomin Ouyang, Lance Kaplan, Federico Cerutti, Mani Srivastava  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12282)  

**Abstract**: Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.

# Agentic Search Engine for Real-Time IoT Data 

**Authors**: Abdelrahman Elewah, Khalid Elgazzar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12255)  

**Abstract**: The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled diverse devices to communicate over the Internet, yet the fragmentation of IoT systems limits seamless data sharing and coordinated management. We have recently introduced SensorsConnect, a unified framework to enable seamless content and sensor data sharing in collaborative IoT systems, inspired by how the World Wide Web (WWW) enabled a shared and accessible space for information among humans. This paper presents the IoT Agentic Search Engine (IoT-ASE), a real-time search engine tailored for IoT environments. IoT-ASE leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to address the challenge of searching vast, real-time IoT data, enabling it to handle complex queries and deliver accurate, contextually relevant results. We implemented a use-case scenario in Toronto to demonstrate how IoT-ASE can improve service quality recommendations by leveraging real-time IoT data. Our evaluation shows that IoT-ASE achieves a 92\% accuracy in retrieving intent-based services and produces responses that are concise, relevant, and context-aware, outperforming generalized responses from systems like Gemini. These findings highlight the potential IoT-ASE to make real-time IoT data accessible and support effective, real-time decision-making.

# GenOSIL: Generalized Optimal and Safe Robot Control using Parameter-Conditioned Imitation Learning 

**Authors**: Mumuksh Tayal, Manan Tayal, Ravi Prakash  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12243)  

**Abstract**: Ensuring safe and generalizable control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly when deploying imitation learning in dynamic environments. Traditional behavior cloning (BC) struggles to generalize beyond its training distribution, as it lacks an understanding of the safety critical reasoning behind expert demonstrations. To address this limitation, we propose GenOSIL, a novel imitation learning framework that explicitly incorporates environment parameters into policy learning via a structured latent representation. Unlike conventional methods that treat the environment as a black box, GenOSIL employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode measurable safety parameters such as obstacle position, velocity, and geometry into a latent space that captures intrinsic correlations between expert behavior and environmental constraints. This enables the policy to infer the rationale behind expert trajectories rather than merely replicating them. We validate our approach on two robotic platforms an autonomous ground vehicle and a Franka Emika Panda manipulator demonstrating superior safety and goal reaching performance compared to baseline methods. The simulation and hardware videos can be viewed on the project webpage: this https URL.

# A Novel Double Pruning method for Imbalanced Data using Information Entropy and Roulette Wheel Selection for Breast Cancer Diagnosis 

**Authors**: Soufiane Bacha, Huansheng Ning, Belarbi Mostefa, Doreen Sebastian Sarwatt, Sahraoui Dhelim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12239)  

**Abstract**: Accurate illness diagnosis is vital for effective treatment and patient safety. Machine learning models are widely used for cancer diagnosis based on historical medical data. However, data imbalance remains a major challenge, leading to hindering classifier performance and reliability. The SMOTEBoost method addresses this issue by generating synthetic data to balance the dataset, but it may overlook crucial overlapping regions near the decision boundary and can produce noisy samples. This paper proposes RE-SMOTEBoost, an enhanced version of SMOTEBoost, designed to overcome these limitations. Firstly, RE-SMOTEBoost focuses on generating synthetic samples in overlapping regions to better capture the decision boundary using roulette wheel selection. Secondly, it incorporates a filtering mechanism based on information entropy to reduce noise, and borderline cases and improve the quality of generated data. Thirdly, we introduce a double regularization penalty to control the synthetic samples proximity to the decision boundary and avoid class overlap. These enhancements enable higher-quality oversampling of the minority class, resulting in a more balanced and effective training dataset. The proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques when evaluated on imbalanced datasets. Compared to the top-performing sampling algorithms, RE-SMOTEBoost demonstrates a notable improvement of 3.22\% in accuracy and a variance reduction of 88.8\%. These results indicate that the proposed model offers a solid solution for medical settings, effectively overcoming data scarcity and severe imbalance caused by limited samples, data collection difficulties, and privacy constraints.

# LIAM: Multimodal Transformer for Language Instructions, Images, Actions and Semantic Maps 

**Authors**: Yihao Wang, Raphael Memmesheimer, Sven Behnke  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12230)  

**Abstract**: The availability of large language models and open-vocabulary object perception methods enables more flexibility for domestic service robots. The large variability of domestic tasks can be addressed without implementing each task individually by providing the robot with a task description along with appropriate environment information. In this work, we propose LIAM - an end-to-end model that predicts action transcripts based on language, image, action, and map inputs. Language and image inputs are encoded with a CLIP backbone, for which we designed two pre-training tasks to fine-tune its weights and pre-align the latent spaces. We evaluate our method on the ALFRED dataset, a simulator-generated benchmark for domestic tasks. Our results demonstrate the importance of pre-aligning embedding spaces from different modalities and the efficacy of incorporating semantic maps.

# Adaptive Fault Tolerance Mechanisms of Large Language Models in Cloud Computing Environments 

**Authors**: Yihong Jin, Ze Yang, Xinhe Xu, Yihan Zhang, Shuyang Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12228)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their large-scale experimentation in cloud-computing spaces, the challenge of guaranteeing their security and efficiency in a failure scenario has become a main issue. To ensure the reliability and availability of large-scale language models in cloud computing scenarios, such as frequent resource failures, network problems, and computational overheads, this study proposes a novel adaptive fault tolerance mechanism. It builds upon known fault-tolerant mechanisms, such as checkpointing, redundancy, and state transposition, introducing dynamic resource allocation and prediction of failure based on real-time performance metrics. The hybrid model integrates data driven deep learning-based anomaly detection technique underlining the contribution of cloud orchestration middleware for predictive prevention of system failures. Additionally, the model integrates adaptive checkpointing and recovery strategies that dynamically adapt according to load and system state to minimize the influence on the performance of the model and minimize downtime. The experimental results demonstrate that the designed model considerably enhances the fault tolerance in large-scale cloud surroundings, and decreases the system downtime by $\mathbf{30\%}$, and has a better modeling availability than the classical fault tolerance mechanism.

# Research on Large Language Model Cross-Cloud Privacy Protection and Collaborative Training based on Federated Learning 

**Authors**: Ze Yang, Yihong Jin, Yihan Zhang, Juntian Liu, Xinhe Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12226)  

**Abstract**: The fast development of large language models (LLMs) and popularization of cloud computing have led to increasing concerns on privacy safeguarding and data security of cross-cloud model deployment and training as the key challenges. We present a new framework for addressing these issues along with enabling privacy preserving collaboration on training between distributed clouds based on federated learning. Our mechanism encompasses cutting-edge cryptographic primitives, dynamic model aggregation techniques, and cross-cloud data harmonization solutions to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability to the traditional federated learning paradigm. Furthermore, we proposed a hybrid aggregation scheme to mitigate the threat of Data Leakage and to optimize the aggregation of model updates, thus achieving substantial enhancement on the model effectiveness and stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the training efficiency, privacy protection, and model accuracy of the proposed model compare favorably to those of the traditional federated learning method.

# Evaluation-Time Policy Switching for Offline Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Natinael Solomon Neggatu, Jeremie Houssineau, Giovanni Montana  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12222)  

**Abstract**: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) looks at learning how to optimally solve tasks using a fixed dataset of interactions from the environment. Many off-policy algorithms developed for online learning struggle in the offline setting as they tend to over-estimate the behaviour of out of distributions actions. Existing offline RL algorithms adapt off-policy algorithms, employing techniques such as constraining the policy or modifying the value function to achieve good performance on individual datasets but struggle to adapt to different tasks or datasets of different qualities without tuning hyper-parameters. We introduce a policy switching technique that dynamically combines the behaviour of a pure off-policy RL agent, for improving behaviour, and a behavioural cloning (BC) agent, for staying close to the data. We achieve this by using a combination of epistemic uncertainty, quantified by our RL model, and a metric for aleatoric uncertainty extracted from the dataset. We show empirically that our policy switching technique can outperform not only the individual algorithms used in the switching process but also compete with state-of-the-art methods on numerous benchmarks. Our use of epistemic uncertainty for policy switching also allows us to naturally extend our method to the domain of offline to online fine-tuning allowing our model to adapt quickly and safely from online data, either matching or exceeding the performance of current methods that typically require additional modification or hyper-parameter fine-tuning.

# Changing Base Without Losing Pace: A GPU-Efficient Alternative to MatMul in DNNs 

**Authors**: Nir Ailon, Akhiad Bercovich, Omri Weinstein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12211)  

**Abstract**: We propose a cheaper alternative bilinear operator to matrix-multiplication in deep neural networks (DNNs). Unlike many stubborn attempts to accelerate MatMuls in DNN inference, this operator is supported by capabilities of existing GPU hardware, most notably NVIDIA TensorCores. To our knowledge, this is the first GPU-native acceleration technique which \emph{does not decrease} (in fact, increases) the number of trainable parameters of the network, mitigating the accuracy-loss of compression-based techniques. Hence, this operator is at the same time more expressive than MatMul, yet requires substantially \emph{fewer} FLOPs to evaluate. We term this new operator \emph{Strassen-Tile} (STL).
The main idea behind STL$(X,W)$ is a \emph{local} change-of-basis (learnable encoder) on weights and activation \emph{tiles}, after which we perform batched \emph{elementwise} products between tiles, and a final decoding transformation (inspired by algebraic pipelines from fast matrix and polynomial multiplication).
We compare STL against two benchmarks. The first one is SoTA T2T-ViT on Imagenet-1K. Here we show that replacing \emph{all} linear layers with STL and training from scratch, results in factor x2.7 reduction in FLOPs with a 0.5 \emph{accuracy improvement}. Our second speed-accuracy comparison benchmark for pretrained LLMs is the most practical GPU-acceleration technique, \twofour structured Sparsity. Finetuning TinyLlama \cite{tinyllama24} with STL layers on the Slim Pajama dataset, achieves similar accuracy to 2:4, with x2.2 FLOP speedup compared to x1.7 of the latter.
Finally, we discuss a group-theoretic approach for discovering \emph{universal} encoders for STL, which could lead to fast \emph{black-box} acceleration via approximate matrix-multiplication (AMM).

# Probabilistic Graph Circuits: Deep Generative Models for Tractable Probabilistic Inference over Graphs 

**Authors**: Milan Papež, Martin Rektoris, Václav Šmídl, Tomáš Pevný  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12162)  

**Abstract**: Deep generative models (DGMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in capturing complex probability distributions over graphs. Although their excellent performance is attributed to powerful and scalable deep neural networks, it is, at the same time, exactly the presence of these highly non-linear transformations that makes DGMs intractable. Indeed, despite representing probability distributions, intractable DGMs deny probabilistic foundations by their inability to answer even the most basic inference queries without approximations or design choices specific to a very narrow range of queries. To address this limitation, we propose probabilistic graph circuits (PGCs), a framework of tractable DGMs that provide exact and efficient probabilistic inference over (arbitrary parts of) graphs. Nonetheless, achieving both exactness and efficiency is challenging in the permutation-invariant setting of graphs. We design PGCs that are inherently invariant and satisfy these two requirements, yet at the cost of low expressive power. Therefore, we investigate two alternative strategies to achieve the invariance: the first sacrifices the efficiency, and the second sacrifices the exactness. We demonstrate that ignoring the permutation invariance can have severe consequences in anomaly detection, and that the latter approach is competitive with, and sometimes better than, existing intractable DGMs in the context of molecular graph generation.

# Weighted Graph Structure Learning with Attention Denoising for Node Classification 

**Authors**: Tingting Wang, Jiaxin Su, Haobing Liu, Ruobing Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12157)  

**Abstract**: Node classification in graphs aims to predict the categories of unlabeled nodes by utilizing a small set of labeled nodes. However, weighted graphs often contain noisy edges and anomalous edge weights, which can distort fine-grained relationships between nodes and hinder accurate classification. We propose the Edge Weight-aware Graph Structure Learning (EWGSL) method, which combines weight learning and graph structure learning to address these issues. EWGSL improves node classification by redefining attention coefficients in graph attention networks to incorporate node features and edge weights. It also applies graph structure learning to sparsify attention coefficients and uses a modified InfoNCE loss function to enhance performance by adapting to denoised graph weights. Extensive experimental results show that EWGSL has an average Micro-F1 improvement of 17.8% compared with the best baseline.

# Language Models for Automated Classification of Brain MRI Reports and Growth Chart Generation 

**Authors**: Maryam Daniali, Shivaram Karandikar, Dabriel Zimmerman, J. Eric Schmitt, Matthew J. Buczek, Benjamin Jung, Laura Mercedes, Jakob Seidlitz, Vanessa Troiani, Lena Dorfschmidt, Eren Kafadar, Remo Williams, Susan Sotardi, Arastoo Vosough, Scott Haag, Jenna M. Schabdach, Aaron Alexander-Bloch  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12143)  

**Abstract**: Clinically acquired brain MRIs and radiology reports are valuable but underutilized resources due to the challenges of manual analysis and data heterogeneity. We developed fine-tuned language models (LMs) to classify brain MRI reports as normal (reports with limited pathology) or abnormal, fine-tuning BERT, BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, and RadBERT on 44,661 reports. We also explored the reasoning capabilities of a leading LM, Gemini 1.5-Pro, for normal report categorization. Automated image processing and modeling generated brain growth charts from LM-classified normal scans, comparing them to human-derived charts. Fine-tuned LMs achieved high classification performance (F1-Score >97%), with unbalanced training mitigating class imbalance. Performance was robust on out-of-distribution data, with full text outperforming summary (impression) sections. Gemini 1.5-Pro showed a promising categorization performance, especially with clinical inference. LM-derived brain growth charts were nearly identical to human-annotated charts (r = 0.99, p < 2.2e-16). Our LMs offer scalable analysis of radiology reports, enabling automated classification of brain MRIs in large datasets. One application is automated generation of brain growth charts for benchmarking quantitative image features. Further research is needed to address data heterogeneity and optimize LM reasoning.

# DiffGAP: A Lightweight Diffusion Module in Contrastive Space for Bridging Cross-Model Gap 

**Authors**: Shentong Mo, Zehua Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12131)  

**Abstract**: Recent works in cross-modal understanding and generation, notably through models like CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) and CAVP (Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining), have significantly enhanced the alignment of text, video, and audio embeddings via a single contrastive loss. However, these methods often overlook the bidirectional interactions and inherent noises present in each modality, which can crucially impact the quality and efficacy of cross-modal integration. To address this limitation, we introduce DiffGAP, a novel approach incorporating a lightweight generative module within the contrastive space. Specifically, our DiffGAP employs a bidirectional diffusion process tailored to bridge the cross-modal gap more effectively. This involves a denoising process on text and video embeddings conditioned on audio embeddings and vice versa, thus facilitating a more nuanced and robust cross-modal interaction. Our experimental results on VGGSound and AudioCaps datasets demonstrate that DiffGAP significantly improves performance in video/text-audio generation and retrieval tasks, confirming its effectiveness in enhancing cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.

# Hyperbolic Safety-Aware Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Tobia Poppi, Tejaswi Kasarla, Pascal Mettes, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12127)  

**Abstract**: Addressing the retrieval of unsafe content from vision-language models such as CLIP is an important step towards real-world integration. Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only enhances safety recognition but also establishes a more adaptable and interpretable framework for content moderation in vision-language models.

# Robust Isolation Forest using Soft Sparse Random Projection and Valley Emphasis Method 

**Authors**: Hun Kang, Kyoungok Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12125)  

**Abstract**: Isolation Forest (iForest) is an unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm designed to effectively detect anomalies under the assumption that anomalies are ``few and different." Various studies have aimed to enhance iForest, but the resulting algorithms often exhibited significant performance disparities across datasets. Additionally, the challenge of isolating rare and widely distributed anomalies persisted in research focused on improving splits. To address these challenges, we introduce Robust iForest (RiForest). RiForest leverages both existing features and random hyperplanes obtained through soft sparse random projection to identify superior split features for anomaly detection, independent of datasets. It utilizes the underutilized valley emphasis method for optimal split point determination and incorporates sparsity randomization in soft sparse random projection for enhanced anomaly detection robustness. Across 24 benchmark datasets, experiments demonstrate RiForest's consistent outperformance of existing algorithms in anomaly detection, emphasizing stability and robustness to noise variables.

# MT-RewardTree: A Comprehensive Framework for Advancing LLM-Based Machine Translation via Reward Modeling 

**Authors**: Zhaopeng Feng, Jiahan Ren, Jiayuan Su, Jiamei Zheng, Zhihang Tang, Hongwei Wang, Zuozhu Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12123)  

**Abstract**: Process reward models (PRMs) have shown success in complex reasoning tasks for large language models (LLMs). However, their application to machine translation (MT) remains underexplored due to the lack of systematic methodologies and evaluation benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{MT-RewardTree}, a comprehensive framework for constructing, evaluating, and deploying process reward models in MT. Unlike traditional vanilla preference pair construction, we propose a novel method for automatically generating token-level preference pairs using approximate Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which mitigates the prohibitive cost of human annotation for fine-grained steps. Then, we establish the first MT-specific reward model benchmark and provide a systematic comparison of different reward modeling architectures, revealing that token-level supervision effectively captures fine-grained preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our MT-PRM-Qwen-2.5-3B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both token-level and sequence-level evaluation given the same input prefix. Furthermore, we showcase practical applications where PRMs enable test-time alignment for LLMs without additional alignment training and significantly improve performance in hypothesis ensembling. Our work provides valuable insights into the role of reward models in MT research. Our code and data are released in \href{this https URL}{this https URL\_RewardTreePage}.

# ICCO: Learning an Instruction-conditioned Coordinator for Language-guided Task-aligned Multi-robot Control 

**Authors**: Yoshiki Yano, Kazuki Shibata, Maarten Kokshoorn, Takamitsu Matsubara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12122)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have permitted the development of language-guided multi-robot systems, which allow robots to execute tasks based on natural language instructions. However, achieving effective coordination in distributed multi-agent environments remains challenging due to (1) misalignment between instructions and task requirements and (2) inconsistency in robot behaviors when they independently interpret ambiguous instructions. To address these challenges, we propose Instruction-Conditioned Coordinator (ICCO), a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework designed to enhance coordination in language-guided multi-robot systems. ICCO consists of a Coordinator agent and multiple Local Agents, where the Coordinator generates Task-Aligned and Consistent Instructions (TACI) by integrating language instructions with environmental states, ensuring task alignment and behavioral consistency. The Coordinator and Local Agents are jointly trained to optimize a reward function that balances task efficiency and instruction following. A Consistency Enhancement Term is added to the learning objective to maximize mutual information between instructions and robot behaviors, further improving coordination. Simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of ICCO in achieving language-guided task-aligned multi-robot control. The demonstration can be found at this https URL.

# Universal Speech Token Learning via Low-Bitrate Neural Codec and Pretrained Representations 

**Authors**: Xue Jiang, Xiulian Peng, Yuan Zhang, Yan Lu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12115)  

**Abstract**: Current large speech language models are mainly based on semantic tokens from discretization of self-supervised learned representations and acoustic tokens from a neural codec, following a semantic-modeling and acoustic-synthesis paradigm. However, semantic tokens discard paralinguistic attributes of speakers that is important for natural spoken communication, while prompt-based acoustic synthesis from semantic tokens has limits in recovering paralinguistic details and suffers from robustness issues, especially when there are domain gaps between the prompt and the target. This paper unifies two types of tokens and proposes the UniCodec, a universal speech token learning that encapsulates all semantics of speech, including linguistic and paralinguistic information, into a compact and semantically-disentangled unified token. Such a unified token can not only benefit speech language models in understanding with paralinguistic hints but also help speech generation with high-quality output. A low-bitrate neural codec is leveraged to learn such disentangled discrete representations at global and local scales, with knowledge distilled from self-supervised learned features. Extensive evaluations on multilingual datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in generating natural, expressive and long-term consistent output quality with paralinguistic attributes well preserved in several speech processing tasks.

# RECSIP: REpeated Clustering of Scores Improving the Precision 

**Authors**: André Schamschurko, Nenad Petrovic, Alois Christian Knoll  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12108)  

**Abstract**: The latest research on Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, despite this progress, there is still a lack of reliability in these models. This is due to the stochastic architecture of LLMs, which presents a challenge for users attempting to ascertain the reliability of a model's response. These responses may cause serious harm in high-risk environments or expensive failures in industrial contexts. Therefore, we introduce the framework REpeated Clustering of Scores Improving the Precision (RECSIP) which focuses on improving the precision of LLMs by asking multiple models in parallel, scoring and clustering their responses to ensure a higher reliability on the response. The evaluation of our reference implementation recsip on the benchmark MMLU-Pro using the models GPT-4o, Claude and Gemini shows an overall increase of 5.8 per cent points compared to the best used model.

# ChronosX: Adapting Pretrained Time Series Models with Exogenous Variables 

**Authors**: Sebastian Pineda Arango, Pedro Mercado, Shubham Kapoor, Abdul Fatir Ansari, Lorenzo Stella, Huibin Shen, Hugo Senetaire, Caner Turkmen, Oleksandr Shchur, Danielle C. Maddix, Michael Bohlke-Schneider, Yuyang Wang, Syama Sundar Rangapuram  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12107)  

**Abstract**: Covariates provide valuable information on external factors that influence time series and are critical in many real-world time series forecasting tasks. For example, in retail, covariates may indicate promotions or peak dates such as holiday seasons that heavily influence demand forecasts. Recent advances in pretraining large language model architectures for time series forecasting have led to highly accurate forecasters. However, the majority of these models do not readily use covariates as they are often specific to a certain task or domain. This paper introduces a new method to incorporate covariates into pretrained time series forecasting models. Our proposed approach incorporates covariate information into pretrained forecasting models through modular blocks that inject past and future covariate information, without necessarily modifying the pretrained model in consideration. In order to evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark composed of 32 different synthetic datasets with varying dynamics to evaluate the effectivity of forecasting models with covariates. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets show that our approach effectively incorporates covariate information into pretrained models, outperforming existing baselines.

# Comparing Human Expertise and Large Language Models Embeddings in Content Validity Assessment of Personality Tests 

**Authors**: Nicola Milano, Michela Ponticorvo, Davide Marocco  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12080)  

**Abstract**: In this article we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in assessing the content validity of psychometric instruments, focusing on the Big Five Questionnaire (BFQ) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). Content validity, a cornerstone of test construction, ensures that psychological measures adequately cover their intended constructs. Using both human expert evaluations and advanced LLMs, we compared the accuracy of semantic item-construct alignment. Graduate psychology students employed the Content Validity Ratio (CVR) to rate test items, forming the human baseline. In parallel, state-of-the-art LLMs, including multilingual and fine-tuned models, analyzed item embeddings to predict construct mappings. The results reveal distinct strengths and limitations of human and AI approaches. Human validators excelled in aligning the behaviorally rich BFQ items, while LLMs performed better with the linguistically concise BFI items. Training strategies significantly influenced LLM performance, with models tailored for lexical relationships outperforming general-purpose LLMs. Here we highlights the complementary potential of hybrid validation systems that integrate human expertise and AI precision. The findings underscore the transformative role of LLMs in psychological assessment, paving the way for scalable, objective, and robust test development methodologies.

# V-Stylist: Video Stylization via Collaboration and Reflection of MLLM Agents 

**Authors**: Zhengrong Yue, Shaobin Zhuang, Kunchang Li, Yanbo Ding, Yali Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12077)  

**Abstract**: Despite the recent advancement in video stylization, most existing methods struggle to render any video with complex transitions, based on an open style description of user query. To fill this gap, we introduce a generic multi-agent system for video stylization, V-Stylist, by a novel collaboration and reflection paradigm of multi-modal large language models. Specifically, our V-Stylist is a systematical workflow with three key roles: (1) Video Parser decomposes the input video into a number of shots and generates their text prompts of key shot content. Via a concise video-to-shot prompting paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to effectively handle videos with complex transitions. (2) Style Parser identifies the style in the user query and progressively search the matched style model from a style tree. Via a robust tree-of-thought searching paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to precisely specify vague style preference in the open user query. (3) Style Artist leverages the matched model to render all the video shots into the required style. Via a novel multi-round self-reflection paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to adaptively adjust detail control, according to the style requirement. With such a distinct design of mimicking human professionals, our V-Stylist achieves a major breakthrough over the primary challenges for effective and automatic video stylization. Moreover,we further construct a new benchmark Text-driven Video Stylization Benchmark (TVSBench), which fills the gap to assess stylization of complex videos on open user queries. Extensive experiments show that, V-Stylist achieves the state-of-the-art, e.g.,V-Stylist surpasses FRESCO and ControlVideo by 6.05% and 4.51% respectively in overall average metrics, marking a significant advance in video stylization.

# Maritime Mission Planning for Unmanned Surface Vessel using Large Language Model 

**Authors**: Muhayy Ud Din, Waseem Akram, Ahsan B Bakht, Yihao Dong, Irfan Hussain  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12065)  

**Abstract**: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) are essential for various maritime operations. USV mission planning approach offers autonomous solutions for monitoring, surveillance, and logistics. Existing approaches, which are based on static methods, struggle to adapt to dynamic environments, leading to suboptimal performance, higher costs, and increased risk of failure. This paper introduces a novel mission planning framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, to address these challenges. LLMs are proficient at understanding natural language commands, executing symbolic reasoning, and flexibly adjusting to changing situations. Our approach integrates LLMs into maritime mission planning to bridge the gap between high-level human instructions and executable plans, allowing real-time adaptation to environmental changes and unforeseen obstacles. In addition, feedback from low-level controllers is utilized to refine symbolic mission plans, ensuring robustness and adaptability. This framework improves the robustness and effectiveness of USV operations by integrating the power of symbolic planning with the reasoning abilities of LLMs. In addition, it simplifies the mission specification, allowing operators to focus on high-level objectives without requiring complex programming. The simulation results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to optimize mission execution while seamlessly adapting to dynamic maritime conditions.

# Revisiting Training-Inference Trigger Intensity in Backdoor Attacks 

**Authors**: Chenhao Lin, Chenyang Zhao, Shiwei Wang, Longtian Wang, Chao Shen, Zhengyu Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12058)  

**Abstract**: Backdoor attacks typically place a specific trigger on certain training data, such that the model makes prediction errors on inputs with that trigger during inference. Despite the core role of the trigger, existing studies have commonly believed a perfect match between training-inference triggers is optimal. In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore the training-inference trigger relation, particularly focusing on their mismatch, based on a Training-Inference Trigger Intensity Manipulation (TITIM) workflow. TITIM specifically investigates the training-inference trigger intensity, such as the size or the opacity of a trigger, and reveals new insights into trigger generalization and overfitting.
These new insights challenge the above common belief by demonstrating that the training-inference trigger mismatch can facilitate attacks in two practical scenarios, posing more significant security threats than previously thought. First, when the inference trigger is fixed, using training triggers with mixed intensities leads to stronger attacks than using any single intensity. For example, on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18, mixing training triggers with 1.0 and 0.1 opacities improves the worst-case attack success rate (ASR) (over different testing opacities) of the best single-opacity attack from 10.61\% to 92.77\%. Second, intentionally using certain mismatched training-inference triggers can improve the attack stealthiness, i.e., better bypassing defenses. For example, compared to the training/inference intensity of 1.0/1.0, using 1.0/0.7 decreases the area under the curve (AUC) of the Scale-Up defense from 0.96 to 0.62, while maintaining a high attack ASR (99.65\% vs. 91.62\%). The above new insights are validated to be generalizable across different backdoor attacks, models, datasets, tasks, and (digital/physical) domains.

# Ferret: An Efficient Online Continual Learning Framework under Varying Memory Constraints 

**Authors**: Yuhao Zhou, Yuxin Tian, Jindi Lv, Mingjia Shi, Yuanxi Li, Qing Ye, Shuhao Zhang, Jiancheng Lv  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12053)  

**Abstract**: In the realm of high-frequency data streams, achieving real-time learning within varying memory constraints is paramount. This paper presents Ferret, a comprehensive framework designed to enhance online accuracy of Online Continual Learning (OCL) algorithms while dynamically adapting to varying memory budgets. Ferret employs a fine-grained pipeline parallelism strategy combined with an iterative gradient compensation algorithm, ensuring seamless handling of high-frequency data with minimal latency, and effectively counteracting the challenge of stale gradients in parallel training. To adapt to varying memory budgets, its automated model partitioning and pipeline planning optimizes performance regardless of memory limitations. Extensive experiments across 20 benchmarks and 5 integrated OCL algorithms show Ferret's remarkable efficiency, achieving up to 3.7$\times$ lower memory overhead to reach the same online accuracy compared to competing methods. Furthermore, Ferret consistently outperforms these methods across diverse memory budgets, underscoring its superior adaptability. These findings position Ferret as a premier solution for efficient and adaptive OCL framework in real-time environments.

# An LLM-Integrated Framework for Completion, Management, and Tracing of STPA 

**Authors**: Ali Raeisdanaei, Juho Kim, Michael Liao, Sparsh Kochhar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12043)  

**Abstract**: In many safety-critical engineering domains, hazard analysis techniques are an essential part of requirement elicitation. Of the methods proposed for this task, STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis) represents a relatively recent development in the field. The completion, management, and traceability of this hazard analysis technique present a time-consuming challenge to the requirements and safety engineers involved. In this paper, we introduce a free, open-source software framework to build STPA models with several automated workflows powered by large language models (LLMs). In past works, LLMs have been successfully integrated into a myriad of workflows across various fields. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can be used to complete tasks associated with STPA with a high degree of accuracy, saving the time and effort of the human engineers involved. We experimentally validate our method on real-world STPA models built by requirement engineers and researchers. The source code of our software framework is available at the following link: this https URL.

# Unsupervised Graph Anomaly Detection via Multi-Hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning 

**Authors**: Hang Ni, Jindong Han, Nengjun Zhu, Hao Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12037)  

**Abstract**: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) plays a vital role in various data mining applications such as e-commerce fraud prevention and malicious user detection. Recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach has demonstrated great effectiveness in GAD by first encoding graph data into low-dimensional representations and then identifying anomalies under the guidance of supervised or unsupervised signals. However, existing GNN-based approaches implicitly follow the homophily principle (i.e., the "like attracts like" phenomenon) and fail to learn discriminative embedding for anomalies that connect vast normal nodes. Moreover, such approaches identify anomalies in a unified global perspective but overlook diversified abnormal patterns conditioned on local graph context, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we propose a Multi-hypersphere Heterophilic Graph Learning (MHetGL) framework for unsupervised GAD. Specifically, we first devise a Heterophilic Graph Encoding (HGE) module to learn distinguishable representations for potential anomalies by purifying and augmenting their neighborhood in a fully unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a Multi-Hypersphere Learning (MHL) module to enhance the detection capability for context-dependent anomalies by jointly incorporating critical patterns from both global and local perspectives. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets show that MHetGL outperforms 14 baselines. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Enes Erdogan, Eren Erdal Aksoy, Sanem Sariel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12034)  

**Abstract**: Recognition of human manipulation actions in real-time is essential for safe and effective human-robot interaction and collaboration. The challenge lies in developing a model that is both lightweight enough for real-time execution and capable of generalization. While some existing methods in the literature can run in real-time, they struggle with temporal scalability, i.e., they fail to adapt to long-duration manipulations effectively. To address this, leveraging the generalizable scene graph representations, we propose a new Factorized Graph Sequence Encoder network that not only runs in real-time but also scales effectively in the temporal dimension, thanks to its factorized encoder architecture. Additionally, we introduce Hand Pooling operation, a simple pooling operation for more focused extraction of the graph-level embeddings. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art real-time approach, achieving a 14.3\% and 5.6\% improvement in F1-macro score on the KIT Bimanual Action (Bimacs) Dataset and Collaborative Action (CoAx) Dataset, respectively. Moreover, we conduct an extensive ablation study to validate our network design choices. Finally, we compare our model with its architecturally similar RGB-based model on the Bimacs dataset and show the limitations of this model in contrast to ours on such an object-centric manipulation dataset.

# Variance-Dependent Regret Lower Bounds for Contextual Bandits 

**Authors**: Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12020)  

**Abstract**: Variance-dependent regret bounds for linear contextual bandits, which improve upon the classical $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{K})$ regret bound to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2})$, where $d$ is the context dimension, $K$ is the number of rounds, and $\sigma^2_k$ is the noise variance in round $k$, has been widely studied in recent years. However, most existing works focus on the regret upper bounds instead of lower bounds. To our knowledge, the only lower bound is from Jia et al. (2024), which proved that for any eluder dimension $d_{\textbf{elu}}$ and total variance budget $\Lambda$, there exists an instance with $\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2\leq \Lambda$ for which any algorithm incurs a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{d_{\textbf{elu}}\Lambda})$. However, this lower bound has a $\sqrt{d}$ gap with existing upper bounds. Moreover, it only considers a fixed total variance budget $\Lambda$ and does not apply to a general variance sequence $\{\sigma_1^2,\ldots,\sigma_K^2\}$. In this paper, to overcome the limitations of Jia et al. (2024), we consider the general variance sequence under two settings. For a prefixed sequence, where the entire variance sequence is revealed to the learner at the beginning of the learning process, we establish a variance-dependent lower bound of $\Omega(d \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2 }/\log K)$ for linear contextual bandits. For an adaptive sequence, where an adversary can generate the variance $\sigma_k^2$ in each round $k$ based on historical observations, we show that when the adversary must generate $\sigma_k^2$ before observing the decision set $\mathcal{D}_k$, a similar lower bound of $\Omega(d\sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^K\sigma_k^2} /\log^6(dK))$ holds. In both settings, our results match the upper bounds of the SAVE algorithm (Zhao et al., 2023) up to logarithmic factors.

# Compose Your Aesthetics: Empowering Text-to-Image Models with the Principles of Art 

**Authors**: Zhe Jin, Tat-Seng Chua  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12018)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models (DM) have garnered widespread adoption due to their capability in generating high-fidelity outputs and accessibility to anyone able to put imagination into words. However, DMs are often predisposed to generate unappealing outputs, much like the random images on the internet they were trained on. Existing approaches to address this are founded on the implicit premise that visual aesthetics is universal, which is limiting. Aesthetics in the T2I context should be about personalization and we propose the novel task of aesthetics alignment which seeks to align user-specified aesthetics with the T2I generation output. Inspired by how artworks provide an invaluable perspective to approach aesthetics, we codify visual aesthetics using the compositional framework artists employ, known as the Principles of Art (PoA). To facilitate this study, we introduce CompArt, a large-scale compositional art dataset building on top of WikiArt with PoA analysis annotated by a capable Multimodal LLM. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and training a lightweight and transferrable adapter, we demonstrate that T2I DMs can effectively offer 10 compositional controls through user-specified PoA conditions. Additionally, we design an appropriate evaluation framework to assess the efficacy of our approach.

# Winning the MIDST Challenge: New Membership Inference Attacks on Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Synthesis 

**Authors**: Xiaoyu Wu, Yifei Pang, Terrance Liu, Steven Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.12008)  

**Abstract**: Tabular data synthesis using diffusion models has gained significant attention for its potential to balance data utility and privacy. However, existing privacy evaluations often rely on heuristic metrics or weak membership inference attacks (MIA), leaving privacy risks inadequately assessed. In this work, we conduct a rigorous MIA study on diffusion-based tabular synthesis, revealing that state-of-the-art attacks designed for image models fail in this setting. We identify noise initialization as a key factor influencing attack efficacy and propose a machine-learning-driven approach that leverages loss features across different noises and time steps. Our method, implemented with a lightweight MLP, effectively learns membership signals, eliminating the need for manual optimization. Experimental results from the MIDST Challenge @ SaTML 2025 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, securing first place across all tracks. Code is available at this https URL.

# Fraesormer: Learning Adaptive Sparse Transformer for Efficient Food Recognition 

**Authors**: Shun Zou, Yi Zou, Mingya Zhang, Shipeng Luo, Zhihao Chen, Guangwei Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11995)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, Transformer has witnessed significant progress in food recognition. However, most existing approaches still face two critical challenges in lightweight food recognition: (1) the quadratic complexity and redundant feature representation from interactions with irrelevant tokens; (2) static feature recognition and single-scale representation, which overlook the unstructured, non-fixed nature of food images and the need for multi-scale features. To address these, we propose an adaptive and efficient sparse Transformer architecture (Fraesormer) with two core designs: Adaptive Top-k Sparse Partial Attention (ATK-SPA) and Hierarchical Scale-Sensitive Feature Gating Network (HSSFGN). ATK-SPA uses a learnable Gated Dynamic Top-K Operator (GDTKO) to retain critical attention scores, filtering low query-key matches that hinder feature aggregation. It also introduces a partial channel mechanism to reduce redundancy and promote expert information flow, enabling local-global collaborative modeling. HSSFGN employs gating mechanism to achieve multi-scale feature representation, enhancing contextual semantic information. Extensive experiments show that Fraesormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. code is available at this https URL.

# Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation 

**Authors**: Dharani Chandra  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11989)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.

# No LLM is Free From Bias: A Comprehensive Study of Bias Evaluation in Large Language models 

**Authors**: Charaka Vinayak Kumar, Ashok Urlana, Gopichand Kanumolu, Bala Mallikarjunarao Garlapati, Pruthwik Mishra  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11985)  

**Abstract**: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the performance of different natural language understanding as well as generation tasks. Although LLMs have breached the state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they often reflect different forms of bias present in the training data. In the light of this perceived limitation, we provide a unified evaluation of benchmarks using a set of representative LLMs that cover different forms of biases starting from physical characteristics to socio-economic categories. Moreover, we propose five prompting approaches to carry out the bias detection task across different aspects of bias. Further, we formulate three research questions to gain valuable insight in detecting biases in LLMs using different approaches and evaluation metrics across benchmarks. The results indicate that each of the selected LLMs suffer from one or the other form of bias with the LLaMA3.1-8B model being the least biased. Finally, we conclude the paper with the identification of key challenges and possible future directions.

# HInter: Exposing Hidden Intersectional Bias in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Badr Souani, Ezekiel Soremekun, Mike Papadakis, Setsuko Yokoyama, Sudipta Chattopadhyay, Yves Le Traon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11962)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) may portray discrimination towards certain individuals, especially those characterized by multiple attributes (aka intersectional bias). Discovering intersectional bias in LLMs is challenging, as it involves complex inputs on multiple attributes (e.g. race and gender). To address this challenge, we propose HInter, a test technique that synergistically combines mutation analysis, dependency parsing and metamorphic oracles to automatically detect intersectional bias in LLMs. HInter generates test inputs by systematically mutating sentences using multiple mutations, validates inputs via a dependency invariant and detects biases by checking the LLM response on the original and mutated sentences. We evaluate HInter using six LLM architectures and 18 LLM models (GPT3.5, Llama2, BERT, etc) and find that 14.61% of the inputs generated by HInter expose intersectional bias. Results also show that our dependency invariant reduces false positives (incorrect test inputs) by an order of magnitude. Finally, we observed that 16.62% of intersectional bias errors are hidden, meaning that their corresponding atomic cases do not trigger biases. Overall, this work emphasize the importance of testing LLMs for intersectional bias.

# CHOrD: Generation of Collision-Free, House-Scale, and Organized Digital Twins for 3D Indoor Scenes with Controllable Floor Plans and Optimal Layouts 

**Authors**: Chong Su, Yingbin Fu, Zheyuan Hu, Jing Yang, Param Hanji, Shaojun Wang, Xuan Zhao, Cengiz Öztireli, Fangcheng Zhong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11958)  

**Abstract**: We introduce CHOrD, a novel framework for scalable synthesis of 3D indoor scenes, designed to create house-scale, collision-free, and hierarchically structured indoor digital twins. In contrast to existing methods that directly synthesize the scene layout as a scene graph or object list, CHOrD incorporates a 2D image-based intermediate layout representation, enabling effective prevention of collision artifacts by successfully capturing them as out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios during generation. Furthermore, unlike existing methods, CHOrD is capable of generating scene layouts that adhere to complex floor plans with multi-modal controls, enabling the creation of coherent, house-wide layouts robust to both geometric and semantic variations in room structures. Additionally, we propose a novel dataset with expanded coverage of household items and room configurations, as well as significantly improved data quality. CHOrD demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the 3D-FRONT and our proposed datasets, delivering photorealistic, spatially coherent indoor scene synthesis adaptable to arbitrary floor plan variations.

# Goal-Oriented Source Coding using LDPC Codes for Compressed-Domain Image Classification 

**Authors**: Ahcen Aliouat, Elsa Dupraz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11954)  

**Abstract**: In the emerging field of goal-oriented communications, the focus has shifted from reconstructing data to directly performing specific learning tasks, such as classification, segmentation, or pattern recognition, on the received coded data. In the commonly studied scenario of classification from compressed images, a key objective is to enable learning directly on entropy-coded data, thereby bypassing the computationally intensive step of data reconstruction. Conventional entropy-coding methods, such as Huffman and Arithmetic coding, are effective for compression but disrupt the data structure, making them less suitable for direct learning without decoding. This paper investigates the use of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes -- originally designed for channel coding -- as an alternative entropy-coding approach. It is hypothesized that the structured nature of LDPC codes can be leveraged more effectively by deep learning models for tasks like classification. At the receiver side, gated recurrent unit (GRU) models are trained to perform image classification directly on LDPC-coded data. Experiments on datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR show that LDPC codes outperform Huffman and Arithmetic coding in classification tasks, while requiring significantly smaller learning models. Furthermore, the paper analyzes why LDPC codes preserve data structure more effectively than traditional entropy-coding techniques and explores the impact of key code parameters on classification performance. These results suggest that LDPC-based entropy coding offers an optimal balance between learning efficiency and model complexity, eliminating the need for prior decoding.

**Authors**: Ankur Barthwal, Molly Campbell, Ajay Kumar Shrestha  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11950)  

**Abstract**: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital ecosystems has reshaped privacy dynamics, particularly for young digital citizens navigating data-driven environments. This study explores evolving privacy concerns across three key stakeholder groups, digital citizens (ages 16-19), parents, educators, and AI professionals, and assesses differences in data ownership, trust, transparency, parental mediation, education, and risk-benefit perceptions. Employing a grounded theory methodology, this research synthesizes insights from 482 participants through structured surveys, qualitative interviews, and focus groups. The findings reveal distinct privacy expectations- Young users emphasize autonomy and digital freedom, while parents and educators advocate for regulatory oversight and AI literacy programs. AI professionals, in contrast, prioritize the balance between ethical system design and technological efficiency. The data further highlights gaps in AI literacy and transparency, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, stakeholder-driven privacy frameworks that accommodate diverse user needs. Using comparative thematic analysis, this study identifies key tensions in privacy governance and develops the novel Privacy-Ethics Alignment in AI (PEA-AI) model, which structures privacy decision-making as a dynamic negotiation between stakeholders. By systematically analyzing themes such as transparency, user control, risk perception, and parental mediation, this research provides a scalable, adaptive foundation for AI governance, ensuring that privacy protections evolve alongside emerging AI technologies and youth-centric digital interactions.

# Integration of Explainable AI Techniques with Large Language Models for Enhanced Interpretability for Sentiment Analysis 

**Authors**: Thivya Thogesan, Anupiya Nugaliyadde, Kok Wai Wong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11948)  

**Abstract**: Interpretability remains a key difficulty in sentiment analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in high-stakes applications where it is crucial to comprehend the rationale behind forecasts. This research addressed this by introducing a technique that applies SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) by breaking down LLMs into components such as embedding layer,encoder,decoder and attention layer to provide a layer-by-layer knowledge of sentiment prediction. The approach offers a clearer overview of how model interpret and categorise sentiment by breaking down LLMs into these parts. The method is evaluated using the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) dataset, which shows how different sentences affect different layers. The effectiveness of layer-wise SHAP analysis in clarifying sentiment-specific token attributions is demonstrated by experimental evaluations, which provide a notable enhancement over current whole-model explainability techniques. These results highlight how the suggested approach could improve the reliability and transparency of LLM-based sentiment analysis in crucial applications.

**Authors**: Austin Shouli, Ankur Barthwal, Molly Campbell, Ajay Kumar Shrestha  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11947)  

**Abstract**: The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in digital platforms used by youth has created significant challenges related to privacy, autonomy, and data protection. While AI-driven personalization offers enhanced user experiences, it often operates without clear ethical boundaries, leaving young users vulnerable to data exploitation and algorithmic biases. This paper presents a call to action for ethical AI governance, advocating for a structured framework that ensures youth-centred privacy protections, transparent data practices, and regulatory oversight. We outline key areas requiring urgent intervention, including algorithmic transparency, privacy education, parental data-sharing ethics, and accountability measures. Through this approach, we seek to empower youth with greater control over their digital identities and propose actionable strategies for policymakers, AI developers, and educators to build a fairer and more accountable AI ecosystem.

# Human Digital Twins in Personalized Healthcare: An Overview and Future Perspectives 

**Authors**: Melvin Mokhtari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11944)  

**Abstract**: Digital twins (DTs) are redefining healthcare by paving the way for more personalized, proactive, and intelligent medical interventions. As the shift toward personalized care intensifies, there is a growing need for an individual's virtual replica that delivers the right treatment at the optimal time and in the most effective manner. The emerging concept of a Human Digital Twin (HDT) holds the potential to revolutionize the traditional healthcare system much like digital twins have transformed manufacturing and aviation. An HDT mirrors the physical entity of a human body through a dynamic virtual model that continuously reflects changes in molecular, physiological, emotional, and lifestyle factors. This digital representation not only supports remote monitoring, diagnosis, and prescription but also facilitates surgery, rehabilitation, and overall personalized care, thereby relieving pressure on conventional healthcare frameworks. Despite its promising advantages, there are considerable research challenges to overcome as HDT technology evolves. In this study, I will initially delineate the distinctions between traditional digital twins and HDTs, followed by an exploration of the networking architecture integral to their operation--from data acquisition and communication to computation, management, and decision-making--thereby offering insights into how these innovations may reshape the modern healthcare industry.

# Att-Adapter: A Robust and Precise Domain-Specific Multi-Attributes T2I Diffusion Adapter via Conditional Variational Autoencoder 

**Authors**: Wonwoong Cho, Yan-Ying Chen, Matthew Klenk, David I. Inouye, Yanxia Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11937)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-Image (T2I) Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable performance in generating high quality images. However, enabling precise control of continuous attributes, especially multiple attributes simultaneously, in a new domain (e.g., numeric values like eye openness or car width) with text-only guidance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Attribute (Att) Adapter, a novel plug-and-play module designed to enable fine-grained, multi-attributes control in pretrained diffusion models. Our approach learns a single control adapter from a set of sample images that can be unpaired and contain multiple visual attributes. The Att-Adapter leverages the decoupled cross attention module to naturally harmonize the multiple domain attributes with text conditioning. We further introduce Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to the Att-Adapter to mitigate overfitting, matching the diverse nature of the visual world. Evaluations on two public datasets show that Att-Adapter outperforms all LoRA-based baselines in controlling continuous attributes. Additionally, our method enables a broader control range and also improves disentanglement across multiple attributes, surpassing StyleGAN-based techniques. Notably, Att-Adapter is flexible, requiring no paired synthetic data for training, and is easily scalable to multiple attributes within a single model.

# End-to-End Edge AI Service Provisioning Framework in 6G ORAN 

**Authors**: Yun Tang, Udhaya Chandhar Srinivasan, Benjamin James Scott, Obumneme Umealor, Dennis Kevogo, Weisi Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11933)  

**Abstract**: With the advent of 6G, Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architectures are evolving to support intelligent, adaptive, and automated network orchestration. This paper proposes a novel Edge AI and Network Service Orchestration framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents deployed as O-RAN rApps. The proposed LLM-agent-powered system enables interactive and intuitive orchestration by translating the user's use case description into deployable AI services and corresponding network configurations. The LLM agent automates multiple tasks, including AI model selection from repositories (e.g., Hugging Face), service deployment, network adaptation, and real-time monitoring via xApps. We implement a prototype using open-source O-RAN projects (OpenAirInterface and FlexRIC) to demonstrate the feasibility and functionality of our framework. Our demonstration showcases the end-to-end flow of AI service orchestration, from user interaction to network adaptation, ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) compliance. This work highlights the potential of integrating LLM-driven automation into 6G O-RAN ecosystems, paving the way for more accessible and efficient edge AI ecosystems.

# REGEN: A Dataset and Benchmarks with Natural Language Critiques and Narratives 

**Authors**: Kun Su, Krishna Sayana, Hubert Pham, James Pine, Yuri Vasilevski, Raghavendra Vasudeva, Marialena Kyriakidi, Liam Hebert, Ambarish Jash, Anushya Subbiah, Sukhdeep Sodhi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11924)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel dataset REGEN (Reviews Enhanced with GEnerative Narratives), designed to benchmark the conversational capabilities of recommender Large Language Models (LLMs), addressing the limitations of existing datasets that primarily focus on sequential item prediction. REGEN extends the Amazon Product Reviews dataset by inpainting two key natural language features: (1) user critiques, representing user "steering" queries that lead to the selection of a subsequent item, and (2) narratives, rich textual outputs associated with each recommended item taking into account prior context. The narratives include product endorsements, purchase explanations, and summaries of user preferences.
Further, we establish an end-to-end modeling benchmark for the task of conversational recommendation, where models are trained to generate both recommendations and corresponding narratives conditioned on user history (items and critiques). For this joint task, we introduce a modeling framework LUMEN (LLM-based Unified Multi-task Model with Critiques, Recommendations, and Narratives) which uses an LLM as a backbone for critiquing, retrieval and generation. We also evaluate the dataset's quality using standard auto-rating techniques and benchmark it by training both traditional and LLM-based recommender models. Our results demonstrate that incorporating critiques enhances recommendation quality by enabling the recommender to learn language understanding and integrate it with recommendation signals. Furthermore, LLMs trained on our dataset effectively generate both recommendations and contextual narratives, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art recommenders and language models.

# Sketch-to-Skill: Bootstrapping Robot Learning with Human Drawn Trajectory Sketches 

**Authors**: Peihong Yu, Amisha Bhaskar, Anukriti Singh, Zahiruddin Mahammad, Pratap Tokekar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11918)  

**Abstract**: Training robotic manipulation policies traditionally requires numerous demonstrations and/or environmental rollouts. While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.

# A Framework for Evaluating Emerging Cyberattack Capabilities of AI 

**Authors**: Mikel Rodriguez, Raluca Ada Popa, Four Flynn, Lihao Liang, Allan Dafoe, Anna Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11917)  

**Abstract**: As frontier models become more capable, the community has attempted to evaluate their ability to enable cyberattacks. Performing a comprehensive evaluation and prioritizing defenses are crucial tasks in preparing for AGI safely. However, current cyber evaluation efforts are ad-hoc, with no systematic reasoning about the various phases of attacks, and do not provide a steer on how to use targeted defenses. In this work, we propose a novel approach to AI cyber capability evaluation that (1) examines the end-to-end attack chain, (2) helps to identify gaps in the evaluation of AI threats, and (3) helps defenders prioritize targeted mitigations and conduct AI-enabled adversary emulation to support red teaming. To achieve these goals, we propose adapting existing cyberattack chain frameworks to AI systems. We analyze over 12,000 instances of real-world attempts to use AI in cyberattacks catalogued by Google's Threat Intelligence Group. Using this analysis, we curate a representative collection of seven cyberattack chain archetypes and conduct a bottleneck analysis to identify areas of potential AI-driven cost disruption. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 50 new challenges spanning different phases of cyberattacks. Based on this, we devise targeted cybersecurity model evaluations, report on the potential for AI to amplify offensive cyber capabilities across specific attack phases, and conclude with recommendations on prioritizing defenses. In all, we consider this to be the most comprehensive AI cyber risk evaluation framework published so far.

# How Problematic Writer-AI Interactions (Rather than Problematic AI) Hinder Writers' Idea Generation 

**Authors**: Khonzoda Umarova, Talia Wise, Zhuoer Lyu, Mina Lee, Qian Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11915)  

**Abstract**: Writing about a subject enriches writers' understanding of that subject. This cognitive benefit of writing -- known as constructive learning -- is essential to how students learn in various disciplines. However, does this benefit persist when students write with generative AI writing assistants? Prior research suggests the answer varies based on the type of AI, e.g., auto-complete systems tend to hinder ideation, while assistants that pose Socratic questions facilitate it. This paper adds an additional perspective. Through a case study, we demonstrate that the impact of genAI on students' idea development depends not only on the AI but also on the students and, crucially, their interactions in between. Students who proactively explored ideas gained new ideas from writing, regardless of whether they used auto-complete or Socratic AI assistants. Those who engaged in prolonged, mindless copyediting developed few ideas even with a Socratic AI. These findings suggest opportunities in designing AI writing assistants, not merely by creating more thought-provoking AI, but also by fostering more thought-provoking writer-AI interactions.

# RTD-Lite: Scalable Topological Analysis for Comparing Weighted Graphs in Learning Tasks 

**Authors**: Eduard Tulchinskii, Daria Voronkova, Ilya Trofimov, Evgeny Burnaev, Serguei Barannikov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11910)  

**Abstract**: Topological methods for comparing weighted graphs are valuable in various learning tasks but often suffer from computational inefficiency on large datasets. We introduce RTD-Lite, a scalable algorithm that efficiently compares topological features, specifically connectivity or cluster structures at arbitrary scales, of two weighted graphs with one-to-one correspondence between vertices. Using minimal spanning trees in auxiliary graphs, RTD-Lite captures topological discrepancies with $O(n^2)$ time and memory complexity. This efficiency enables its application in tasks like dimensionality reduction and neural network training. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that RTD-Lite effectively identifies topological differences while significantly reducing computation time compared to existing methods. Moreover, integrating RTD-Lite into neural network training as a loss function component enhances the preservation of topological structures in learned representations. Our code is publicly available at this https URL

# Revisiting FastMap: New Applications 

**Authors**: Ang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11908)  

**Abstract**: FastMap was first introduced in the Data Mining community for generating Euclidean embeddings of complex objects. In this dissertation, we first present FastMap to generate Euclidean embeddings of graphs in near-linear time: The pairwise Euclidean distances approximate a desired graph-based distance function on the vertices. We then apply the graph version of FastMap to efficiently solve various graph-theoretic problems of significant interest in AI: including facility location, top-K centrality computations, community detection and block modeling, and graph convex hull computations. We also present a novel learning framework, called FastMapSVM, by combining FastMap and Support Vector Machines. We then apply FastMapSVM to predict the satisfiability of Constraint Satisfaction Problems and to classify seismograms in Earthquake Science.

**Authors**: Ch Muhammad Awais, Marco Reggiannini, Davide Moroni, Emanuele Salerno  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11906)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ship classification. This survey comprehensively analyzes the diverse DL techniques employed in this domain. We identify critical trends and challenges, highlighting the importance of integrating handcrafted features, utilizing public datasets, data augmentation, fine-tuning, explainability techniques, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to improve DL model performance. This survey establishes a first-of-its-kind taxonomy for categorizing relevant research based on DL models, handcrafted feature use, SAR attribute utilization, and the impact of fine-tuning. We discuss the methodologies used in SAR ship classification tasks and the impact of different techniques. Finally, the survey explores potential avenues for future research, including addressing data scarcity, exploring novel DL architectures, incorporating interpretability techniques, and establishing standardized performance metrics. By addressing these challenges and leveraging advancements in DL, researchers can contribute to developing more accurate and efficient ship classification systems, ultimately enhancing maritime surveillance and related applications.

# Upcycling Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Multi-Task Capabilities 

**Authors**: Ruchika Chavhan, Abhinav Mehrotra, Malcolm Chadwick, Alberto Gil Ramos, Luca Morreale, Mehdi Noroozi, Sourav Bhattacharya  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11905)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-image synthesis has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. Many attempts have been made to adopt text-to-image models to support multiple tasks. However, existing approaches typically require resource-intensive re-training or additional parameters to accommodate for the new tasks, which makes the model inefficient for on-device deployment. We propose Multi-Task Upcycling (MTU), a simple yet effective recipe that extends the capabilities of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to support a variety of image-to-image generation tasks. MTU replaces Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in the diffusion model with smaller FFNs, referred to as experts, and combines them with a dynamic routing mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, MTU is the first multi-task diffusion modeling approach that seamlessly blends multi-tasking with on-device compatibility, by mitigating the issue of parameter inflation. We show that the performance of MTU is on par with the single-task fine-tuned diffusion models across several tasks including image editing, super-resolution, and inpainting, while maintaining similar latency and computational load (GFLOPs) as the single-task fine-tuned models.

**Abstract**: In this study, we characterize GPU failures in Delta, the current large-scale AI system with over 600 petaflops of peak compute throughput. The system comprises GPU and non-GPU nodes with modern AI accelerators, such as NVIDIA A40, A100, and H100 GPUs. The study uses two and a half years of data on GPU errors. We evaluate the resilience of GPU hardware components to determine the vulnerability of different GPU components to failure and their impact on the GPU and node availability. We measure the key propagation paths in GPU hardware, GPU interconnect (NVLink), and GPU memory. Finally, we evaluate the impact of the observed GPU errors on user jobs. Our key findings are: (i) Contrary to common beliefs, GPU memory is over 30x more reliable than GPU hardware in terms of MTBE (mean time between errors). (ii) The newly introduced GSP (GPU System Processor) is the most vulnerable GPU hardware component. (iii) NVLink errors did not always lead to user job failure, and we attribute it to the underlying error detection and retry mechanisms employed. (iv) We show multiple examples of hardware errors originating from one of the key GPU hardware components, leading to application failure. (v) We project the impact of GPU node availability on larger scales with emulation and find that significant overprovisioning between 5-20% would be necessary to handle GPU failures. If GPU availability were improved to 99.9%, the overprovisioning would be reduced by 4x.

# LLMs for Translation: Historical, Low-Resourced Languages and Contemporary AI Models 

**Authors**: Merve Tekgurler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11898)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability in performing various tasks, including machine translation (MT), without explicit training. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini are frequently evaluated on translation benchmarks and utilized as translation tools due to their high performance. This paper examines Gemini's performance in translating an 18th-century Ottoman Turkish manuscript, Prisoner of the Infidels: The Memoirs of Osman Agha of Timisoara, into English. The manuscript recounts the experiences of Osman Agha, an Ottoman subject who spent 11 years as a prisoner of war in Austria, and includes his accounts of warfare and violence. Our analysis reveals that Gemini's safety mechanisms flagged between 14 and 23 percent of the manuscript as harmful, resulting in untranslated passages. These safety settings, while effective in mitigating potential harm, hinder the model's ability to provide complete and accurate translations of historical texts. Through real historical examples, this study highlights the inherent challenges and limitations of current LLM safety implementations in the handling of sensitive and context-rich materials. These real-world instances underscore potential failures of LLMs in contemporary translation scenarios, where accurate and comprehensive translations are crucial-for example, translating the accounts of modern victims of war for legal proceedings or humanitarian documentation.

# Expressive Music Data Processing and Generation 

**Authors**: Jingwei Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11896)  

**Abstract**: Musical expressivity and coherence are indispensable in music composition and performance, while often neglected in modern AI generative models. In this work, we introduce a listening-based data-processing technique that captures the expressivity in musical performance. This technique derived from Weber's law reflects the human perceptual truth of listening and preserves musical subtlety and expressivity in the training input. To facilitate musical coherence, we model the output interdependencies among multiple arguments in the music data such as pitch, duration, velocity, etc. in the neural networks based on the probabilistic chain rule. In practice, we decompose the multi-output sequential model into single-output submodels and condition previously sampled outputs on the subsequent submodels to induce conditional distributions. Finally, to select eligible sequences from all generations, a tentative measure based on the output entropy was proposed. The entropy sequence is set as a criterion to select predictable and stable generations, which is further studied under the context of informational aesthetic measures to quantify musical pleasure and information gain along the music tendency.

# Resolving UnderEdit & OverEdit with Iterative & Neighbor-Assisted Model Editing 

**Authors**: Bhiman Kumar Baghel, Scott M. Jordan, Zheyuan Ryan Shi, Xiang Lorraine Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11895)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in various downstream language tasks, making it crucial to keep their knowledge up-to-date, but both retraining and fine-tuning the model can be costly. Model editing offers an efficient and effective alternative by a single update to only a key subset of model parameters. While being efficient, these methods are not perfect. Sometimes knowledge edits are unsuccessful, i.e., UnderEdit, or the edit contaminated neighboring knowledge that should remain unchanged, i.e., OverEdit. To address these limitations, we propose iterative model editing, based on our hypothesis that a single parameter update is often insufficient, to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to minimize OverEdit. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods effectively reduce UnderEdit up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit up to 6 percentage points across multiple model editing algorithms, LLMs, and benchmark datasets.

# FedALT: Federated Fine-Tuning through Adaptive Local Training with Rest-of-the-World LoRA 

**Authors**: Jieming Bian, Lei Wang, Letian Zhang, Jie Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11880)  

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in federated settings enables privacy-preserving adaptation but suffers from cross-client interference due to model aggregation. Existing federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, primarily based on FedAvg, struggle with data heterogeneity, leading to harmful cross-client interference and suboptimal personalization. In this work, we propose \textbf{FedALT}, a novel personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning algorithm that fundamentally departs from FedAvg. Instead of using an aggregated model to initialize local training, each client continues training its individual LoRA while incorporating shared knowledge through a separate Rest-of-the-World (RoTW) LoRA component. To effectively balance local adaptation and global information, FedALT introduces an adaptive mixer that dynamically learns input-specific weightings between the individual and RoTW LoRA components using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) principle. Through extensive experiments on NLP benchmarks, we demonstrate that FedALT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art personalized federated LoRA fine-tuning methods, achieving superior local adaptation without sacrificing computational efficiency.

# DCAT: Dual Cross-Attention Fusion for Disease Classification in Radiological Images with Uncertainty Estimation 

**Authors**: Jutika Borah, Hidam Kumarjit Singh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11851)  

**Abstract**: Accurate and reliable image classification is crucial in radiology, where diagnostic decisions significantly impact patient outcomes. Conventional deep learning models tend to produce overconfident predictions despite underlying uncertainties, potentially leading to misdiagnoses. Attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, enabling models to focus on relevant parts of the input data. Combined with feature fusion, they can be effective in addressing uncertainty challenges. Cross-attention has become increasingly important in medical image analysis for capturing dependencies across features and modalities. This paper proposes a novel dual cross-attention fusion model for medical image analysis by addressing key challenges in feature integration and interpretability. Our approach introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism with refined channel and spatial attention that dynamically fuses feature maps from EfficientNetB4 and ResNet34 leveraging multi-network contextual dependencies. The refined features through channel and spatial attention highlights discriminative patterns crucial for accurate classification. The proposed model achieved AUC of 99.75%, 100%, 99.93% and 98.69% and AUPR of 99.81%, 100%, 99.97%, and 96.36% on Covid-19, Tuberculosis, Pneumonia Chest X-ray images and Retinal OCT images respectively. The entropy values and several high uncertain samples give an interpretable visualization from the model enhancing transparency. By combining multi-scale feature extraction, bidirectional attention and uncertainty estimation, our proposed model strongly impacts medical image analysis.

# From Pixels to Histopathology: A Graph-Based Framework for Interpretable Whole Slide Image Analysis 

**Authors**: Alexander Weers, Alexander H. Berger, Laurin Lux, Peter Schüffler, Daniel Rueckert, Johannes C. Paetzold  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11846)  

**Abstract**: The histopathological classification of whole-slide images (WSIs) is a fundamental task in digital pathology; yet it requires extensive time and expertise from specialists. While deep learning methods show promising results, they typically process WSIs by dividing them into artificial patches, which inherently prevents a network from learning from the entire image context, disregards natural tissue structures and compromises interpretability. Our method overcomes this limitation through a novel graph-based framework that constructs WSI graph representations. The WSI-graph efficiently captures essential histopathological information in a compact form. We build tissue representations (nodes) that follow biological boundaries rather than arbitrary patches all while providing interpretable features for explainability. Through adaptive graph coarsening guided by learned embeddings, we progressively merge regions while maintaining discriminative local features and enabling efficient global information exchange. In our method's final step, we solve the diagnostic task through a graph attention network. We empirically demonstrate strong performance on multiple challenging tasks such as cancer stage classification and survival prediction, while also identifying predictive factors using Integrated Gradients. Our implementation is publicly available at this https URL

**Authors**: Oscar Morris  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11836)  

**Abstract**: Feedback is a very important part the learning process. However, it is challenging to make this feedback both timely and accurate when relying on human markers. This is the challenge that Automated Feedback Generation attempts to address. In this paper, a technique to train such a system on a very small dataset with very long sequences is presented. Both of these attributes make this a very challenging task, however, by using a three stage transfer learning pipeline state-of-the-art results can be achieved with qualitatively accurate but unhuman sounding results. The use of both Automated Essay Scoring and Automated Feedback Generation systems in the real world is also discussed.

# Semi-Supervised Co-Training of Time and Time-Frequency Models: Application to Bearing Fault Diagnosis 

**Authors**: Tuomas Jalonen, Mohammad Al-Sa'd, Serkan Kiranyaz, Moncef Gabbouj  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11824)  

**Abstract**: Neural networks require massive amounts of annotated data to train intelligent solutions. Acquiring many labeled data in industrial applications is often difficult; therefore, semi-supervised approaches are preferred. We propose a new semi-supervised co-training method, which combines time and time-frequency (TF) machine learning models to improve performance and reliability. The developed framework collaboratively co-trains fast time-domain models by utilizing high-performing TF techniques without increasing the inference complexity. Besides, it operates in cloud-edge networks and offers holistic support for many applications covering edge-real-time monitoring and cloud-based updates and corrections. Experimental results on bearing fault diagnosis verify the superiority of our technique compared to a competing self-training method. The results from two case studies show that our method outperforms self-training for different noise levels and amounts of available data with accuracy gains reaching from 10.6% to 33.9%. They demonstrate that fusing time-domain and TF-based models offers opportunities for developing high-performance industrial solutions.

# Mitigating Bad Ground Truth in Supervised Machine Learning based Crop Classification: A Multi-Level Framework with Sentinel-2 Images 

**Authors**: Sanayya A, Amoolya Shetty, Abhijeet Sharma, Venkatesh Ravichandran, Masthan Wali Gosuvarapalli, Sarthak Jain, Priyamvada Nanjundiah, Ujjal Kr Dutta, Divya Sharma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11807)  

**Abstract**: In agricultural management, precise Ground Truth (GT) data is crucial for accurate Machine Learning (ML) based crop classification. Yet, issues like crop mislabeling and incorrect land identification are common. We propose a multi-level GT cleaning framework while utilizing multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data to address these issues. Specifically, this framework utilizes generating embeddings for farmland, clustering similar crop profiles, and identification of outliers indicating GT errors. We validated clusters with False Colour Composite (FCC) checks and used distance-based metrics to scale and automate this verification process. The importance of cleaning the GT data became apparent when the models were trained on the clean and unclean data. For instance, when we trained a Random Forest model with the clean GT data, we achieved upto 70\% absolute percentage points higher for the F1 score metric. This approach advances crop classification methodologies, with potential for applications towards improving loan underwriting and agricultural decision-making.

# Semantic-Clipping: Efficient Vision-Language Modeling with Semantic-Guidedd Visual Selection 

**Authors**: Bangzheng Li, Fei Wang, Wenxuan Zhou, Nan Xu, Ben Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Hoifung Poon, Muhao Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11794)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage aligned visual encoders to transform images into visual tokens, allowing them to be processed similarly to text by the backbone large language model (LLM). This unified input paradigm enables VLMs to excel in vision-language tasks such as visual question answering (VQA). To improve fine-grained visual reasoning, recent advancements in vision-language modeling introduce image cropping techniques that feed all encoded sub-images into the model. However, this approach significantly increases the number of visual tokens, leading to inefficiency and potential distractions for the LLM. To address the generalization challenges of image representation in VLMs, we propose a lightweight, universal framework that seamlessly integrates with existing VLMs to enhance their ability to process finegrained details. Our method leverages textual semantics to identify key visual areas, improving VQA performance without requiring any retraining of the VLM. Additionally, it incorporates textual signals into the visual encoding process, enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. The proposed method, SEMCLIP, strengthens the visual understanding of a 7B VLM, LLaVA-1.5 by 3.3% on average across 7 benchmarks, and particularly by 5.3% on the challenging detailed understanding benchmark V*.

# Safe Vision-Language Models via Unsafe Weights Manipulation 

**Authors**: Moreno D'Incà, Elia Peruzzo, Xingqian Xu, Humphrey Shi, Nicu Sebe, Massimiliano Mancini  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11742)  

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) often inherit the biases and unsafe associations present within their large-scale training dataset. While recent approaches mitigate unsafe behaviors, their evaluation focuses on how safe the model is on unsafe inputs, ignoring potential shortcomings on safe ones. In this paper, we first revise safety evaluation by introducing SafeGround, a new set of metrics that evaluate safety at different levels of granularity. With this metric, we uncover a surprising issue of training-based methods: they make the model less safe on safe inputs. From this finding, we take a different direction and explore whether it is possible to make a model safer without training, introducing Unsafe Weights Manipulation (UWM). UWM uses a calibration set of safe and unsafe instances to compare activations between safe and unsafe content, identifying the most important parameters for processing the latter. Their values are then manipulated via negation. Experiments show that UWM achieves the best tradeoff between safety and knowledge preservation, consistently improving VLMs on unsafe queries while outperforming even training-based state-of-the-art methods on safe ones.

# BioMamba: Leveraging Spectro-Temporal Embedding in Bidirectional Mamba for Enhanced Biosignal Classification 

**Authors**: Jian Qian, Teck Lun Goh, Bingyu Xie, Chengyao Zhu, Biao Wan, Yawen Guan, Patrick Yin Chiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11741)  

**Abstract**: Biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), play a pivotal role in numerous clinical practices, such as diagnosing brain and cardiac arrhythmic diseases. Existing methods for biosignal classification rely on Attention-based frameworks with dense Feed Forward layers, which lead to inefficient learning, high computational overhead, and suboptimal performance. In this work, we introduce BioMamba, a Spectro-Temporal Embedding strategy applied to the Bidirectional Mamba framework with Sparse Feed Forward layers to enable effective learning of biosignal sequences. By integrating these three key components, BioMamba effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with marked improvement in classification performance. The advantages of the proposed BioMamba include (1) Reliability: BioMamba consistently delivers robust results, confirmed across six evaluation metrics. (2) Efficiency: We assess both model and training efficiency, the BioMamba demonstrates computational effectiveness by reducing model size and resource consumption compared to existing approaches. (3) Generality: With the capacity to effectively classify a diverse set of tasks, BioMamba demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness across various domains and applications.

# CoLLMLight: Cooperative Large Language Model Agents for Network-Wide Traffic Signal Control 

**Authors**: Zirui Yuan, Siqi Lai, Hao Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11739)  

**Abstract**: Traffic Signal Control (TSC) plays a critical role in urban traffic management by optimizing traffic flow and mitigating congestion. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for TSC due to their exceptional problem-solving and generalization capabilities, existing approaches fail to address the essential need for inter-agent coordination, limiting their effectiveness in achieving network-wide optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose CoLLMLight, a cooperative LLM agent framework for TSC. Specifically, we first construct a structured spatiotemporal graph to capture real-time traffic dynamics and spatial relationships among neighboring intersections, enabling the LLM to reason about complex traffic interactions. Moreover, we introduce a complexity-aware reasoning mechanism that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on real-time traffic conditions, ensuring optimal computational efficiency without sacrificing decision quality. Besides, we propose a fine-tuning strategy that leverages iterative simulation-driven data collection and environmental feedback to build a lightweight LLM tailored for cooperative TSC. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoLLMLight outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diverse traffic scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness, scalability, and robustness.

# Multi-View Node Pruning for Accurate Graph Representation 

**Authors**: Jiseong Park, Hanjin Kim, Seojin Kim, Jueun Choi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11737)  

**Abstract**: Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.

# LLM Agents for Education: Advances and Applications 

**Authors**: Zhendong Chu, Shen Wang, Jian Xie, Tinghui Zhu, Yibo Yan, Jinheng Ye, Aoxiao Zhong, Xuming Hu, Jing Liang, Philip S. Yu, Qingsong Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11733)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automating tasks and driving innovation across diverse educational applications. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of state-of-the-art research on LLM agents in education, categorizing them into two broad classes: (1) \emph{Pedagogical Agents}, which focus on automating complex pedagogical tasks to support both teachers and students; and (2) \emph{Domain-Specific Educational Agents}, which are tailored for specialized fields such as science education, language learning, and professional development. We comprehensively examine the technological advancements underlying these LLM agents, including key datasets, benchmarks, and algorithmic frameworks that drive their effectiveness. Furthermore, we discuss critical challenges such as privacy, bias and fairness concerns, hallucination mitigation, and integration with existing educational ecosystems. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive technological overview of LLM agents for education, fostering further research and collaboration to enhance their impact for the greater good of learners and educators alike.

# Class-Level Feature Selection Method Using Feature Weighted Growing Self-Organising Maps 

**Authors**: Andrew Starkey, Uduak Idio Akpan, Omaimah AL Hosni, Yaseen Pullissery  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11732)  

**Abstract**: There have been several attempts to develop Feature Selection (FS) algorithms capable of identifying features that are relevant in a dataset. Although in certain applications the FS algorithms can be seen to be successful, they have similar basic limitations. In all cases, the global feature selection algorithms seek to select features that are relevant and common to all classes of the dataset. This is a major limitation since there could be features that are specifically useful for a particular class while irrelevant for other classes, and full explanation of the relationship at class level therefore cannot be determined. While the inclusion of such features for all classes could cause improved predictive ability for the relevant class, the same features could be problematic for other classes. In this paper, we examine this issue and also develop a class-level feature selection method called the Feature Weighted Growing Self-Organising Map (FWGSOM). The proposed method carries out feature analysis at class level which enhances its ability to identify relevant features for each class. Results from experiments indicate that our method performs better than other methods, gives explainable results at class level, and has a low computational footprint when compared to other methods.

# BACE-RUL: A Bi-directional Adversarial Network with Covariate Encoding for Machine Remaining Useful Life Prediction 

**Authors**: Zekai Zhang, Dan Li, Shunyu Wu, Junya Cai, Bo Zhang, See Kiong Ng, Zibin Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11730)  

**Abstract**: Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) are crucial ways to avoid unnecessary maintenance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and improve system reliability. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is one of the most challenging tasks for PHM. Existing methods require prior knowledge about the system, contrived assumptions, or temporal mining to model the life cycles of machine equipment/devices, resulting in diminished accuracy and limited applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a Bi-directional Adversarial network with Covariate Encoding for machine Remaining Useful Life (BACE-RUL) prediction, which only adopts sensor measurements from the current life cycle to predict RUL rather than relying on previous consecutive cycle recordings. The current sensor measurements of mechanical devices are encoded to a conditional space to better understand the implicit inner mechanical status. The predictor is trained as a conditional generative network with the encoded sensor measurements as its conditions. Various experiments on several real-world datasets, including the turbofan aircraft engine dataset and the dataset collected from degradation experiments of Li-Ion battery cells, show that the proposed model is a general framework and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

# Forecasting Empty Container availability for Vehicle Booking System Application 

**Authors**: Arthur Cartel Foahom Gouabou, Mohammed Al-Kharaz, Faouzi Hakimi, Tarek Khaled, Kenza Amzil  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11728)  

**Abstract**: Container terminals, pivotal nodes in the network of empty container movement, hold significant potential for enhancing operational efficiency within terminal depots through effective collaboration between transporters and terminal operators. This collaboration is crucial for achieving optimization, leading to streamlined operations and reduced congestion, thereby benefiting both parties. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop the most suitable forecasting approaches to address this challenge. This study focuses on developing and evaluating a data-driven approach for forecasting empty container availability at container terminal depots within a Vehicle Booking System (VBS) framework. It addresses the gap in research concerning optimizing empty container dwell time and aims to enhance operational efficiencies in container terminal operations. Four forecasting models-Naive, ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM-are comprehensively analyzed for their predictive capabilities, with LSTM emerging as the top performer due to its ability to capture complex time series patterns. The research underscores the significance of selecting appropriate forecasting techniques tailored to the specific requirements of container terminal operations, contributing to improved operational planning and management in maritime logistics.

# SPECTra: Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Permutation-Free Networks 

**Authors**: Hyunwoo Park, Baekryun Seong, Sang-Ki Ko  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11726)  

**Abstract**: In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the permutation problem where the state space grows exponentially with the number of agents reduces sample efficiency. Additionally, many existing architectures struggle with scalability, relying on a fixed structure tied to a specific number of agents, limiting their applicability to environments with a variable number of entities. While approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-attention mechanisms have progressed in addressing these challenges, they have significant limitations as dense GNNs and self-attention mechanisms incur high computational costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agent network and a non-linear mixing network that ensure permutation-equivariance and scalability, allowing them to generalize to environments with various numbers of agents. Our agent network significantly reduces computational complexity, and our scalable hypernetwork enables efficient weight generation for non-linear mixing. Additionally, we introduce curriculum learning to improve training efficiency. Experiments on SMACv2 and Google Research Football (GRF) demonstrate that our approach achieves superior learning performance compared to existing methods. By addressing both permutation-invariance and scalability in MARL, our work provides a more efficient and adaptable framework for cooperative MARL. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization 

**Authors**: Hanyang Zhao, Haoxian Chen, Yucheng Guo, Genta Indra Winata, Tingting Ou, Ziyu Huang, David D. Yao, Wenpin Tang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11720)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images to extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models.

# Privacy-Preserved Automated Scoring using Federated Learning for Educational Research 

**Authors**: Ehsan Latif, Xiaoming Zhai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11711)  

**Abstract**: Data privacy remains a critical concern in educational research, necessitating Institutional Review Board (IRB) certification and stringent data handling protocols to ensure compliance with ethical standards. Traditional approaches rely on anonymization and controlled data-sharing mechanisms to facilitate research while mitigating privacy risks. However, these methods still involve direct access to raw student data, posing potential vulnerabilities and being time-consuming. This study proposes a federated learning (FL) framework for automatic scoring in educational assessments, eliminating the need to share raw data. Our approach leverages client-side model training, where student responses are processed locally on edge devices, and only optimized model parameters are shared with a central aggregation server. To effectively aggregate heterogeneous model updates, we introduce an adaptive weighted averaging strategy, which dynamically adjusts weight contributions based on client-specific learning characteristics. This method ensures robust model convergence while preserving privacy. We evaluate our framework using assessment data from nine middle schools, comparing the accuracy of federated learning-based scoring models with traditionally trained centralized models. A statistical significance test (paired t-test, $t(8) = 2.29, p = 0.051$) confirms that the accuracy difference between the two approaches is not statistically significant, demonstrating that federated learning achieves comparable performance while safeguarding student data. Furthermore, our method significantly reduces data collection, processing, and deployment overhead, accelerating the adoption of AI-driven educational assessments in a privacy-compliant manner.

# ConjointNet: Enhancing Conjoint Analysis for Preference Prediction with Representation Learning 

**Authors**: Yanxia Zhang, Francine Chen, Shabnam Hakimi, Totte Harinen, Alex Filipowicz, Yan-Ying Chen, Rumen Iliev, Nikos Arechiga, Kalani Murakami, Kent Lyons, Charlene Wu, Matt Klenk  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11710)  

**Abstract**: Understanding consumer preferences is essential to product design and predicting market response to these new products. Choice-based conjoint analysis is widely used to model user preferences using their choices in surveys. However, traditional conjoint estimation techniques assume simple linear models. This assumption may lead to limited predictability and inaccurate estimation of product attribute contributions, especially on data that has underlying non-linear relationships. In this work, we employ representation learning to efficiently alleviate this issue. We propose ConjointNet, which is composed of two novel neural architectures, to predict user preferences. We demonstrate that the proposed ConjointNet models outperform traditional conjoint estimate techniques on two preference datasets by over 5%, and offer insights into non-linear feature interactions.

# Conformal Prediction and Human Decision Making 

**Authors**: Jessica Hullman, Yifan Wu, Dawei Xie, Ziyang Guo, Andrew Gelman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11709)  

**Abstract**: Methods to quantify uncertainty in predictions from arbitrary models are in demand in high-stakes domains like medicine and finance. Conformal prediction has emerged as a popular method for producing a set of predictions with specified average coverage, in place of a single prediction and confidence value. However, the value of conformal prediction sets to assist human decisions remains elusive due to the murky relationship between coverage guarantees and decision makers' goals and strategies. How should we think about conformal prediction sets as a form of decision support? Under what conditions do we expect the support they provide to be superior versus inferior to that of alternative presentations of predictive uncertainty? We outline a decision theoretic framework for evaluating predictive uncertainty as informative signals, then contrast what can be said within this framework about idealized use of calibrated probabilities versus conformal prediction sets. Informed by prior empirical results and theories of human decisions under uncertainty, we formalize a set of possible strategies by which a decision maker might use a prediction set. We identify ways in which conformal prediction sets and posthoc predictive uncertainty quantification more broadly are in tension with common goals and needs in human-AI decision making. We give recommendations for future research in predictive uncertainty quantification to support human decision makers.

# Refining Filter Global Feature Weighting for Fully-Unsupervised Clustering 

**Authors**: Fabian Galis, Darian Onchis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11706)  

**Abstract**: In the context of unsupervised learning, effective clustering plays a vital role in revealing patterns and insights from unlabeled data. However, the success of clustering algorithms often depends on the relevance and contribution of features, which can differ between various datasets. This paper explores feature weighting for clustering and presents new weighting strategies, including methods based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a technique commonly used for providing explainability in various supervised machine learning tasks. By taking advantage of SHAP values in a way other than just to gain explainability, we use them to weight features and ultimately improve the clustering process itself in unsupervised scenarios.
Our empirical evaluations across five benchmark datasets and clustering methods demonstrate that feature weighting based on SHAP can enhance unsupervised clustering quality, achieving up to a 22.69\% improvement over other weighting methods (from 0.586 to 0.719 in terms of the Adjusted Rand Index). Additionally, these situations where the weighted data boosts the results are highlighted and thoroughly explored, offering insight for practical applications.

**Abstract**: Managing equal charge levels in active cell balancing while charging a Li-ion battery is challenging. An imbalance in charge levels affects the state of health of the battery, along with the concerns of thermal runaway and fire hazards. Traditional methods focus on safety assurance as a trade-off between safety and charging time. Others deal with battery-specific conditions to ensure safety, therefore losing on the generalization of the control strategies over various configurations of batteries. In this work, we propose a method to learn safe battery charging actions by using a safety-layer as an add-on over a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. The safety layer perturbs the agent's action to prevent the battery from encountering unsafe or dangerous states. Further, our Deep RL framework focuses on learning a generalized policy that can be effectively employed with varying configurations of batteries. Our experimental results demonstrate that the safety-layer based action perturbation incurs fewer safety violations by avoiding unsafe states along with learning a robust policy for several battery configurations.

**Abstract**: Patient mobility monitoring in intensive care is critical for ensuring timely interventions and improving clinical outcomes. While accelerometry-based sensor data are widely adopted in training artificial intelligence models to estimate patient mobility, existing approaches face two key limitations highlighted in clinical practice: (1) modeling the long-term accelerometer data is challenging due to the high dimensionality, variability, and noise, and (2) the absence of efficient and robust methods for long-term mobility assessment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MELON, a novel multimodal framework designed to predict 12-hour mobility status in the critical care setting. MELON leverages the power of a dual-branch network architecture, combining the strengths of spectrogram-based visual representations and sequential accelerometer statistical features. MELON effectively captures global and fine-grained mobility patterns by integrating a pre-trained image encoder for rich frequency-domain feature extraction and a Mixture-of-Experts encoder for sequence modeling. We trained and evaluated the MELON model on the multimodal dataset of 126 patients recruited from nine Intensive Care Units at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital main campus in Gainesville, Florida. Experiments showed that MELON outperforms conventional approaches for 12-hour mobility status estimation with an overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 (95\%, confidence interval 0.78-0.86). Notably, our experiments also revealed that accelerometer data collected from the wrist provides robust predictive performance compared with data from the ankle, suggesting a single-sensor solution that can reduce patient burden and lower deployment costs...

# Timing-Driven Global Placement by Efficient Critical Path Extraction 

**Authors**: Yunqi Shi, Siyuan Xu, Shixiong Kai, Xi Lin, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian

**Abstract**: Timing optimization during the global placement of integrated circuits has been a significant focus for decades, yet it remains a complex, unresolved issue. Recent analytical methods typically use pin-level timing information to adjust net weights, which is fast and simple but neglects the path-based nature of the timing graph. The existing path-based methods, however, cannot balance the accuracy and efficiency due to the exponential growth of number of critical paths. In this work, we propose a GPU-accelerated timing-driven global placement framework, integrating accurate path-level information into the efficient DREAMPlace infrastructure. It optimizes the fine-grained pin-to-pin attraction objective and is facilitated by efficient critical path extraction. We also design a quadratic distance loss function specifically to align with the RC timing model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the current leading timing-driven placers, achieving an average improvement of 40.5% in total negative slack (TNS) and 8.3% in worst negative slack (WNS), as well as an improvement in half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL).

# Optimizing Coverage-Driven Verification Using Machine Learning and PyUVM: A Novel Approach 

**Authors**: Suruchi Kumari, Deepak Narayan Gadde, Aman Kumar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11666)  

**Abstract**: The escalating complexity of System-on-Chip (SoC) designs has created a bottleneck in verification, with traditional techniques struggling to achieve complete coverage. Existing techniques, such as Constrained Random Verification (CRV) and coverage-driven methodologies, rely on time-consuming and redundant simulation regression, leading to higher verification costs and longer time-to-market due to the manual effort required to adjust constraints and drive the stimuli to achieve coverage objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology that leverages supervised Machine Learning (ML) to optimize simulation regressions, resulting in reduced simulation run-time and the number of test simulations required to achieve target coverage goals. We also investigate and compare the effectiveness of various supervised learning algorithms from scikit-learn. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms can achieve at least 99% coverage regain with significantly reduced simulation cycles. We utilize Python Universal Verification Methodology (PyUVM) over SystemVerilog-Universal Verification Methodology (SV-UVM) for testbench creation, enabling simpler constructs using Python and facilitating the reuse of existing ML libraries. Our methodology is applied to three diverse designs, and our results show that it can significantly reduce verification costs, manual efforts, and time-to-market, while enhancing verification productivity and completeness, by automating the testbench update process and achieving target coverage goals.

# MEADOW: Memory-efficient Dataflow and Data Packing for Low Power Edge LLMs 

**Authors**: Abhishek Moitra, Arkapravo Ghosh, Shrey Agarwal, Aporva Amarnath, Karthik Swaminathan, Priyadarshini Panda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11663)  

**Abstract**: The computational and memory challenges of large language models (LLMs) have sparked several optimization approaches towards their efficient implementation. While prior LLM-targeted quantization, and prior works on sparse acceleration have significantly mitigated the memory and computation bottleneck, they do so assuming high power platforms such as GPUs and server-class FPGAs with large off-chip memory bandwidths and employ a generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) execution of all the layers in the decoder. In such a GEMM-based execution, data is fetched from an off-chip memory, computed and stored back. However, at reduced off-chip memory capacities, as is the case with low-power edge devices, this implementation strategy significantly increases the attention computation latency owing to the repeated storage and fetch of large intermediate tokens to and from the off-chip memory. Moreover, fetching the weight matrices from a bandwidth constrained memory further aggravates the memory bottleneck problem. To this end, we introduce MEADOW, a framework that significantly reduces the off-chip memory access for LLMs with a novel token-parallel head-sequential (TPHS) dataflow. Additionally, MEADOW applies weight packing that performs loss-less decomposition of large weight matrices to their unique elements thereby, reducing the enormous weight fetch latency. MEADOW demonstrates 1.5x and 2.5x lower decode and prefill latency, respectively, compared to a GEMM-based LLM implementation on the low power Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA platform that consumes less than 10W. Additionally, MEADOW achieves an end-to-end latency improvement of over 40%, compared to prior LLM optimization works.

# Lorecast: Layout-Aware Performance and Power Forecasting from Natural Language 

**Authors**: Runzhi Wang, Prianka Sengupta, Yiran Chen, Jiang Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11662)  

**Abstract**: In chip design planning, obtaining reliable performance and power forecasts for various design options is of critical importance. Traditionally, this involves using system-level models, which often lack accuracy, or trial synthesis, which is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. We introduce a new methodology, called Lorecast, which accepts English prompts as input to rapidly generate layout-aware performance and power estimates. This approach bypasses the need for HDL code development or synthesis, making it both fast and user-friendly. Experimental results demonstrate that Lorecast achieves accuracy within a few percent of error compared to post-layout analysis.

# Circuit Diagram Retrieval Based on Hierarchical Circuit Graph Representation 

**Authors**: Ming Gao, Ruichen Qiu, Zeng Hui Chang, Kanjian Zhang, Haikun Wei, Hong Cai Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11658)  

**Abstract**: In the domain of analog circuit design, the retrieval of circuit diagrams has drawn a great interest, primarily due to its vital role in the consultation of legacy designs and the detection of design plagiarism. Existing image retrieval techniques are adept at handling natural images, which converts images into feature vectors and retrieval similar images according to the closeness of these vectors. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit limitations when applied to the more specialized and intricate domain of circuit diagrams. This paper presents a novel approach to circuit diagram retrieval by employing a graph representation of circuit diagrams, effectively reformulating the retrieval task as a graph retrieval problem. The proposed methodology consists of two principal components: a circuit diagram recognition algorithm designed to extract the circuit components and topological structure of the circuit using proposed GAM-YOLO model and a 2-step connected domain filtering algorithm, and a hierarchical retrieval strategy based on graph similarity and different graph representation methods for analog circuits. Our methodology pioneers the utilization of graph representation in the retrieval of circuit diagrams, incorporating topological features that are commonly overlooked by standard image retrieval methods. The results of our experiments substantiate the efficacy of our approach in retrieving circuit diagrams across of different types.

**Authors**: Donghao Huang, Zhaoxia Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.11655)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities. However, the trade-offs between model performance, efficiency, and explainability of some latest models remain underexplored. This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of the DeepSeek-R1 series of models, reasoning open-source LLMs, for sentiment analysis, comparing them against OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4-mini. We systematically analyze their performance under few-shot prompting conditions, scaling up to 50-shot configurations to assess in-context learning effectiveness. Our experiments reveal that DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates competitive accuracy, particularly in multi-class sentiment tasks, while offering enhanced interpretability through its detailed reasoning process. Additionally, we highlight the impact of increasing few-shot examples on model performance and discuss key trade-offs between explainability and computational efficiency.
