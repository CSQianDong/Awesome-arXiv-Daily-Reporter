MMU aims to explore and comprehend the meanings of memes from various perspectives by performing tasks such as metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, intention detection, and offensiveness detection. Despite making progress, limitations persist due to the loss of fine-grained metaphorical visual clue and the neglect of multimodal text-image weak correlation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-granular multimodal clue fusion model (MGMCF) to advance MMU. Firstly, we design an object-level semantic mining module to extract object-level image feature clues, achieving fine-grained feature clue extraction and enhancing the model's ability to capture metaphorical details and semantics. Secondly, we propose a brand-new global-local cross-modal interaction model to address the weak correlation between text and images. This model facilitates effective interaction between global multimodal contextual clues and local unimodal feature clues, strengthening their representations through a bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism. Finally, we devise a dual-semantic guided training strategy to enhance the model's understanding and alignment of multimodal representations in the semantic space. Experiments conducted on the widely-used MET-MEME bilingual dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, there is an 8.14% increase in precision for offensiveness detection task, and respective accuracy enhancements of 3.53%, 3.89%, and 3.52% for metaphor recognition, sentiment analysis, and intention detection tasks. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing MMU."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based `RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53\\%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors.

Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos.

Current efforts have relied on unlearning techniques that try to erase the model's knowledge of unsafe concepts. While effective in reducing unwanted outputs, unlearning limits the model's capacity to discern between safe and unsafe content. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that shifts from unlearning to an awareness paradigm by leveraging the inherent hierarchical properties of the hyperbolic space. We propose to encode safe and unsafe content as an entailment hierarchy, where both are placed in different regions of hyperbolic space. Our HySAC, Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP, employs entailment loss functions to model the hierarchical and asymmetrical relations between safe and unsafe image-text pairs. This modelling, ineffective in standard vision-language models due to their reliance on Euclidean embeddings, endows the model with awareness of unsafe content, enabling it to serve as both a multimodal unsafe classifier and a flexible content retriever, with the option to dynamically redirect unsafe queries toward safer alternatives or retain the original output.

However, their susceptibility to generating harmful content when exposed to unsafe queries raises critical safety concerns. While current alignment strategies primarily rely on supervised safety fine-tuning with curated datasets, we identify a fundamental limitation we call the "safety mirage" where supervised fine-tuning inadvertently reinforces spurious correlations between superficial textual patterns and safety responses, rather than fostering deep, intrinsic mitigation of harm. We show that these spurious correlations leave fine-tuned VLMs vulnerable even to a simple one-word modification-based attack, where substituting a single word in text queries with a spurious correlation-inducing alternative can effectively bypass safeguards. Additionally, these correlations contribute to the over prudence, causing fine-tuned VLMs to refuse benign queries unnecessarily. To address this issue, we show machine unlearning (MU) as a powerful alternative to supervised safety fine-tuning as it avoids biased feature-label mappings and directly removes harmful knowledge from VLMs while preserving their general capabilities. Extensive evaluations across safety benchmarks show that under one-word attacks, MU-based alignment reduces the attack success rate by up to 60.17% and cuts unnecessary rejections by over 84.20%.

Furthermore, we developed a cross-modal similarity verification mechanism to quantify semantic consistency, effectively filtering out noise introduced during feature alignment. Even without manually annotated image captions, the refined descriptions alone suffice to construct the MMKG. Compared to conventional MMKGs construction paradigms, our approach achieves substantial storage efficiency gains while maintaining direct entity-to-image linkage capability. Experimental results on multimodal reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMs augmented with VaLiK outperform previous state-of-the-art models. Our code is published at this https URL.'}

Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\\textbf{A}$daptive $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\\textbf{DR}$) and $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\\textbf{DS}$). In the DR stage, we adaptively rebalance the redundant data based on entity distributions, while in the DS stage, we leverage Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and scarce images to supplement underrepresented portions. Through comprehensive evaluations across eleven benchmarks, our proposed ADR effectively mitigates the long-tail problem in the training data, improving the average performance of LLaVA 1.5 relatively by 4.36%, without increasing the training data volume.'}

The key idea is to use text embeddings from a vision-language model to enrich the semantic representation of sketches. Specifically, these text-derived priors specify the part components of the object, compensating for missing visual cues from ambiguous sketches. In addition, we introduce ISG-Net which employs two types of graph convolutional networks: IndivGCN, which processes fine-grained details, and PartGCN, which aggregates these details into parts and refines the structure of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PASTA outperforms existing methods in part-level editing and achieves state-of-the-art results in sketch-to-3D shape generation.'}

To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs.

Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes.

Hamann', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12843', 'abstract': "Geospatial raster (imagery) data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer (LESS ViT) with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both spatial and spectral continuity and physical characteristics of each patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct a benchmark, GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models, achieving superior performance with less computation and fewer parameters. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels."}

The model uniquely integrates visual, audio, and textual modalities via a bi-directional cross-modal attention mechanism with six distinct attention pathways, enabling comprehensive interactions between all modality pairs. Our proposed approach employs modality-specific encoders to extract rich feature representations from synchronized video frames, audio segments, and transcripts. The architecture's novelty lies in its cross-modal enhancement strategy, where each modality representation is refined through weighted attention from other modalities, followed by self-attention refinement through modality-specific encoders. Rather than directly predicting valence-arousal values, MAVEN predicts emotions in a polar coordinate form, aligning with psychological models of the emotion circumplex. Experimental evaluation on the Aff-Wild2 dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, with performance measured using Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC). The multi-stage architecture demonstrates superior ability to capture the complex, nuanced nature of emotional expressions in conversational videos, advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in continuous emotion recognition in-the-wild.

While this approach reduces computational overhead and model complexity, it often requires large amounts of training data to effectively capture the visual knowledge typically encoded by vision models like CLIP. The absence of a vision encoder implies that the model is likely to rely on substantial data to learn the necessary visual-semantic alignments. In this work, we present BREEN, a data-efficient encoder-free multimodal architecture that mitigates this issue. BREEN leverages a learnable query and image experts to achieve comparable performance with significantly less training data. The learnable query, positioned between image and text tokens, is supervised by the output of a pretrained CLIP model to distill visual knowledge, bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities. Additionally, the image expert processes image tokens and learnable queries independently, improving efficiency and reducing interference with the LLM's textual capabilities. BREEN achieves comparable performance to prior encoder-free state-of-the-art models like Mono-InternVL, using only 13 million text-image pairs in training about one percent of the data required by existing methods. Our work highlights a promising direction for data-efficient encoder-free multimodal learning, offering an alternative to traditional encoder-based approaches."}

Extracting data from plots in research papers, however, has been such a complex task that it has predominantly been confined to manual data extraction. We show that current multimodal large language models, with proper instructions and engineered workflows, are capable of accurately extracting data from plots. This capability is inherent to the pretrained models and can be achieved with a chain-of-thought sequence of zero-shot engineered prompts we call PlotExtract, without the need to fine-tune. We demonstrate PlotExtract here and assess its performance on synthetic and published plots. We consider only plots with two axes in this analysis. For plots identified as extractable, PlotExtract finds points with over 90% precision (and around 90% recall) and errors in x and y position of around 5% or lower. These results prove that multimodal LLMs are a viable path for high-throughput data extraction for plots and in many circumstances can replace the current manual methods of data extraction.'}

In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021).

Existing approaches to address this are founded on the implicit premise that visual aesthetics is universal, which is limiting. Aesthetics in the T2I context should be about personalization and we propose the novel task of aesthetics alignment which seeks to align user-specified aesthetics with the T2I generation output. Inspired by how artworks provide an invaluable perspective to approach aesthetics, we codify visual aesthetics using the compositional framework artists employ, known as the Principles of Art (PoA). To facilitate this study, we introduce CompArt, a large-scale compositional art dataset building on top of WikiArt with PoA analysis annotated by a capable Multimodal LLM. Leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and training a lightweight and transferrable adapter, we demonstrate that T2I DMs can effectively offer 10 compositional controls through user-specified PoA conditions.

Specifically, our V-Stylist is a systematical workflow with three key roles: (1) Video Parser decomposes the input video into a number of shots and generates their text prompts of key shot content. Via a concise video-to-shot prompting paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to effectively handle videos with complex transitions. (2) Style Parser identifies the style in the user query and progressively search the matched style model from a style tree. Via a robust tree-of-thought searching paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to precisely specify vague style preference in the open user query. (3) Style Artist leverages the matched model to render all the video shots into the required style. Via a novel multi-round self-reflection paradigm, it allows our V-Stylist to adaptively adjust detail control, according to the style requirement.
