To test this, we introduce Trajectory Replay via Concept-Basis Reconstruction, a framework that transfers refusal interventions from donor to target models, spanning diverse architectures (e.g., Dense to MoE) and training regimes, without using target-side refusal supervision. By aligning layers via concept fingerprints and reconstructing refusal directions using a shared ``recipe'' of concept atoms, we map the donor's ablation trajectory into the target's semantic space. To preserve capabilities, we introduce a weight-SVD stability guard that projects interventions away from high-variance weight subspaces to prevent collateral damage. Our evaluation across 8 model pairs (including GPT-OSS-20B and GLM-4) confirms that these transferred recipes consistently attenuate refusal while maintaining performance, providing strong evidence for the semantic universality of safety alignment."}

To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule.

However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization."}

For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration.

Existing studies have primarily evaluated confidence in single-turn, static settings, overlooking the coupling between confidence and correctness as clinical evidence accumulates during real consultations, which limits their support for reliable decision-making. We propose the first benchmark for assessing confidence in multi-turn interaction during realistic medical consultations. Our benchmark unifies three types of medical data for open-ended diagnostic generation and introduces an information sufficiency gradient to characterize the confidence-correctness dynamics as evidence increases. We implement and compare 27 representative methods on this benchmark; two key insights emerge: (1) medical data amplifies the inherent limitations of token-level and consistency-level confidence methods, and (2) medical reasoning must be evaluated for both diagnostic accuracy and information completeness. Based on these insights, we present MedConf, an evidence-grounded linguistic self-assessment framework that constructs symptom profiles via retrieval-augmented generation, aligns patient information with supporting, missing, and contradictory relations, and aggregates them into an interpretable confidence estimate through weighted integration. Across two LLMs and three medical datasets, MedConf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both AUROC and Pearson correlation coefficient metrics, maintaining stable performance under conditions of information insufficiency and multimorbidity. These results demonstrate that information adequacy is a key determinant of credible medical confidence modeling, providing a new pathway toward building more reliable and interpretable large medical models.'}

Through a dialectical reasoning process, the framework transforms the potential weakness of persona assignment into a strength for bias mitigation.

To this end, we present YuFeng-XGuard, a reasoning-centric guardrail model family designed to perform multi-dimensional risk perception for LLM interactions. Instead of producing opaque binary judgments, YuFeng-XGuard generates structured risk predictions, including explicit risk categories and configurable confidence scores, accompanied by natural language explanations that expose the underlying reasoning process. This formulation enables safety decisions that are both actionable and interpretable. To balance decision latency and explanatory depth, we adopt a tiered inference paradigm that performs an initial risk decision based on the first decoded token, while preserving ondemand explanatory reasoning when required. In addition, we introduce a dynamic policy mechanism that decouples risk perception from policy enforcement, allowing safety policies to be adjusted without model retraining. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of public safety benchmarks demonstrate that YuFeng-XGuard achieves stateof-the-art performance while maintaining strong efficiency-efficacy trade-offs. We release YuFeng-XGuard as an open model family, including both a full-capacity variant and a lightweight version, to support a wide range of deployment scenarios.'}

Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap.

This paper presents three contributions: (1) Natural Length Distribution Analysis: We use each sample's natural token length without truncation or padding, providing stronger causal evidence that degradation results from context length itself.

Although effective, these methods particularly GCG are computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for organisations with constrained resources. This paper introduces a resource-efficient adversarial prompting approach that eliminates the need for retraining by matching new prompts to a database of pre-trained adversarial prompts. A dataset of 1,000 prompts was classified into seven harm-related categories, and GCG, PEZ, and GBDA were evaluated on a Llama 3 8B model to identify the most effective attack method per category. Results reveal a correlation between prompt type and algorithm effectiveness.

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.'}

While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.'}

Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents."}

In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated.

For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.'}

Rather than simply muting or replacing a single word, our approach transforms the tone, intensity, and sentiment, thus not altering just the lyrics, but how it is expressed. We present a comparative analysis of four selected English songs and their transformed counterparts, evaluating changes through both acoustic and sentiment-based lenses. Our findings indicate that Gen-AI significantly reduces vocal aggressiveness, with acoustic analysis showing improvements in Harmonic to Noise Ratio, Cepstral Peak Prominence, and Shimmer. Sentiment analysis reduced aggression by 63.3-85.6\\% across artists, with major improvements in chorus sections (up to 88.6\\% reduction).

Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals."}

Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.'}

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.'}

The inherent challenges include ASMR's subtle, often unvoiced characteristics and the demand for zero-shot speaker adaptation. In this paper, we introduce DeepASMR, the first framework designed for zero-shot ASMR generation. We demonstrate that a single short snippet of a speaker's ordinary, read-style speech is sufficient to synthesize high-fidelity ASMR in their voice, eliminating the need for whispered training data from the target speaker. Methodologically, we first identify that discrete speech tokens provide a soft factorization of ASMR style from speaker timbre. Leveraging this insight, we propose a two-stage pipeline incorporating a Large Language Model (LLM) for content-style encoding and a flow-matching acoustic decoder for timbre reconstruction. Furthermore, we contribute DeepASMR-DB, a comprehensive 670-hour English-Chinese multi-speaker ASMR speech corpus, and introduce a novel evaluation protocol integrating objective metrics, human listening tests, LLM-based scoring and unvoiced speech analysis. Extensive experiments confirm that DeepASMR achieves state-of-the-art naturalness and style fidelity in ASMR generation for anyone of any voice, while maintaining competitive performance on normal speech synthesis."}

This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents."}

While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency.

However, most existing systems are designed for English-speaking users interacting via keyboards, which limits accessibility in multilingual and voice-first settings, particularly in regions like India. Voice-based interfaces offer a more inclusive modality, but spoken queries involving code present unique challenges due to the presence of non-standard English usage, domain-specific vocabulary, and custom identifiers such as variable and function names, often combined with code-mixed expressions. In this work, we develop a multilingual speech-driven framework for code understanding that accepts spoken queries in a user native language, transcribes them using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), applies code-aware ASR output refinement using Large Language Models (LLMs), and interfaces with code models to perform tasks such as code question answering and code retrieval through benchmarks such as CodeSearchNet, CoRNStack, and CodeQA. Focusing on four widely spoken Indic languages and English, we systematically characterize how transcription errors impact downstream task performance. We also identified key failure modes in ASR for code and demonstrated that LLM-guided refinement significantly improves performance across both transcription and code understanding stages. Our findings underscore the need for code-sensitive adaptations in speech interfaces and offer a practical solution for building robust, multilingual voice-driven programming tools.'}

To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD."}

While recent work suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate human psychometric responses from qualitative data, it remains unclear whether they can accurately and stably model neurodevelopmental traits rather than broad personality characteristics. This study examines whether LLMs can generate psychometric responses that approximate those of real individuals when grounded in a structured qualitative interview, and whether such simulations are sensitive to variations in trait intensity. Twenty-six adults completed a 29-item open-ended interview and four standardized self-report measures (ASRS, BAARS-IV, AQ, RAADS-R). Two LLMs (GPT-4o and Qwen3-235B-A22B) were prompted to infer an individual psychological profile from interview content and then respond to each questionnaire in-role. Accuracy, reliability, and sensitivity were assessed using group-level comparisons, error metrics, exact-match scoring, and a randomized baseline. Both models outperformed random responses across instruments, with GPT-4o showing higher accuracy and reproducibility. Simulated responses closely matched human data for ASRS, BAARS-IV, and RAADS-R, while the AQ revealed subscale-specific limitations, particularly in Attention to Detail. Overall, the findings indicate that interview-grounded LLMs can produce coherent and above-chance simulations of neurodevelopmental traits, supporting their potential use as synthetic participants in early-stage psychometric research, while highlighting clear domain-specific constraints.'}

This study introduces a real-time AI-facilitated multimodal feedback system that integrates structured textual explanations with dynamic multimedia resources, including the retrieved most relevant slide page references and streaming AI audio narration. In an online crowdsourcing experiment, we compared this system against fixed business-as-usual feedback by educators across three dimensions: (1) learning effectiveness, (2) learner engagement, (3) perceived feedback quality and value. Results showed that AI multimodal feedback achieved learning gains equivalent to original educator feedback while significantly outperforming it on perceived clarity, specificity, conciseness, motivation, satisfaction, and reducing cognitive load, with comparable correctness, trust, and acceptance. Process logs revealed distinct engagement patterns: for multiple-choice questions, educator feedback encouraged more submissions; for open-ended questions, AI-facilitated targeted suggestions lowered revision barriers and promoted iterative improvement. These findings highlight the potential of AI multimodal feedback to provide scalable, real-time, and context-aware support that both reduces instructor workload and enhances student experience.'}
