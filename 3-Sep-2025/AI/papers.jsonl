This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium.

In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL.

A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational requirements.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.'}

It employs reward and policy mechanisms that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance AI-driven scientific discovery.'}

In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\\% better than the previously presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering, serving as a call to action for future research.

These three conditions -- generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.'}

Existing fairness evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms. This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert, defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale, controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework - Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more effectively under various settings.

Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself."}

Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum.

The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student.

We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model\'s behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.'}

Deployed maliciously or erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework."}

This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts."}

We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated, operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-") during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in commonsense reasoning.'}

Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore, we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.'}

However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing, performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained. As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata. Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series, show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging cases with higher part counts (>10)."}

Since computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees. However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks, resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.'}

Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.\nIn this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.'}

However, their dependence on static training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.'}

Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.'}

To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation.

We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses.

Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints.

However, the optimization of Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving MDPs with other fractional objectives.'}

However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines.

However, hallucination issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information. By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities.

This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\\% accuracy compared to 18.8\\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models.

Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series.

This report explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others. Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly used food additives in ice cream formulation.

We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation to real-world productivity."}

Such multimodal data can be used to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes, such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents, observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents occurring at the same time and location.'}

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but lacking data used for training LLMs.'}

RAG raises latency and engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS): curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and failures, and proposes typed deltas $\\Delta K=(\\Delta S,\\Delta U,\\Delta T)$ over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled, evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved 4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool creation, and low-latency deployment.'}

However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters effective exploration without sacrificing precision.'}

Here, agents are instantiated with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high) datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth, emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust, emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt emotional integration."}

Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation.

Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages.

Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at this https URL.'}

Drawing on the theory of comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a selection function to be representable as a strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability orders.

To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.'}

Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.

However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.'}

Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step problems and complex decision-making.

Implicit reasoning brings advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to computational strategies.

Moreover, they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks.

In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses.

To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations, conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics.

A key challenge for simple swarms lies in maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing. Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the classical decentralized control challenges.

Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics."}

This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development.

To facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists' ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these interventions."}

In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines.

Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian, while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence, with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.'}

To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation and data utility remains a critical challenge.\nTo address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in terms of sample quality and diversity.'}

We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.'}

These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings.

While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits.

In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing."}

However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.\nWe empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration."}

To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.'}

Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization.

Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives.

This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables, as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use and risk perception.

To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts.

As a result, these agents do not improve with more experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second, using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely. To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early (e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks."}

One such approach to few-shot imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications."}

Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.'}

For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo."}

The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry.'}

The focus of this paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques.

However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training, leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting.

This paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum learning.'}

This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach.

These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing.

Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients, providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks trained on different distributions.

However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals, the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore, to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.'}

Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \\textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems."}

Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms.

Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.'}

This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources.

Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning.

While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals (PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach, based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling, representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on high-frequency data.

Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models.

With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time."}

In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution, etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting, parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose non-negligible threats to system security and user safety."}

Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets.

RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction, this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning, where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.'}

But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters.

Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction.

In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events.

However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\\%, 68.11\\% and 61.08\\%, respectively.

Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.'}

Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.'}

This method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation, creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns, we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels, revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster formation with power-law size distributions.

This paper is concerned with the more challenging task of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.

Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results.

However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning, such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients' behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients. Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting."}

Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments."}

Ilanthenral', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00955', 'abstract': 'Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.\nThis paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.\nUnlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.\nResults on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.\nIn most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.'}

The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.'}

Tahaei', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00935', 'abstract': "Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However, these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT (Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens, each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering comparable results on long sequence benchmarks."}

This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases."}

What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g. note-taking while reading).

The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.'}

However, rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task, which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.'}

To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.'}

Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture, TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM methods."}

This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments.

The proposed multiplier is employed within a custom convolution layer and evaluated on neural network tasks, including image recognition and denoising. Hardware evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design achieves up to 30.24% energy savings compared to the best among existing multipliers.

However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature\'s firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.'}

Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.'}

We posit that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods.

Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.'}

With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.'}

Previous research has mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others. This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance. Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being in online environments."}

PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals during feature generation.

However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable.

To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.

We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues.

We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.'}

However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process, particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness, and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for solving inverse problems in molecular science.'}

Thomas Hou, Wenjing Lou', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00634', 'abstract': 'Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.\nTo address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead.'}

The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features.

First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated, and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured [Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting.

To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that CUFL achieves superior performance compared to relevant baselines. Code is available at this https URL.'}

Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation."}

However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \\textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.'}

Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance."}

It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).

To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.

One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and cannot be adequately explained.\nThis paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.\nSeveral numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network.

However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.'}

The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods."}

Therefore, Task and Motion Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs, referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph, which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence, TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii) bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of challenges in the benchmarks.'}

However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal distributions.

Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture.

We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs.

We present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting, automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2 addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks and end-to-end performance.

While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks."}

For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning.

The attack exploits this fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked" version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers.

Unlike virtual AI, EAI can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks. Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.'}

ERMI internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across 15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial prediction.

As analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past.

We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\\% at just 10\\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\\%.

Central to our approach is the integration of domain ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data, which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity.

To enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph (IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).

This research looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity. The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date.

To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation.

As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation.

Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness. Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics. Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in the performance of LoRA training."}

{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2508.10946', 'title': 'IPG: Incremental Patch Generation for Generalized Adversarial Patch Training', 'authors': 'Wonho Lee, Hyunsik Na, Jisu Lee, Daeseon Choi', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10946', 'abstract': "The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments."}
