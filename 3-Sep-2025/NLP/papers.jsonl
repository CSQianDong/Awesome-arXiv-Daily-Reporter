As this data is predominantly sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently, LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures. This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15% on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be domain-dependent.'}

This creates a tension: while post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity. At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning, encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as higher-quality responses.'}

Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\\$p\\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\\$p\\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\\$p\\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\\$p\\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at this https URL.'}

This study illustrates how AI breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci\'s method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly documented in his publication: a passage from Dante\'s La Vita Nuova, translated from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire\'s Zadig, translated from French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci\'s system thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci\'s historical status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history of the field is understood.'}

To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$ can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning.

We introduce an automated framework that audits models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements, generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models.

Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to 17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and results are available at this https URL'}

However, existing methods have limitations when dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.'}

It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results.

In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines.

Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English.

We focus on disputes from two specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i) identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak.

To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.'}

Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.\nTo address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.\nOur contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words, stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection, which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.'}

Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring, overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion. To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring. TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.

The approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information, MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support [16].'}

Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \\textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers.

UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage. Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction, semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages.

When LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs' opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore, changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary population.

This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both precedent and policy.

From these, we extract a reasoning vector: $v_{\\text{reason}} = \\theta_{\\text{GRPO}} - \\theta_{\\text{SFT}}$. We hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities.

We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors.

Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.

This problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem. Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge. However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\\%. These results indicate that growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.'}

As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.'}

First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.

Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time.

However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.'}

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content. However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA, leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG, resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs.

In this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure.

We investigate this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap to become entrenched in the modern grammar."}

To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic variation between instances.

Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios.

Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised) generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL) from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL performance.'}

To address these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when no useful evidence exists.

We frame representational societal bias assessment as an image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse, Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models: closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity. All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black, White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level strategies.

In this work, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile, we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs, improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets."}

This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.

Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.'}

However, effectively incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to (1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs\' constrained context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews most relevant to the user\'s current decision context. To address these challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.

These studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF performance.

The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local, position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2 benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset.

In this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like" and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%, indicating heightened safety compliance.

Existing approaches typically encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information, while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations. A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.'}

In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool. Source code is available at this https URL.'}

Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.'}

Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy.

But this also raises a key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.'}

From a cognitive science perspective, an informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup, and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang, creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\\% in Camlang, far below human performance at 87\\%, while other state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human metalinguistic competence.'}

In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation."}

To overcome this, we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the most contextually significant tokens.

However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy.

While both approaches prove effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment."}

This point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities, enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach. The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task. To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported.

However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs.

While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning, not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models.

While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios."}

Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.'}

At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support.

In this work, we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes, and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237, WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction settings.

This patchwise design simplifies the architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid. To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for 16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL.

In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions - forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications. Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic principles.

In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.'}

Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r = 0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged 288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and 59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects.'}

To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself."}

This study systematically investigates the structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.'}

In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.

Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning.

Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a 1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset."}

Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.\nIn this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.'}

Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation.

These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical legal applications.'}

By preserving the MLP module and reducing the attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while routing fewer tokens to full attention.

However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection. Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibrating LLM pruning.

We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: this https URL'}

Reliance on proprietary APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across 150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13), with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment evaluation.'}

Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.'}

We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\\% at just 10\\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\\%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance."}

In this work, we introduce ChipChat, a novel low-latency CS that overcomes traditional bottlenecks through architectural innovations and streaming optimizations. Our system integrates streaming (a) conversational speech recognition with mixture-of-experts, (b) state-action augmented LLM, (c) text-to-speech synthesis, (d) neural vocoder, and (e) speaker modeling. Implemented using MLX, ChipChat achieves sub-second response latency on a Mac Studio without dedicated GPUs, while preserving user privacy through complete on-device processing. Our work shows that strategically redesigned CSs can overcome their historical latency limitations, offering a promising path forward for practical voice-based AI agents.'}

While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.'}

How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.'}

However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \\ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \\texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \\texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \\texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\\%$, $15.52\\%$, $51.52\\%$, $1.83\\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \\texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.'}
