Felix Handte, Danielle Rozenblit, Victor Zhang, Kevin Zhang, Yaelle Goldschlag, Jennifer Lee, Daniel Riegel, Stan Angelov, Nadav Rotem', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03203', 'abstract': "Research in general-purpose lossless compression over the last decade has largely found improvements in compression ratio that come at great cost to resource utilization and processing throughput. However, most production workloads require high throughput and low resource utilization, so most research systems have seen little adoption. Instead, real world improvements in compression are increasingly often realized by building application-specific compressors which can exploit knowledge about the structure and semantics of the data being compressed. These systems easily outperform even the best generic compressors, but application-specific compression schemes are not without drawbacks. They are inherently limited in applicability and are difficult to maintain and deploy.\nWe show that these challenges can be overcome with a new way of thinking about compression. We propose the ``graph model'' of compression, a new theoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph of modular codecs. This motivates OpenZL, an implementation of this model that compresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which can be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid development of tailored compressors with minimal code, its universal decoder eliminates deployment lag, and its investment in a well-vetted standard component library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to state-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world datasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements in size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days. OpenZL thus represents an advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data compression for modern data-intensive applications."}

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself."}

Existing systems often rely on dense retrieval (DR), which struggles to interpret challenging queries that express broad (e.g., "cities for youth friendly activities") or indirect (e.g., "cities for a high school graduation trip") user intents. While query reformulation (QR) has been widely adopted to improve such systems, existing QR methods tend to focus only on expanding the range of query subtopics (breadth) or elaborating on the potential meaning of a query (depth), but not both. In this paper, we propose EQR (Elaborative Subtopic Query Reformulation), a large language model-based QR method that combines both breadth and depth by generating potential query subtopics with information-rich elaborations. We also introduce three new natural language recommendation benchmarks in travel, hotel, and restaurant domains to establish evaluation of NL recommendation with challenging queries. Experiments show EQR substantially outperforms state-of-the-art QR methods in various evaluation metrics, highlighting that a simple yet effective QR approach can significantly improve NL recommender systems for queries with broad and indirect user intents.'}

Existing QV-based QPP methods generate QVs facilitated by either query expansion or non-contextual embeddings, which may introduce topical drifts and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose a method that retrieves QVs from a training set (e.g., MS MARCO) for a given target query of QPP. To achieve a high recall in retrieving queries with the most similar information needs as the target query from a training set, we extend the directly retrieved QVs (1-hop QVs) by a second retrieval using their denoted relevant documents (which yields 2-hop QVs). Our experiments, conducted on TREC DL'19 and DL'20, show that the QPP methods with QVs retrieved by our method outperform the best-performing existing generated-QV-based QPP approaches by as much as around 20\\%, on neural ranking models like MonoT5."}

When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ustomizing \\underline{\\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \\underline{\\textbf{O}}n-device model for sequential \\underline{\\textbf{R}}ecommendation with \\underline{\\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer, filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.'}

The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.\nThe most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines."}

Yet, challenges persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges, assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1). StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability in multi-hop QA.'}

We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2 vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality, scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.'}
