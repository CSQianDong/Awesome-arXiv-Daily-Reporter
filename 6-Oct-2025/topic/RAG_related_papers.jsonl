This paper introduces AgenticRAG, a novel framework that combines tool-augmented foundation models with retrieval-augmented generation for zero-shot explainable recommendations. Our approach integrates external tool invocation, knowledge retrieval, and chain-of-thought reasoning to create autonomous recommendation agents capable of transparent decision-making without task-specific training. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that AgenticRAG achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with NDCG@10 improvements of 0.4\\% on Amazon Electronics, 0.8\\% on MovieLens-1M, and 1.6\\% on Yelp datasets. The framework exhibits superior explainability while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to traditional methods.'}

Yet, challenges persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges, assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1). StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability in multi-hop QA.'}

The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.\nThe most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines."}

This strategy allows us to overcome problems such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. The evaluation of Geolog-IA's performance with the BLEU metric reaches an average of 0.87, indicating high consistency and accuracy in the responses generated. The system offers an intuitive, web-based interface that facilitates interaction and information retrieval for directors, teachers, students, and administrative staff at the institution.

While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself."}

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \\textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.'}

The growing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous.\nThe framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures. Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with authoritative code review tools.'}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2510.02549', 'title': 'Knowledge-Graph Based RAG System Evaluation Framework', 'authors': 'Sicheng Dong, Vahid Zolfaghari, Nenad Petrovic, Alois Knoll', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02549', 'abstract': "Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research."}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2510.02811', 'title': 'A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality Assessment from Social Media', 'authors': 'Matej Gjurković', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02811', 'abstract': "Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large, personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA -- collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000 users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage. Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts."}
