# Training-Induced Bias Toward LLM-Generated Content in Dense Retrieval 

**Authors**: William Xion, Wolfgang Nejdl

**Abstract**: Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called "source bias", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.

# EST: Towards Efficient Scaling Laws in Click-Through Rate Prediction via Unified Modeling 

**Authors**: Mingyang Liu, Yong Bai, Zhangming Chan, Sishuo Chen, Xiang-Rong Sheng, Han Zhu, Jian Xu, Xinyang Chen

**Abstract**: Efficiently scaling industrial Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction has recently attracted significant research attention. Existing approaches typically employ early aggregation of user behaviors to maintain efficiency. However, such non-unified or partially unified modeling creates an information bottleneck by discarding fine-grained, token-level signals essential for unlocking scaling gains. In this work, we revisit the fundamental distinctions between CTR prediction and Large Language Models (LLMs), identifying two critical properties: the asymmetry in information density between behavioral and non-behavioral features, and the modality-specific priors of content-rich signals. Accordingly, we propose the Efficiently Scalable Transformer (EST), which achieves fully unified modeling by processing all raw inputs in a single sequence without lossy aggregation. EST integrates two modules: Lightweight Cross-Attention (LCA), which prunes redundant self-interactions to focus on high-impact cross-feature dependencies, and Content Sparse Attention (CSA), which utilizes content similarity to dynamically select high-signal behaviors. Extensive experiments show that EST exhibits a stable and efficient power-law scaling relationship, enabling predictable performance gains with model scale. Deployed on Taobao's display advertising platform, EST significantly outperforms production baselines, delivering a 3.27\% RPM (Revenue Per Mile) increase and a 1.22\% CTR lift, establishing a practical pathway for scalable industrial CTR prediction models.

# A Cognitive Distribution and Behavior-Consistent Framework for Black-Box Attacks on Recommender Systems 

**Authors**: Hongyue Zhan, Mingming Li, Dongqin Liu, Hui Wang, Yaning Zhang, Xi Zhou, Honglei Lv, Jiao Dai, Jizhong Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10633)  

**Abstract**: With the growing deployment of sequential recommender systems in e-commerce and other fields, their black-box interfaces raise security concerns: models are vulnerable to extraction and subsequent adversarial manipulation. Existing black-box extraction attacks primarily rely on hard labels or pairwise learning, often ignoring the importance of ranking positions, which results in incomplete knowledge transfer. Moreover, adversarial sequences generated via pure gradient methods lack semantic consistency with real user behavior, making them easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a dual-enhanced attack framework. First, drawing on primacy effects and position bias, we introduce a cognitive distribution-driven extraction mechanism that maps discrete rankings into continuous value distributions with position-aware decay, thereby advancing from order alignment to cognitive distribution alignment. Second, we design a behavior-aware noisy item generation strategy that jointly optimizes collaborative signals and gradient signals. This ensures both semantic coherence and statistical stealth while effectively promoting target item rankings. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both attack success rate and evasion rate, validating the value of integrating cognitive modeling and behavioral consistency for secure recommender systems.

# S-GRec: Personalized Semantic-Aware Generative Recommendation with Asymmetric Advantage 

**Authors**: Jie Jiang, Hongbo Tang, Wenjie Wu, Yangru Huang, Zhenmao Li, Qian Li, Changping Wang, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu

**Abstract**: Generative recommendation models sequence generation to produce items end-to-end, but training from behavioral logs often provides weak supervision on underlying user intent. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) offer rich semantic priors that could supply such supervision, direct adoption in industrial recommendation is hindered by two obstacles: semantic signals can conflict with platform business objectives, and LLM inference is prohibitively expensive at scale. This paper presents S-GRec, a semantic-aware framework that decouples an online lightweight generator from an offline LLM-based semantic judge for train-time supervision. S-GRec introduces a two-stage Personalized Semantic Judge (PSJ) that produces interpretable aspect evidence and learns user-conditional aggregation from pairwise feedback, yielding stable semantic rewards. To prevent semantic supervision from deviating from business goals, Asymmetric Advantage Policy Optimization (A2PO) anchors optimization on business rewards (e.g., eCPM) and injects semantic advantages only when they are consistent. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale production system validate both effectiveness and scalability, including statistically significant gains in CTR and a 1.19\% lift in GMV in online A/B tests, without requiring real-time LLM inference.

# Campaign-2-PT-RAG: LLM-Guided Semantic Product Type Attribution for Scalable Campaign Ranking 

**Authors**: Yiming Che, Mansi Mane, Keerthi Gopalakrishnan, Parisa Kaghazgaran, Murali Mohana Krishna Dandu, Archana Venkatachalapathy, Sinduja Subramaniam, Yokila Arora, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10577)  

**Abstract**: E-commerce campaign ranking models require large-scale training labels indicating which users purchased due to campaign influence. However, generating these labels is challenging because campaigns use creative, thematic language that does not directly map to product purchases. Without clear product-level attribution, supervised learning for campaign optimization remains limited. We present \textbf{Campaign-2-PT-RAG}, a scalable label generation framework that constructs user--campaign purchase labels by inferring which product types (PTs) each campaign promotes. The framework first interprets campaign content using large language models (LLMs) to capture implicit intent, then retrieves candidate PTs through semantic search over the platform taxonomy. A structured LLM-based classifier evaluates each PT's relevance, producing a campaign-specific product coverage set. User purchases matching these PTs generate positive training labels for downstream ranking models. This approach reframes the ambiguous attribution problem into a tractable semantic alignment task, enabling scalable and consistent supervision for downstream tasks such as campaign ranking optimization in production e-commerce environments. Experiments on internal and synthetic datasets, validated against expert-annotated campaign--PT mappings, show that our LLM-assisted approach generates high-quality labels with 78--90% precision while maintaining over 99% recall.

# Boundary-Aware Multi-Behavior Dynamic Graph Transformer for Sequential Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jingsong Su, Xuetao Ma, Mingming Li, Qiannan Zhu, Yu Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10493)  

**Abstract**: In the landscape of contemporary recommender systems, user-item interactions are inherently dynamic and sequential, often characterized by various behaviors. Prior research has explored the modeling of user preferences through sequential interactions and the user-item interaction graph, utilizing advanced techniques such as graph neural networks and transformer-based architectures. However, these methods typically fall short in simultaneously accounting for the dynamic nature of graph topologies and the sequential pattern of interactions in user preference models. Moreover, they often fail to adequately capture the multiple user behavior boundaries during model optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a boundary-aware Multi-Behavioral Dynamic Graph Transformer (MB-DGT) model that dynamically refines the graph structure to reflect the evolving patterns of user behaviors and interactions. Our model involves a transformer-based dynamic graph aggregator for user preference modeling, which assimilates the changing graph structure and the sequence of user behaviors. This integration yields a more comprehensive and dynamic representation of user preferences. For model optimization, we implement a user-specific multi-behavior loss function that delineates the interest boundaries among different behaviors, thereby enriching the personalized learning of user preferences. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets indicate that our model consistently delivers remarkable recommendation performance.

# ChainRec: An Agentic Recommender Learning to Route Tool Chains for Diverse and Evolving Interests 

**Authors**: Fuchun Li, Qian Li, Xingyu Gao, Bocheng Pan, Yang Wu, Jun Zhang, Huan Yu, Jie Jiang, Jinsheng Xiao, Hailong Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10490)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into recommender systems, motivating recent interest in agentic and reasoning-based recommendation. However, most existing approaches still rely on fixed workflows, applying the same reasoning procedure across diverse recommendation scenarios. In practice, user contexts vary substantially-for example, in cold-start settings or during interest shifts, so an agent should adaptively decide what evidence to gather next rather than following a scripted process. To address this, we propose ChainRec, an agentic recommender that uses a planner to dynamically select reasoning tools. ChainRec builds a standardized Tool Agent Library from expert trajectories. It then trains a planner using supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization to dynamically select tools, decide their order, and determine when to stop. Experiments on AgentRecBench across Amazon, Yelp, and Goodreads show that ChainRec consistently improves Avg HR@{1,3,5} over strong baselines, with especially notable gains in cold-start and evolving-interest scenarios. Ablation studies further validate the importance of tool standardization and preference-optimized planning.

# Compute Only Once: UG-Separation for Efficient Large Recommendation Models 

**Authors**: Hui Lu, Zheng Chai, Shipeng Bai, Hao Zhang, Zhifang Fan, Kunmin Bai, Yingwen Wu, Bingzheng Wei, Xiang Sun, Ziyan Gong, Tianyi Liu, Hua Chen, Deping Xie, Zhongkai Chen, Zhiliang Guo, Qiwei Chen, Yuchao Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10455)  

**Abstract**: Driven by scaling laws, recommender systems increasingly rely on large-scale models to capture complex feature interactions and user behaviors, but this trend also leads to prohibitive training and inference costs. While long-sequence models(e.g., LONGER) can reuse user-side computation through KV caching, such reuse is difficult in dense feature interaction architectures(e.g., RankMixer), where user and group (candidate item) features are deeply entangled across layers. In this work, we propose User-Group Separation (UG-Sep), a novel framework that enables reusable user-side computation in dense interaction models for the first time. UG-Sep introduces a masking mechanism that explicitly disentangles user-side and item-side information flows within token-mixing layers, ensuring that a subset of tokens to preserve purely user-side representations across layers. This design enables corresponding token computations to be reused across multiple samples, significantly reducing redundant inference cost. To compensate for potential expressiveness loss induced by masking, we further propose an Information Compensation strategy that adaptively reconstructs suppressed user-item interactions. Moreover, as UG-Sep substantially reduces user-side FLOPs and exposes memory-bound components, we incorporate W8A16 (8-bit weight, 16-bit activation) weight-only quantization to alleviate memory bandwidth bottlenecks and achieve additional acceleration. We conduct extensive offline evaluations and large-scale online A/B experiments at ByteDance, demonstrating that UG-Sep reduces inference latency by up to 20 percent without degrading online user experience or commercial metrics across multiple business scenarios, including feed recommendation and advertising systems.

# End-to-End Semantic ID Generation for Generative Advertisement Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jie Jiang, Xinxun Zhang, Enming Zhang, Yuling Xiong, Jun Zhang, Jingwen Wang, Huan Yu, Yuxiang Wang, Hao Wang, Xiao Yan, Jiawei Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10445)  

**Abstract**: Generative Recommendation (GR) has excelled by framing recommendation as next-token prediction. This paradigm relies on Semantic IDs (SIDs) to tokenize large-scale items into discrete sequences. Existing GR approaches predominantly generate SIDs via Residual Quantization (RQ), where items are encoded into embeddings and then quantized to discrete SIDs. However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations: 1) Objective misalignment and semantic degradation stemming from the two-stage compression; 2) Error accumulation inherent in the structure of RQ. To address these limitations, we propose UniSID, a Unified SID generation framework for generative advertisement recommendation. Specifically, we jointly optimize embeddings and SIDs in an end-to-end manner from raw advertising data, enabling semantic information to flow directly into the SID space and thus addressing the inherent limitations of the two-stage cascading compression paradigm. To capture fine-grained semantics, a multi-granularity contrastive learning strategy is introduced to align distinct items across SID levels. Finally, a summary-based ad reconstruction mechanism is proposed to encourage SIDs to capture high-level semantic information that is not explicitly present in advertising contexts. Experiments demonstrate that UniSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SID generation methods, yielding up to a 4.62% improvement in Hit Rate metrics across downstream advertising scenarios compared to the strongest baseline.

# GeoGR: A Generative Retrieval Framework for Spatio-Temporal Aware POI Recommendation 

**Authors**: Fangye Wang, Haowen Lin, Yifang Yuan, Siyuan Wang, Xiaojiang Zhou, Song Yang, Pengjie Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10411)  

**Abstract**: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) prediction is a fundamental task in location-based services, especially critical for large-scale navigation platforms like AMAP that serve billions of users across diverse lifestyle scenarios. While recent POI recommendation approaches based on SIDs have achieved promising, they struggle in complex, sparse real-world environments due to two key limitations: (1) inadequate modeling of high-quality SIDs that capture cross-category spatio-temporal collaborative relationships, and (2) poor alignment between large language models (LLMs) and the POI recommendation task. To this end, we propose GeoGR, a geographic generative recommendation framework tailored for navigation-based LBS like AMAP, which perceives users' contextual state changes and enables intent-aware POI recommendation. GeoGR features a two-stage design: (i) a geo-aware SID tokenization pipeline that explicitly learns spatio-temporal collaborative semantic representations via geographically constrained co-visited POI pairs, contrastive learning, and iterative refinement; and (ii) a multi-stage LLM training strategy that aligns non-native SID tokens through multiple template-based continued pre-training(CPT) and enables autoregressive POI generation via supervised fine-tuning(SFT). Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate GeoGR's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, deployment on the AMAP platform, serving millions of users with multiple online metrics boosting, confirms its practical effectiveness and scalability in production.

# Single-Turn LLM Reformulation Powered Multi-Stage Hybrid Re-Ranking for Tip-of-the-Tongue Known-Item Retrieval 

**Authors**: Debayan Mukhopadhyay, Utshab Kumar Ghosh, Shubham Chatterjee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10321)  

**Abstract**: Retrieving known items from vague descriptions, Tip-of-the-Tongue (ToT) retrieval, remains a significant challenge. We propose using a single call to a generic 8B-parameter LLM for query reformulation, bridging the gap between ill-formed ToT queries and specific information needs. This method is particularly effective where standard Pseudo-Relevance Feedback fails due to poor initial recall. Crucially, our LLM is not fine-tuned for ToT or specific domains, demonstrating that gains stem from our prompting strategy rather than model specialization. Rewritten queries feed a multi-stage pipeline: sparse retrieval (BM25), dense/late-interaction reranking (Contriever, E5-large-v2, ColBERTv2), monoT5 cross-encoding, and list-wise reranking (Qwen 2.5 72B). Experiments on 2025 TREC-ToT datasets show that while raw queries yield poor performance, our lightweight pre-retrieval transformation improves Recall by 20.61%. Subsequent reranking improves nDCG@10 by 33.88%, MRR by 29.92%, and MAP@10 by 29.98%, offering a cost-effective intervention that unlocks the potential of downstream rankers.

# MLDocRAG: Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Yongyue Zhang, Yaxiong Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10271)  

**Abstract**: Understanding multimodal long-context documents that comprise multimodal chunks such as paragraphs, figures, and tables is challenging due to (1) cross-modal heterogeneity to localize relevant information across modalities, (2) cross-page reasoning to aggregate dispersed evidence across pages. To address these challenges, we are motivated to adopt a query-centric formulation that projects cross-modal and cross-page information into a unified query representation space, with queries acting as abstract semantic surrogates for heterogeneous multimodal content. In this paper, we propose a Multimodal Long-Context Document Retrieval Augmented Generation (MLDocRAG) framework that leverages a Multimodal Chunk-Query Graph (MCQG) to organize multimodal document content around semantically rich, answerable queries. MCQG is constructed via a multimodal document expansion process that generates fine-grained queries from heterogeneous document chunks and links them to their corresponding content across modalities and pages. This graph-based structure enables selective, query-centric retrieval and structured evidence aggregation, thereby enhancing grounding and coherence in long-context multimodal question answering. Experiments on datasets MMLongBench-Doc and LongDocURL demonstrate that MLDocRAG consistently improves retrieval quality and answer accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for long-context multimodal understanding.

# JAG: Joint Attribute Graphs for Filtered Nearest Neighbor Search 

**Authors**: Haike Xu, Guy Blelloch, Laxman Dhulipala, Lars Gottesbüren, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub Łącki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10258)  

**Abstract**: Despite filtered nearest neighbor search being a fundamental task in modern vector search systems, the performance of existing algorithms is highly sensitive to query selectivity and filter type. In particular, existing solutions excel either at specific filter categories (e.g., label equality) or within narrow selectivity bands (e.g., pre-filtering for low selectivity) and are therefore a poor fit for practical deployments that demand generalization to new filter types and unknown query selectivities. In this paper, we propose JAG (Joint Attribute Graphs), a graph-based algorithm designed to deliver robust performance across the entire selectivity spectrum and support diverse filter types. Our key innovation is the introduction of attribute and filter distances, which transform binary filter constraints into continuous navigational guidance. By constructing a proximity graph that jointly optimizes for both vector similarity and attribute proximity, JAG prevents navigational dead-ends and allows JAG to consistently outperform prior graph-based filtered nearest neighbor search methods. Our experimental results across five datasets and four filter types (Label, Range, Subset, Boolean) demonstrate that JAG significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in both throughput and recall robustness.

# Diffusion-Pretrained Dense and Contextual Embeddings 

**Authors**: Sedigheh Eslami, Maksim Gaiduk, Markus Krimmel, Louis Milliken, Bo Wang, Denis Bykov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11151)  

**Abstract**: In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.

# MoToRec: Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jialin Liu, Zhaorui Zhang, Ray C.C. Cheung  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11062)  

**Abstract**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have revolutionized recommender systems by effectively modeling complex user-item interactions, yet data sparsity and the item cold-start problem significantly impair performance, particularly for new items with limited or no interaction history. While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.

# GraphSeek: Next-Generation Graph Analytics with LLMs 

**Authors**: Maciej Besta, Łukasz Jarmocik, Orest Hrycyna, Shachar Klaiman, Konrad Mączka, Robert Gerstenberger, Jürgen Müller, Piotr Nyczyk, Hubert Niewiadomski, Torsten Hoefler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.11052)  

**Abstract**: Graphs are foundational across domains but remain hard to use without deep expertise. LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs.

# DeepImageSearch: Benchmarking Multimodal Agents for Context-Aware Image Retrieval in Visual Histories 

**Authors**: Chenlong Deng, Mengjie Deng, Junjie Wu, Dun Zeng, Teng Wang, Qingsong Xie, Jiadeng Huang, Shengjie Ma, Changwang Zhang, Zhaoxiang Wang, Jun Wang, Yutao Zhu, Zhicheng Dou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10809)  

**Abstract**: Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.

# VulReaD: Knowledge-Graph-guided Software Vulnerability Reasoning and Detection 

**Authors**: Samal Mukhtar, Yinghua Yao, Zhu Sun, Mustafa Mustafa, Yew Soon Ong, Youcheng Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10787)  

**Abstract**: Software vulnerability detection (SVD) is a critical challenge in modern systems. Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.

# Equity by Design: Fairness-Driven Recommendation in Heterogeneous Two-Sided Markets 

**Authors**: Dominykas Seputis, Rajeev Verma, Alexander Timans  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10739)  

**Abstract**: Two-sided marketplaces embody heterogeneity in incentives: producers seek exposure while consumers seek relevance, and balancing these competing objectives through constrained optimization is now a standard practice. Yet real platforms face finer-grained complexity: consumers differ in preferences and engagement patterns, producers vary in catalog value and capacity, and business objectives impose additional constraints beyond raw relevance. We formalize two-sided fairness under these realistic conditions, extending prior work from soft single-item allocations to discrete multi-item recommendations. We introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a consumer-side objective that compresses group-level utility disparities, and integrate business constraints directly into the optimization. Our experiments reveal that the "free fairness" regime, where producer constraints impose no consumer cost, disappears in multi item settings. Strikingly, moderate fairness constraints can improve business metrics by diversifying exposure away from saturated producers. Scalable solvers match exact solutions at a fraction of the runtime, making fairness-aware allocation practical at scale. These findings reframe fairness not as a tax on platform efficiency but as a lever for sustainable marketplace health.

# Chamfer-Linkage for Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering 

**Authors**: Kishen N Gowda, Willem Fletcher, MohammadHossein Bateni, Laxman Dhulipala, D Ellis Hershkowitz, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub Łącki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10444)  

**Abstract**: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) is a widely-used clustering method based on repeatedly merging the closest pair of clusters, where inter-cluster distances are determined by a linkage function. Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.
In this paper, we propose \emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets. Our results establish Chamfer-linkage as a practical drop-in replacement for classical linkage functions, broadening the toolkit for hierarchical clustering in both theory and practice.

# ECHO: An Open Research Platform for Evaluation of Chat, Human Behavior, and Outcomes 

**Authors**: Jiqun Liu, Nischal Dinesh, Ran Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10295)  

**Abstract**: ECHO (Evaluation of Chat, Human behavior, and Outcomes) is an open research platform designed to support reproducible, mixed-method studies of human interaction with both conversational AI systems and Web search engines. It enables researchers from varying disciplines to orchestrate end-to-end experimental workflows that integrate consent and background surveys, chat-based and search-based information-seeking sessions, writing or judgment tasks, and pre- and post-task evaluations within a unified, low-coding-load framework. ECHO logs fine-grained interaction traces and participant responses, and exports structured datasets for downstream analysis. By supporting both chat and search alongside flexible evaluation instruments, ECHO lowers technical barriers for studying learning, decision making, and user experience across different information access paradigms, empowering researchers from information retrieval, HCI, and the social sciences to conduct scalable and reproducible human-centered AI evaluations.

# Silence Routing: When Not Speaking Improves Collective Judgment 

**Authors**: Itsuki Fujisaki, Kunhao Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.10145)  

**Abstract**: The wisdom of crowds has been shown to operate not only for factual judgments but also in matters of taste, where accuracy is defined relative to an individual's preferences. However, it remains unclear how different types of social signals should be selectively used in such domains. Focusing on a music preference dataset in which contributors provide both personal evaluations (Own) and estimates of population-level preferences (Estimated), we propose a routing framework for collective intelligence in taste. The framework specifies when contributors should speak, what they should report, and when silence is preferable. Using simulation-based aggregation, we show that prediction accuracy improves over an all-own baseline across a broad region of the parameter space, conditional on items where routing applies. Importantly, these gains arise only when silence is allowed, enabling second-order signals to function effectively. The results demonstrate that collective intelligence in matters of taste depends on principled signal routing rather than simple averaging.
