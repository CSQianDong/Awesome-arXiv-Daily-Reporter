In this paper, we introduce a novel social simulator called YuLan-OneSim. Compared to previous works, YuLan-OneSim distinguishes itself in five key aspects: (1) Code-free scenario construction: Users can simply describe and refine their simulation scenarios through natural language interactions with our simulator. All simulation code is automatically generated, significantly reducing the need for programming expertise. (2) Comprehensive default scenarios: We implement 50 default simulation scenarios spanning 8 domains, including economics, sociology, politics, psychology, organization, demographics, law, and communication, broadening access for a diverse range of social researchers. (3) Evolvable simulation: Our simulator is capable of receiving external feedback and automatically fine-tuning the backbone LLMs, significantly enhancing the simulation quality. (4) Large-scale simulation: By developing a fully responsive agent framework and a distributed simulation architecture, our simulator can handle up to 100,000 agents, ensuring more stable and reliable simulation results. (5) AI social researcher: Leveraging the above features, we develop an AI social researcher. Users only need to propose a research topic, and the AI researcher will automatically analyze the input, construct simulation environments, summarize results, generate technical reports, review and refine the reports--completing the social science research loop. To demonstrate the advantages of YuLan-OneSim, we conduct experiments to evaluate the quality of the automatically generated scenarios, the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of the simulation process, as well as the performance of the AI social researcher.'}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks.

Prior analyses devise evaluation strategies that poorly reflect an LLM's realistic performance on tabular queries. Moreover, we have a limited understanding of the robustness of LLMs towards realistic variations in tabular inputs. Therefore, we ask: Can general-purpose LLMs reason over tabular data, really?, and focus on two questions 1) are tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs robust to real-world characteristics of tabular inputs, and 2) how can we realistically evaluate an LLM's performance on analytical tabular queries? Building on a recent tabular reasoning benchmark, we first surface shortcomings of its multiple-choice prompt evaluation strategy, as well as commonly used free-form text metrics such as SacreBleu and BERT-score. We show that an LLM-as-a-judge procedure yields more reliable performance insights and unveil a significant deficit in tabular reasoning performance of LLMs. We then extend the tabular inputs reflecting three common characteristics in practice: 1) missing values, 2) duplicate entities, and 3) structural variations. Experiments show that the tabular reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs suffer from these variations, stressing the importance of improving their robustness for realistic tabular inputs."}

In addition, the penetration testing (PT) process, with its trial-and-error nature, is limited by existing frameworks that lack mechanisms to learn from previous failed operations, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester, which is an AutoPT framework designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactic and technique for the stage, choosing suggested action, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively. The evaluation shows that RefPentester can successfully reveal credentials on Hack The Box's Sau machine, outperforming the baseline GPT-4o model by 16.7\\%.

Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have led to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and science benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on monologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and coherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary shifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning patterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first introduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a single prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis shows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by both quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the analysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason, structured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with rule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt dialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA datasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue models under more complex compound questions. Additionally, we discuss how dialogue-based reasoning helps enhance interpretability, facilitate more intuitive human interaction, and inspire advances in multi-agent system design.'}

Hence, it necessitates challenging evaluation benchmarks that can measure LLM performance in knowledge- and reasoning-based tasks, which is lacking. As a foundational step, we empirically measure the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in CBE. We construct and share an expert-curated dataset of 5,920 examples for benchmarking LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the niche domain of Ionic Liquids (ILs) for carbon sequestration, an emergent solution to reducing global warming. The dataset presents different difficulty levels by varying along the dimensions of linguistic and domain-specific knowledge. Benchmarking three less than 10B parameter open-source LLMs on the dataset suggests that while smaller general-purpose LLMs are knowledgeable about ILs, they lack domain-specific reasoning capabilities. Based on our results, we further discuss considerations for leveraging LLMs for carbon capture research using ILs. Since LLMs have a high carbon footprint, gearing them for IL research can symbiotically benefit both fields and help reach the ambitious carbon neutrality target by 2050.

However, their large-scale nature, sensitivity to privacy concerns, and substantial computational demands present significant challenges to personalized customization for end users. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the vision of artificial personalized intelligence (API), focusing on adapting these powerful models to meet the specific needs and preferences of users while maintaining privacy and efficiency. Specifically, this paper proposes personalized federated intelligence (PFI), which integrates the privacy-preserving advantages of federated learning (FL) with the zero-shot generalization capabilities of FMs, enabling personalized, efficient, and privacy-protective deployment at the edge. We first review recent advances in both FL and FMs, and discuss the potential of leveraging FMs to enhance federated systems. We then present the key motivations behind realizing PFI and explore promising opportunities in this space, including efficient PFI, trustworthy PFI, and PFI empowered by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Finally, we outline key challenges and future research directions for deploying FM-powered FL systems at the edge with improved personalization, computational efficiency, and privacy guarantees.

Benchmark saturation weakens their guiding role for LLMs. For example, HumanEval Pass@1 has reached 99.4% and MBPP 94.2%. Among various attempts to address benchmark saturation, approaches based on software engineering have stood out, but the saturation of existing software engineering benchmarks is rapidly increasing. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, Web-Bench, which contains 50 projects, each consisting of 20 tasks with sequential dependencies. The tasks implement project features in sequence, simulating real-world human development workflows. When designing Web-Bench, we aim to cover the foundational elements of Web development: Web Standards and Web Frameworks. Given the scale and complexity of these projects, which were designed by engineers with 5 to 10 years of experience, each presents a significant challenge. On average, a single project takes 4 to 8 hours for a senior engineer to complete. On our given benchmark agent (Web-Agent), SOTA (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) achieves only 25.1% Pass@1, significantly lower (better) than SWE-Bench's Verified (65.4%) and Full (33.8%) scores.

In this work, we propose KCluster, a novel KC discovery algorithm based on identifying clusters of congruent questions according to a new similarity metric induced by a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate in three datasets that an LLM can create an effective metric of question similarity, which a clustering algorithm can use to create KC models from questions with minimal human effort. Combining the strengths of LLM and clustering, KCluster generates descriptive KC labels and discovers KC models that predict student performance better than the best expert-designed models available. In anticipation of future work, we illustrate how KCluster can reveal insights into difficult KCs and suggest improvements to instruction.'}

However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US.

We have observed that the CPT loss curve fundamentally characterizes the transition from one curve to another hidden curve, and could be described by decoupling the effects of distribution shift and learning rate annealing. We derive a CPT scaling law that combines the two factors, enabling the prediction of loss at any (continual) training steps and across learning rate schedules (LRS) in CPT. Our formulation presents a comprehensive understanding of several critical factors in CPT, including loss potential, peak learning rate, training steps, replay ratio, etc. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to customize training hyper-parameters to different CPT goals such as balancing general and domain-specific performance.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) open up the possibility of generative CAD, where natural language is directly translated into parametric 3D models. However, most existing methods generate task-specific command sequences that pretrained models cannot directly handle. These sequences must be converted into CAD representations such as CAD vectors before a 3D model can be produced, which requires training models from scratch and adds unnecessary complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose generating CadQuery code directly from text, leveraging the strengths of pretrained LLMs to produce 3D models without intermediate representations, using this Python-based scripting language. Since LLMs already excel at Python generation and spatial reasoning, fine-tuning them on Text-to-CadQuery data proves highly effective. Given that these capabilities typically improve with scale, we hypothesize that larger models will perform better after fine-tuning. To enable this, we augment the Text2CAD dataset with 170,000 CadQuery annotations. We fine-tune six open-source LLMs of varying sizes and observe consistent improvements.

Inspired by the mutual grounding theory in communication, we propose an interactive approach that leverages code comments as a medium for developers and LLMs to establish a shared understanding. Our approach facilitates iterative grounding by interleaving code generation, inline comment generation, and contextualized user feedback through editable comments to align generated code with developer intent. We evaluated our approach on two popular benchmarks and demonstrated that our approach significantly improved multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., 17.1% pass@1 improvement for code-davinci-002 on HumanEval. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with 12 participants in comparison to two baselines: (1) interacting with GitHub Copilot, and (2) interacting with a multi-step code generation paradigm called Multi-Turn Program Synthesis.

An approach to steer LLM behavior, such as mitigating biases or defending against jailbreaks, is to identify which parts of a prompt influence specific aspects of the model's output. Token-level attribution methods offer a promising solution, but still struggle in text generation, explaining the presence of each token in the output separately, rather than the underlying semantics of the entire LLM response. We introduce ConceptX, a model-agnostic, concept-level explainability method that identifies the concepts, i.e., semantically rich tokens in the prompt, and assigns them importance based on the outputs' semantic similarity. Unlike current token-level methods, ConceptX also offers to preserve context integrity through in-place token replacements and supports flexible explanation goals, e.g., gender bias. ConceptX enables both auditing, by uncovering sources of bias, and steering, by modifying prompts to shift the sentiment or reduce the harmfulness of LLM responses, without requiring retraining. Across three LLMs, ConceptX outperforms token-level methods like TokenSHAP in both faithfulness and human alignment.

Furtado', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07601', 'abstract': "Detective fiction, a genre defined by its complex narrative structures and character-driven storytelling, presents unique challenges for computational narratology, a research field focused on integrating literary theory into automated narrative generation. While traditional literary studies have offered deep insights into the methods and archetypes of fictional detectives, these analyses often focus on a limited number of characters and lack the scalability needed for the extraction of unique traits that can be used to guide narrative generation methods. In this paper, we present an AI-driven approach for systematically characterizing the investigative methods of fictional detectives. Our multi-phase workflow explores the capabilities of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract, synthesize, and validate distinctive investigative traits of fictional detectives. This approach was tested on a diverse set of seven iconic detectives - Hercule Poirot, Sherlock Holmes, William Murdoch, Columbo, Father Brown, Miss Marple, and Auguste Dupin - capturing the distinctive investigative styles that define each character. The identified traits were validated against existing literary analyses and further tested in a reverse identification phase, achieving an overall accuracy of 91.43%, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in capturing the distinctive investigative approaches of each detective. This work contributes to the broader field of computational narratology by providing a scalable framework for character analysis, with potential applications in AI-driven interactive storytelling and automated narrative generation."}

Building on this framework, we develop an automated instruction generation pipeline that performs constraint expansion, conflict detection, and instruction rewriting, yielding 1,200 code-verifiable instruction-following test samples. We evaluate 19 LLMs across seven model families and uncover substantial variation in performance across constraint forms. For instance, average performance drops from 77.67% at Level I to 32.96% at Level IV. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of our approach by using it to generate data for reinforcement learning, achieving substantial gains in instruction following without degrading general performance. In-depth analysis indicates that these gains stem primarily from modifications in the model's attention modules parameters, which enhance constraint recognition and adherence.

In this paper, we propose LEAD, an efficient iterative data selection framework that accurately estimates sample utility entirely within the standard training loop, eliminating the need for costly additional model inference. At its core, LEAD introduces Instance-Level Dynamic Uncertainty (IDU), a theoretically grounded utility function combining instantaneous training loss, gradient-based approximation of loss changes, and exponential smoothing of historical loss signals. To further scale efficiently to large datasets, LEAD employs a two-stage, coarse-to-fine selection strategy, adaptively prioritizing informative clusters through a multi-armed bandit mechanism, followed by precise fine-grained selection of high-utility samples using IDU. Extensive experiments across four diverse benchmarks show that LEAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving average model performance by 6.1%-10.8% while using only 2.5% of the training data and reducing overall training time by 5-10x.'}

We compare LLM behavior to market dynamics observed in laboratory settings and assess their alignment with human participants' behavior. Our findings indicate that LLMs do not adhere strictly to rational expectations, displaying instead bounded rationality, similarly to human participants. Providing a minimal context window i.e. memory of three previous time steps, combined with a high variability setting capturing response heterogeneity, allows LLMs to replicate broad trends seen in human experiments, such as the distinction between positive and negative feedback markets. However, differences remain at a granular level--LLMs exhibit less heterogeneity in behavior than humans. These results suggest that LLMs hold promise as tools for simulating realistic human behavior in economic contexts, though further research is needed to refine their accuracy and increase behavioral diversity."}

Current APR systems are constrained by the limited availability of high-quality training data encompassing diverse bug types across multiple programming languages. The proposed approach addresses this limitation through a two-phase process: a synthetic sample generation followed by a rigorous quality assessment. Multiple state-of-the-art LLMs were employed to generate approximately 30,000 paired examples of buggy and fixed code across 12 programming languages and 13 bug categories. Subsequently, these samples underwent cross-model evaluation against five criteria: correctness, code quality, security, performance, and completeness. Experimental evaluation on the VulRepair test set dataset showed statistically significant improvements in Perfect Prediction rates, with the quality-filtered synthetic dataset outperforming both baseline and real-world commit data configurations in certain scenarios. The methodology was validated through rigorous statistical testing, including ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's Honest Significant Difference analysis. Furthermore, the best-performing configurations surpassed existing systems despite using a less computationally intensive decoding strategy.

To address these limitations, an efficient and adaptive search agent capable of discerning optimal retrieval timing and synergistically integrating parametric (internal) and retrieved (external) knowledge is in urgent need. This paper introduces the Reinforced Internal-External Knowledge Synergistic Reasoning Agent (IKEA), which could indentify its own knowledge boundary and prioritize the utilization of internal knowledge, resorting to external search only when internal knowledge is deemed insufficient. This is achieved using a novel knowledge-boundary aware reward function and a knowledge-boundary aware training dataset. These are designed for internal-external knowledge synergy oriented RL, incentivizing the model to deliver accurate answers, minimize unnecessary retrievals, and encourage appropriate external searches when its own knowledge is lacking. Evaluations across multiple knowledge reasoning tasks demonstrate that IKEA significantly outperforms baseline methods, reduces retrieval frequency significantly, and exhibits robust generalization capabilities.'}

This system employs an accurate and fast predictor to predict the sparsity distribution of activation function output. Additionally, we introduce a new private inference protocol. It efficiently and securely avoids computations involving zero values by exploiting the spatial locality of the predicted sparse distribution. While this computation-avoidance approach impacts the spatiotemporal continuity of KV cache entries, we address this challenge with a low-communication overhead cache refilling strategy that merges miss requests and incorporates a prefetching mechanism.

Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT).

To achieve this goal, the OPUS system improves cost-effectiveness by generating keywords from a high-level camera control API and transferring knowledge from larger closed-source language models to smaller ones through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on synthetic data. This enables efficient edge deployment while maintaining performance comparable to larger models like GPT-4. OPUS enhances environmental awareness by converting data from multiple cameras into textual descriptions for language models, eliminating the need for specialized sensory tokens. In benchmark testing, our approach significantly outperformed both traditional language model techniques and more complex prompting methods, achieving a 35% improvement over advanced techniques and a 20% higher task accuracy compared to closed-source models like Gemini Pro. The system demonstrates OPUS's capability to simplify PTZ camera operations through an intuitive natural language interface.

However, since LLMs can produce inaccurate or imprecise responses, it is crucial to assess the reliability of these citations.\nTo tackle this, our work proposes two techniques.

Our method using flan-ul2 demonstrates an improvement of 0.27% and 2.4% over the best baseline of ID and OOD sets of AttributionBench, respectively.

KDH-MLTC transfers knowledge from a more complex teacher LLM (i.e., BERT) to a lighter student LLM (i.e., DistilBERT) through sequential training adapted to MLTC that preserves the teacher's learned information while significantly reducing computational requirements. As a result, the classification is enabled to be conducted locally, making it suitable for healthcare textual data characterized by sensitivity and, therefore, ensuring HIPAA compliance. The experiments conducted on three medical literature datasets of different sizes, sampled from the Hallmark of Cancer (HoC) dataset, demonstrate that KDH-MLTC achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches, particularly for the largest dataset, reaching an F1 score of 82.70%. Additionally, statistical validation and an ablation study are carried out, proving the robustness of KDH-MLTC. Furthermore, the PSO-based hyperparameter optimization process allowed the identification of optimal configurations. The proposed approach contributes to healthcare text classification research, balancing efficiency requirements in resource-constrained healthcare settings with satisfactory accuracy demands."}

Lam', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07157', 'abstract': 'Traditional topic models often struggle with contextual nuances and fail to adequately handle polysemy and rare words. This limitation typically results in topics that lack coherence and quality. Large Language Models (LLMs) can mitigate this issue by generating an initial set of topics. However, these raw topics frequently lack refinement and representativeness, which leads to redundancy without lexical similarity and reduced interpretability. This paper introduces HAMLET, a graph-driven architecture for cross-lingual healthcare topic modeling that uses LLMs. The proposed approach leverages neural-enhanced semantic fusion to refine the embeddings of topics generated by the LLM. Instead of relying solely on statistical co-occurrence or human interpretation to extract topics from a document corpus, this method introduces a topic embedding refinement that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). After topic generation, a hybrid technique that involves BERT and Sentence-BERT (SBERT) is employed for embedding. The topic representations are further refined using a GNN, which establishes connections between documents, topics, words, similar topics, and similar words. A novel method is introduced to compute similarities. Consequently, the topic embeddings are refined, and the top k topics are extracted. Experiments were conducted using two healthcare datasets, one in English and one in French, from which six sets were derived. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of HAMLET.'}

Existing research has primarily focused on approximating human-based model rankings using limited data and LLM-as-a-Judge. However, the fundamental premise of these studies, which attempts to replicate human rankings, is flawed. Specifically, these benchmarks typically offer only overall scores, limiting their utility to leaderboard rankings, rather than providing feedback that can guide model optimization and support model profiling. Therefore, we advocate for an evaluation paradigm shift from approximating human-based model rankings to providing feedback with analytical value. To this end, we introduce Feedbacker, an evaluation framework that provides comprehensive and fine-grained results, thereby enabling thorough identification of a model's specific strengths and weaknesses. Such feedback not only supports the targeted optimization of the model but also enhances the understanding of its behavior. Feedbacker comprises three key components: an extensible tree-based query taxonomy builder, an automated query synthesis scheme, and a suite of visualization and analysis tools. Furthermore, we propose a novel LLM-as-a-Judge method: PC2 (Pre-Comparison-derived Criteria) pointwise evaluation. This method derives evaluation criteria by pre-comparing the differences between several auxiliary responses, achieving the accuracy of pairwise evaluation while maintaining the time complexity of pointwise evaluation. Finally, leveraging the evaluation results of 17 mainstream LLMs, we demonstrate the usage of Feedbacker and highlight its effectiveness and potential.

This task presents significant challenges due to inherent linguistic features such as diverse phrasing, semantic complexity, and contextual nuances. While Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) built upon the Transformer architecture have yielded substantial advancements in NLI, prevailing methods predominantly utilize representations from the terminal layer. This reliance on final-layer outputs may overlook valuable information encoded in intermediate layers, potentially limiting the capacity to model intricate semantic interactions effectively. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Cascaded Interactive Reasoning Network (CIRN), a novel architecture designed for deeper semantic comprehension in NLI. CIRN implements a hierarchical feature extraction strategy across multiple network depths, operating within an interactive space where cross-sentence information is continuously integrated. This mechanism aims to mimic a process of progressive reasoning, transitioning from surface-level feature matching to uncovering more profound logical and semantic connections between the premise and hypothesis. By systematically mining latent semantic relationships at various representational levels, CIRN facilitates a more thorough understanding of the input pair. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on several standard NLI benchmark datasets reveal consistent performance gains achieved by CIRN over competitive baseline approaches, demonstrating the efficacy of leveraging multi-level interactive features for complex relational reasoning.'}

However, most existing benchmarks focus narrowly on the accuracy of the final answer while ignoring other metrics. In particular, when applying MLLMs to educational contexts, the goal is not only correctness but also the ability to teach. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates MLLMs as science tutors using a comprehensive educational rubric and a simulated student model that judges the teaching performance of the tutors. Given a list of candidate MLLM science tutors, we use rubric-based student judgments to produce a range of tutor performance scores, identifying both strong and weak tutors. Using the training section of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise comparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to apply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming tutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that strong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that performance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally aligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve not only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.'}

Our methodology combines two key components: Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques and a specialized sequence-to-sequence machine transliteration architecture. We developed and implemented a systematic approach for constructing a comprehensive lexical database for homographs with multiple pronunciations disambiguation often termed polyphones, utilizing formal concept analysis for semantic differentiation. We train our model using two distinct datasets: the LLM-generated dataset for formal and informal Persian and the B-Plus podcasts for informal language variants. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in handling the complexities of Persian phoneme conversion. Our model significantly improves Phoneme Error Rate (PER) metrics, establishing a new benchmark for Persian G2P conversion accuracy.

This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLMs."}

However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which manipulate the models into generating harmful responses despite safety alignment. Recent studies have shown that current safety-aligned LLMs often undergo the shallow safety alignment, where the first few tokens largely determine whether the response will be harmful. Through comprehensive observations, we find that safety-aligned LLMs and various defense strategies generate highly similar initial tokens in their refusal responses, which we define as safety trigger tokens. Building on this insight, we propose \\texttt{D-STT}, a simple yet effective defense algorithm that identifies and explicitly decodes safety trigger tokens of the given safety-aligned LLM to trigger the model's learned safety patterns. In this process, the safety trigger is constrained to a single token, which effectively preserves model usability by introducing minimum intervention in the decoding process. Extensive experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks and benign prompts demonstrate that \\ours significantly reduces output harmfulness while preserving model usability and incurring negligible response time overhead, outperforming ten baseline methods."}

Recent research has questioned the role of fine-tuning vs. that of pre-training within dense retrievers, specifically arguing that retrieval knowledge is primarily gained during pre-training, meaning knowledge not acquired during pre-training cannot be sub-sequentially acquired via fine-tuning. We revisit this idea here as the claim was only studied in the context of a BERT-based encoder using DPR as representative dense retriever. We extend the previous analysis by testing other representation approaches (comparing the use of CLS tokens with that of mean pooling), backbone architectures (encoder-only BERT vs. decoder-only LLaMA), and additional datasets (MSMARCO in addition to Natural Questions). Our study confirms that in DPR tuning, pre-trained knowledge underpins retrieval performance, with fine-tuning primarily adjusting neuron activation rather than reorganizing knowledge. However, this pattern does not hold universally, such as in mean-pooled (Contriever) and decoder-based (LLaMA) models.

A critical step in this process is the development of complex Boolean queries to retrieve relevant literature. Given the difficulty of manually constructing these queries, recent efforts have explored Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in their formulation. One of the first studies,Wang et al., investigated ChatGPT for this task, followed by Staudinger et al., which evaluated multiple LLMs in a reproducibility study. However, the latter overlooked several key aspects of the original work, including (i) validation of generated queries, (ii) output formatting constraints, and (iii) selection of examples for chain-of-thought (Guided) prompting. As a result, its findings diverged significantly from the original study. In this work, we systematically reproduce both studies while addressing these overlooked factors. Our results show that query effectiveness varies significantly across models and prompt designs, with guided query formulation benefiting from well-chosen seed studies. Overall, prompt design and model selection are key drivers of successful query formulation. Our findings provide a clearer understanding of LLMs' potential in Boolean query generation and highlight the importance of model- and prompt-specific optimisations. The complex nature of systematic reviews adds to challenges in both developing and reproducing methods but also highlights the importance of reproducibility studies in this domain."}

In this paper, to investigate differences in how the two jurisdictions manage and present evidence, we developed and evaluated a Large Language Model-based sentence classifier to perform automated analyses of electronic cigarette-related policy documents drawn from official Australian and UK legislative processes (109 documents in total). Specifically, we utilized GPT-4 to automatically classify sentences based on whether they contained claims that e-cigarettes were broadly helpful or harmful for public health. Our LLM-based classifier achieved an F-score of 0.9. Further, when applying the classifier to our entire sentence-level corpus, we found that Australian legislative documents show a much higher proportion of harmful statements, and a lower proportion of helpful statements compared to the expected values, with the opposite holding for the UK. In conclusion, this work utilized an LLM-based approach to provide evidence to support the contention that - drawing on the same evidence base - Australian ENDS-related policy documents emphasize the harms associated with ENDS products and UK policy documents emphasize the benefits.

This trend highlights the increasing importance of effective and lossless compression for such data in modern text management systems. However, compressing LLM-generated data presents unique challenges compared to traditional human- or machine-generated content. Traditional machine-generated data is typically derived from computational processes or device outputs, often highly structured and limited to low-level elements like labels or numerical values. This structure enables conventional lossless compressors to perform efficiently. In contrast, LLM-generated data is more complex and diverse, requiring new approaches for effective compression. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of lossless compression techniques tailored specifically to LLM-generated data. Notably, because LLMs are trained via next-token prediction, we find that LLM-generated data is highly predictable for the models themselves. This predictability enables LLMs to serve as efficient compressors of their own outputs. Through extensive experiments with 14 representative LLMs and 8 LLM-generated datasets from diverse domains, we show that LLM-based prediction methods achieve remarkable compression rates, exceeding 20x, far surpassing the 3x rate achieved by Gzip, a widely used general-purpose compressor. Furthermore, this advantage holds across different LLM sizes and dataset types, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of LLM-based methods in lossless text compression under generative AI workloads.'}

We uncover a performance gap between Qwen2-Audio and Qwen2-VL that parallels the sensory discrepancy between human ears and eyes. To reduce this gap, we introduce a cross-modal distillation framework, where an LLM in one modality serves as the teacher and another as the student, with knowledge transfer in sound classes predicted as more challenging to the student by a heuristic model. Distillation in both directions, from Qwen2-VL to Qwen2-Audio and vice versa, leads to notable improvements, particularly in challenging classes.

To leverage the ranking power of LLMs while meeting the low-latency demands of production systems, we propose a novel framework that distills a high performing LLM into a more efficient, low-latency student model. To help the student model learn more effectively from the teacher model, we first train the teacher LLM as a classification model with soft targets. Then, we train the student model to capture the relevance margin between pairs of products for a given query using mean squared error loss. Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we significantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and labeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that the student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented training data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model can outperform the teacher model.
