Yang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21803', 'abstract': "Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools."}

However, standard gradient guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process: (1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.

Assaad', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21742', 'abstract': 'Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified, experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series data.'}

This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.\nOn a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$ cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling probability of $100\\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\\%$ for 6 city cases.

Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision.

It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA* concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion.

These generalized landmarks are learned from a set of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain. If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the same domain.'}

To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers.

Similar proposals have been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an \\ltlf formula $\\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that comply with $\\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that must satisfy $\\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct practical algorithms in this area.'}

Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity, requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score (restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study, participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct, operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe, middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.'}

Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states, and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+, where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+ state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH, constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or ``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains."}

Forgetting has many facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating forgetting operations.

This discrepancy highlights a critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods.

By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines.

We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.'}

Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.'}

Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions, underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by 70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings, rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding existing benchmarks."}

Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images.

To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns.

Videos represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks.

In this paper, we propose OptMark, an optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods, reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1).

Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware architectures in mission-critical energy systems."}

However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.'}

Operationalizing this principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data, remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets, choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity' difficult to implement."}

We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.'}

However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.'}

However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio."}

In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory, performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.'}

However, their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge, especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level, each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from different application domains and with varying numbers of classes.

Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a 7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.\nTo address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets.

This method transforms the network data into a model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method. Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile communication networks as well as transportation networks."}

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.'}

The algorithm injects heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning rate choices.'}

Second, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator can capture the temporal features from real time series.

However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.'}

It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs.\nWe present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.'}

Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory, G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data ("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework\'s effectiveness and domain-generality.'}

While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees.

However, existing methods are often tailored to a particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful unlearning performance.'}

Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings.

However, degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM (Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for future development.'}

The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection.

In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests.

To address this limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods.

Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation.

We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches."}

We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.'}
