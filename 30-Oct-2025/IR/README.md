**Authors**: Jamie Mahowald, Benjamin Charles Germain Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25718)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal approaches have shown great promise for searching and navigating digital collections held by libraries, archives, and museums. In this paper, we introduce map-RAS: a retrieval-augmented search system for historic maps. In addition to introducing our framework, we detail our publicly-hosted demo for searching 101,233 map images held by the Library of Congress. With our system, users can multimodally query the map collection via ColPali, summarize search results using Llama 3.2, and upload their own collections to perform inter-collection search. We articulate potential use cases for archivists, curators, and end-users, as well as future work with our system in both machine learning and the digital humanities.

# MMQ-v2: Align, Denoise, and Amplify: Adaptive Behavior Mining for Semantic IDs Learning in Recommendation 

**Authors**: Yi Xu, Moyu Zhang, Chaofan Fan, Jinxin Hu, Xiaochen Li, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyi Zeng, Jing Zhang

**Abstract**: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs). However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large, dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail this http URL-based Semantic IDs (SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However, by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse, creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align, Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.

# Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback 

**Authors**: Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Fen Lin, Qin Liu, Qingyao Ai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25488)  

**Abstract**: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again, relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents, not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

# Towards Automated Quality Assurance of Patent Specifications: A Multi-Dimensional LLM Framework 

**Authors**: Yuqian Chai, Chaochao Wang, Weilei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25402)  

**Abstract**: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools, systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module. The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80 human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools. Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\% respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

# Revisiting scalable sequential recommendation with Multi-Embedding Approach and Mixture-of-Experts 

**Authors**: Qiushi Pan, Hao Wang, Guoyuan An, Luankang Zhang, Wei Guo, Yong Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25285)  

**Abstract**: In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items' multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context. To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations. Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework outperforms several competitive baselines.

# TV-Rec: Time-Variant Convolutional Filter for Sequential Recommendation 

**Authors**: Yehjin Shin, Jeongwhan Choi, Seojin Kim, Noseong Park  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25259)  

**Abstract**: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However, most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

# GReF: A Unified Generative Framework for Efficient Reranking via Ordered Multi-token Prediction 

**Authors**: Zhijie Lin, Zhuofeng Li, Chenglei Dai, Wentian Bao, Shuai Lin, Enyun Yu, Haoxiang Zhang, Liang Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25220)  

**Abstract**: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model. However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second, autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP), which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

# FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering 

**Authors**: Mohammad Aghajani Asl, Behrooz Minaei Bidgoli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25621)  

**Abstract**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

# Model-Document Protocol for AI Search 

**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25160)  

**Abstract**: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.
We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.
As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

# Continual Low-Rank Adapters for LLM-based Generative Recommender Systems 

**Authors**: Hyunsik Yoo, Ting-Wei Li, SeongKu Kang, Zhining Liu, Charlie Xu, Qilin Qi, Hanghang Tong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25093)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors. Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

# Secure Retrieval-Augmented Generation against Poisoning Attacks 

**Authors**: Zirui Cheng, Jikai Sun, Anjun Gao, Yueyang Quan, Zhuqing Liu, Xiaohua Hu, Minghong Fang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25025)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing (NLP), enabling applications from content generation to decision support. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves LLMs by incorporating external knowledge but also introduces security risks, particularly from data poisoning, where the attacker injects poisoned texts into the knowledge database to manipulate system outputs. While various defenses have been proposed, they often struggle against advanced attacks. To address this, we introduce RAGuard, a detection framework designed to identify poisoned texts. RAGuard first expands the retrieval scope to increase the proportion of clean texts, reducing the likelihood of retrieving poisoned content. It then applies chunk-wise perplexity filtering to detect abnormal variations and text similarity filtering to flag highly similar texts. This non-parametric approach enhances RAG security, and experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating poisoning attacks, including strong adaptive attacks.

# Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Alexander Martin, William Walden, Reno Kriz, Dengjia Zhang, Kate Sanders, Eugene Yang, Chihsheng Jin, Benjamin Van Durme  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24870)  

**Abstract**: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess multimodal RAG.

# ODataX: A Progressive Evolution of the Open Data Protocol 

**Authors**: Anirudh Ganesh, Nitin Sood  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24761)  

**Abstract**: The Open Data Protocol (OData) provides a standardized approach for building and consuming RESTful APIs with rich query capabilities. Despite its power and maturity, OData adoption remains confined primarily to enterprise environments, particularly within Microsoft and SAP ecosystems. This paper analyzes the key barriers preventing wider OData adoption and introduces ODataX, an evolved version of the protocol designed to address these limitations. ODataX maintains backward compatibility with OData v4 while introducing progressive complexity disclosure through simplified query syntax, built-in performance guardrails via query cost estimation, and enhanced caching mechanisms. This work aims to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade query standardization and the simplicity demanded by modern web development practices.

# Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries 

**Authors**: Shravan Gadbail, Masumi Desai, Kamalakar Karlapalem  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24719)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.
