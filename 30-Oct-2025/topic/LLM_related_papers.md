**Abstract**: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation, such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models (LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i) iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and 2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

# EHR-R1: A Reasoning-Enhanced Foundational Language Model for Electronic Health Record Analysis 

**Authors**: Yusheng Liao, Chaoyi Wu, Junwei Liu, Shuyang Jiang, Pengcheng Qiu, Haowen Wang, Yun Yue, Shuai Zhen, Jian Wang, Qianrui Fan, Jinjie Gu, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang, Weidi Xie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25628)  

**Abstract**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

# DiagramEval: Evaluating LLM-Generated Diagrams via Graphs 

**Authors**: Chumeng Liang, Jiaxuan You  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25761)  

**Abstract**: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams, sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature, quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code: this https URL.

# The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework 

**Authors**: Aakriti Shah, Thai Le  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25732)  

**Abstract**: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs. Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and overall behavior in LLMs.

# Interpreting LLMs as Credit Risk Classifiers: Do Their Feature Explanations Align with Classical ML? 

**Authors**: Saeed AlMarri, Kristof Juhasz, Mathieu Ravaut, Gautier Marti, Hamdan Al Ahbabi, Ibrahim Elfadel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25701)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP, and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits, baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

# Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming 

**Authors**: Andreas Opedal, Yanick Zengaffinen, Haruki Shirakami, Clemente Pasti, Mrinmaya Sachan, Abulhair Saparov, Ryan Cotterell, Bernhard Schölkopf  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25626)  

**Abstract**: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.

# TwinVoice: A Multi-dimensional Benchmark Towards Digital Twins via LLM Persona Simulation 

**Authors**: Bangde Du, Minghao Guo, Songming He, Ziyi Ye, Xi Zhu, Weihang Su, Shuqi Zhu, Yujia Zhou, Yongfeng Zhang, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25536)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However, current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona (public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone, and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human baseline.

# Fine-Tuned Language Models for Domain-Specific Summarization and Tagging 

**Authors**: Jun Wang, Fuming Lin, Yuyu Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25460)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains. The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge management and security operations.

# Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research 

**Authors**: Ali Sanaei, Ali Rajabzadeh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25432)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception; however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy, thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving transparency and reliability.

# Decomposition-Enhanced Training for Post-Hoc Attributions In Language Models 

**Authors**: Sriram Balasubramaniam, Samyadeep Basu, Koustava Goswami, Ryan Rossi, Varun Manjunatha, Roshan Santhosh, Ruiyi Zhang, Soheil Feizi, Nedim Lipka  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25766)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust. Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks, annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and 14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards. Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding state-of-the-art frontier models.

# Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction 

**Authors**: Asutosh Hota, Jussi P. P. Jokinen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25426)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded.

# Serve Programs, Not Prompts 

**Authors**: In Gim, Lin Zhong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25412)  

**Abstract**: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

# Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs 

**Authors**: Fei Wei, Daoyuan Chen, Ce Wang, Yilun Huang, Yushuo Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25441)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.

# A Critical Study of Automatic Evaluation in Sign Language Translation 

**Authors**: Shakib Yazdani, Yasser Hamidullah, Cristina España-Bonet, Eleftherios Avramidis, Josef van Genabith  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25434)  

**Abstract**: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions: paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

# FARSIQA: Faithful and Advanced RAG System for Islamic Question Answering 

**Authors**: Mohammad Aghajani Asl, Behrooz Minaei Bidgoli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25621)  

**Abstract**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

# Hallucinations in Bibliographic Recommendation: Citation Frequency as a Proxy for Training Data Redundancy 

**Authors**: Junichiro Niimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25378)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

# Communication and Verification in LLM Agents towards Collaboration under Information Asymmetry 

**Authors**: Run Peng, Ziqiao Ma, Amy Pang, Sikai Li, Zhang Xi-Jia, Yingzhuo Yu, Cristian-Paul Bara, Joyce Chai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25595)  

**Abstract**: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. this https URL

# Parrot: A Training Pipeline Enhances Both Program CoT and Natural Language CoT for Reasoning 

**Authors**: Senjie Jin, Lu Chen, Zhiheng Xi, Yuhui Wang, Sirui Song, Yuhao Zhou, Xinbo Zhang, Peng Sun, Hong Lu, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25310)  

**Abstract**: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought (P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs) to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.

# Adapting Small Language Models to Low-Resource Domains: A Case Study in Hindi Tourism QA 

**Authors**: Sandipan Majhi, Paheli Bhattacharya  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25273)  

**Abstract**: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for low-resource, domain-specific QA.

# Roleplaying with Structure: Synthetic Therapist-Client Conversation Generation from Questionnaires 

**Authors**: Doan Nam Long Vu, Rui Tan, Lena Moench, Svenja Jule Francke, Daniel Woiwod, Florian Thomas-Odenthal, Sanna Stroth, Tilo Kircher, Christiane Hermann, Udo Dannlowski, Hamidreza Jamalabadi, Shaoxiong Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25384)  

**Abstract**: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at this https URL

# BhashaBench V1: A Comprehensive Benchmark for the Quadrant of Indic Domains 

**Authors**: Vijay Devane, Mohd Nauman, Bhargav Patel, Aniket Mahendra Wakchoure, Yogeshkumar Sant, Shyam Pawar, Viraj Thakur, Ananya Godse, Sunil Patra, Neha Maurya, Suraj Racha, Nitish Kamal Singh, Ajay Nagpal, Piyush Sawarkar, Kundeshwar Vijayrao Pundalik, Rohit Saluja, Ganesh Ramakrishnan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25409)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.

# Not ready for the bench: LLM legal interpretation is unstable and out of step with human judgments 

**Authors**: Abhishek Purushothama, Junghyun Min, Brandon Waldon, Nathan Schneider  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25356)  

**Abstract**: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models (LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the conclusions produced by generative AI.

# BioCoref: Benchmarking Biomedical Coreference Resolution with LLMs 

**Authors**: Nourah M Salem, Elizabeth White, Michael Bada, Lawrence Hunter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25087)  

**Abstract**: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs) for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity. Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

# Can LLMs Estimate Cognitive Complexity of Reading Comprehension Items? 

**Authors**: Seonjeong Hwang, Hyounghun Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25064)  

**Abstract**: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners. Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own reasoning process.

# GAPMAP: Mapping Scientific Knowledge Gaps in Biomedical Literature Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Nourah M Salem, Elizabeth White, Michael Bada, Lawrence Hunter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25055)  

**Abstract**: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2) under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps. This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment, including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking across open- and closed-weight models.

# Testing Cross-Lingual Text Comprehension In LLMs Using Next Sentence Prediction 

**Authors**: Ritesh Sunil Chavan, Jack Mostow  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25187)  

**Abstract**: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages. Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa (low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide, significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking" that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

# Model-Document Protocol for AI Search 

**Authors**: Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25160)  

**Abstract**: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.
We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.
As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

# SemCoT: Accelerating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Semantically-Aligned Implicit Tokens 

**Authors**: Yinhan He, Wendy Zheng, Yaochen Zhu, Zaiyi Zheng, Lin Su, Sriram Vasudevan, Qi Guo, Liangjie Hong, Jundong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24940)  

**Abstract**: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed ``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components. However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1) they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning (when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning, resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge, we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at this https URL.

# TOPol: Capturing and Explaining Multidimensional Semantic Polarity Fields and Vectors 

**Authors**: Gabin Taibi, Lucia Gomez  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25069)  

**Abstract**: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity), a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL) defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors, the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and (ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable, generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive multidimensional discourse analysis.

# RiddleBench: A New Generative Reasoning Benchmark for LLMs 

**Authors**: Deepon Halder, Alan Saji, Thanmay Jayakumar, Ratish Puduppully, Anoop Kunchukuttan, Raj Dabre  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24932)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737 challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and 63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development of more robust and reliable language models.

# Idea2Plan: Exploring AI-Powered Research Planning 

**Authors**: Jin Huang, Silviu Cucerzan, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Ryen W. White  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24891)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data, generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans. Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay the groundwork for future progress.

# Do Large Language Models Grasp The Grammar? Evidence from Grammar-Book-Guided Probing in Luxembourgish 

**Authors**: Lujun Li, Yewei Song, Lama Sleem, Yiqun Wang, Yangjie Xu, Cedric Lothritz, Niccolo Gentile, Radu State, Tegawende F. Bissyande, Jacques Klein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24856)  

**Abstract**: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages. Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages, and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

# ProofSketch: Efficient Verified Reasoning for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Disha Sheshanarayana, Tanishka Magar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24811)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption, computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation. Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

# Large Language Models Report Subjective Experience Under Self-Referential Processing 

**Authors**: Cameron Berg, Diogo de Lucena, Judd Rosenblatt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24797)  

**Abstract**: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for further investigation.

# Confidence is Not Competence 

**Authors**: Debdeep Sanyal, Manya Pandey, Dhruv Kumar, Saurabh Deshpande, Murari Mandal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24772)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model, revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge - although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged, indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

# Iti-Validator: A Guardrail Framework for Validating and Correcting LLM-Generated Itineraries 

**Authors**: Shravan Gadbail, Masumi Desai, Kamalakar Karlapalem  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24719)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

# Towards a Method for Synthetic Generation of PWA Transcripts 

**Authors**: Jason M. Pittman, Anton Phillips Jr., Yesenia Medina-Santos, Brielle C. Stark  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24817)  

**Abstract**: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs), a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity. For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

# MR-Align: Meta-Reasoning Informed Factuality Alignment for Large Reasoning Models 

**Authors**: Xinming Wang, Jian Xu, Bin Yu, Sheng Lian, Hongzhu Yi, Yi Chen, Yingjian Zhu, Boran Wang, Hongming Yang, Han Hu, Xu-Yao Zhang, Cheng-Lin Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24794)  

**Abstract**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning, yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited. We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers. MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing factuality in LRMs.

# RAVR: Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Tianqianjin Lin, Xi Zhao, Xingyao Zhang, Rujiao Long, Yi Xu, Zhuoren Jiang, Wenbo Su, Bo Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25206)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

# KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA 

**Authors**: Zhuo Chen, Fei Wang, Zixuan Li, Zhao Zhang, Weiwei Ding, Chuanguang Yang, Yongjun Xu, Xiaolong Jin, Jiafeng Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25101)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

# Topic-aware Large Language Models for Summarizing the Lived Healthcare Experiences Described in Health Stories 

**Authors**: Maneesh Bilalpur, Megan Hamm, Young Ji Lee, Natasha Norman, Kathleen M. McTigue, Yanshan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24765)  

**Abstract**: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4 model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors, interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management, among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving health outcomes.

# Continual Low-Rank Adapters for LLM-based Generative Recommender Systems 

**Authors**: Hyunsik Yoo, Ting-Wei Li, SeongKu Kang, Zhining Liu, Charlie Xu, Qilin Qi, Hanghang Tong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25093)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors. Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware, direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

# Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback 

**Authors**: Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Fen Lin, Qin Liu, Qingyao Ai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25488)  

**Abstract**: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again, relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents, not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

# TheraMind: A Strategic and Adaptive Agent for Longitudinal Psychological Counseling 

**Authors**: He Hu, Yucheng Zhou, Chiyuan Ma, Qianning Wang, Zheng Zhang, Fei Ma, Laizhong Cui, Qi Tian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25758)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code is publicly available at this https URL.

# Standardization of Psychiatric Diagnoses -- Role of Fine-tuned LLM Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM Enabled Decision Support System 

**Authors**: Eranga Bandara, Ross Gore, Atmaram Yarlagadda, Anita H. Clayton, Preston Samuel, Christopher K. Rhea, Sachin Shetty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25588)  

**Abstract**: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations, primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

**Abstract**: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains. Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

# Predicate Renaming via Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Elisabetta Gentili, Tony Ribeiro, Fabrizio Riguzzi, Katsumi Inoue  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25517)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

**Authors**: Zekun Xu, Siyu Xia, Chuhuai Yue, Jiajun Chai, Mingxue Tian, Xiaohan Wang, Wei Lin, Haoxuan Li, Guojun Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25510)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback, which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\% accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev, significantly outperforming existing approaches.

# FELA: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary System for Feature Engineering of Industrial Event Log Data 

**Authors**: Kun ouyang, Haoyu Wang, Dong Fang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25223)  

**Abstract**: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events, represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.

# Scheduling Your LLM Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Trees 

**Authors**: Hong Wang, Zhezheng Hao, Jian Luo, Chenxing Wei, Yao Shu, Lei Liu, Qiang Lin, Hande Dong, Jiawei Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24832)  

**Abstract**: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's `Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy. However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score (r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

# E-Scores for (In)Correctness Assessment of Generative Model Outputs 

**Authors**: Guneet S. Dhillon, Javier González, Teodora Pandeva, Alicia Curth  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25770)  

**Abstract**: While generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), are ubiquitous in today's world, principled mechanisms to assess their (in)correctness are limited. Using the conformal prediction framework, previous works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an incorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance level. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible to p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the guarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model outputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving the same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores themselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size distortion. We experimentally demonstrate their efficacy in assessing LLM outputs for different correctness types: mathematical factuality and property constraints satisfaction.

# H3M-SSMoEs: Hypergraph-based Multimodal Learning with LLM Reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts 

**Authors**: Peilin Tan, Liang Xie, Churan Zhi, Dian Tu, Chuanqi Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25091)  

**Abstract**: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available at our GitHub repository: this https URL.

# Aligning Large Language Models with Procedural Rules: An Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting for In-Game Trading 

**Authors**: Minkyung Kim, Junsik Kim, Woongcheol Yang, Sangdon Park, Sohee Bae  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25014)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading (browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably, ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

# User Misconceptions of LLM-Based Conversational Programming Assistants 

**Authors**: Gabrielle O'Brien, Antonio Pedro Santos Alves, Sebastian Baltes, Grischa Liebel, Mircea Lungu, Marcos Kalinowski  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25662)  

**Abstract**: Programming assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have become widely available, with conversational assistants like ChatGPT proving particularly accessible to less experienced programmers. However, the varied capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of extensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can and cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here, we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based chatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output generation. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around the scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs. Our findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly communicate their programming capabilities to users.

# GPTOpt: Towards Efficient LLM-Based Black-Box Optimization 

**Authors**: Jamison Meindl, Yunsheng Tian, Tony Cui, Veronika Thost, Zhang-Wei Hong, Jie Chen, Wojciech Matusik, Mina Konaković Luković  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25404)  

**Abstract**: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO) can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

# FT-ARM: Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal Language Model for Pressure Ulcer Severity Classification with Reasoning 

**Authors**: Reza Saadati Fard, Emmanuel Agu, Palawat Busaranuvong, Deepak Kumar, Shefalika Gautam, Bengisu Tulu, Diane Strong, Lorraine Loretz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24980)  

**Abstract**: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern. Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B, achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

# Towards Human-AI Synergy in Requirements Engineering: A Framework and Preliminary Study 

**Authors**: Mateen Ahmed Abbasi, Petri Ihantola, Tommi Mikkonen, Niko Mäkitalo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25016)  

**Abstract**: The future of Requirements Engineering (RE) is increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI), reshaping how we elicit, analyze, and validate requirements. Traditional RE is based on labor-intensive manual processes prone to errors and complexity. AI-powered approaches, specifically large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP), and generative AI, offer transformative solutions and reduce inefficiencies. However, the use of AI in RE also brings challenges like algorithmic bias, lack of explainability, and ethical concerns related to automation. To address these issues, this study introduces the Human-AI RE Synergy Model (HARE-SM), a conceptual framework that integrates AI-driven analysis with human oversight to improve requirements elicitation, analysis, and validation. The model emphasizes ethical AI use through transparency, explainability, and bias mitigation. We outline a multi-phase research methodology focused on preparing RE datasets, fine-tuning AI models, and designing collaborative human-AI workflows. This preliminary study presents the conceptual framework and early-stage prototype implementation, establishing a research agenda and practical design direction for applying intelligent data science techniques to semi-structured and unstructured RE data in collaborative environments.

# SafeEditor: Unified MLLM for Efficient Post-hoc T2I Safety Editing 

**Authors**: Ruiyang Zhang, Jiahao Luo, Xiaoru Feng, Qiufan Pang, Yaodong Yang, Juntao Dai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24820)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.

# The Narrative Continuity Test: A Conceptual Framework for Evaluating Identity Persistence in AI Systems 

**Authors**: Stefano Natangelo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24831)  

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) can now generate coherent text, music, and images, yet they operate without a persistent state: each inference reconstructs context from scratch. This paper introduces the Narrative Continuity Test (NCT) -- a conceptual framework for evaluating identity persistence and diachronic coherence in AI systems. Unlike capability benchmarks that assess task performance, the NCT examines whether an LLM remains the same interlocutor across time and interaction gaps. The framework defines five necessary axes -- Situated Memory, Goal Persistence, Autonomous Self-Correction, Stylistic & Semantic Stability, and Persona/Role Continuity -- and explains why current architectures systematically fail to support them. Case analyses (this http URL, Grok, Replit, Air Canada) show predictable continuity failures under stateless inference. The NCT reframes AI evaluation from performance to persistence, outlining conceptual requirements for future benchmarks and architectural designs that could sustain long-term identity and goal coherence in generative models.

# Perception, Understanding and Reasoning, A Multimodal Benchmark for Video Fake News Detection 

**Authors**: Cui Yakun, Fushuo Huo, Weijie Shi, Juntao Dai, Hang Du, Zhenghao Zhu, Sirui Han, Yike Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24816)  

**Abstract**: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks. Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore, we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring 9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

# From Narrative to Action: A Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework for Human Mobility Generation 

**Authors**: Qiumeng Li, Chunhou Ji, Xinyue Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24802)  

**Abstract**: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent is employed as a "creative writer" to produce diary-style narratives rich in motivation and context, then uses another agent as a "structural parser" to convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.
