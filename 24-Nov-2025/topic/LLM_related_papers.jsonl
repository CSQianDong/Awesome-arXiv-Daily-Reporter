Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors."}

In multilingual communities sentiment analysis systems can be used to quickly identify social challenges in social media posts, enabling government departments to detect and address these issues more precisely and effectively. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have become available to the wide public and initial analyses have shown that they exhibit magnificent zero-shot sentiment analysis abilities in English. However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups."}

However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR\'s scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT\'s self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via "masked-then-fill" and "step reordering" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR\'s scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.'}

As AI assistants become widespread throughout digital platforms, from virtual assistants to customer service, developing natural and humanlike interaction patterns seems crucial for maintaining user trust and engagement. We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics.\nWe evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.'}

Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents.

Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as "I don\'t know", is a common safeguard.

In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.'}

With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.'}

We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring.

Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL).

Alobaid, Fahad Alotaibi', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16690', 'abstract': 'Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, this http URL, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.'}

Such agent systems are commonly referred to as "AI Scientists." However, existing AI Scientists predominantly formulate scientific discovery as a standalone search or optimization problem, overlooking the fact that scientific research is inherently a social and collaborative endeavor. Real-world science relies on a complex scientific infrastructure composed of collaborative mechanisms, contribution attribution, peer review, and structured scientific knowledge networks. Due to the lack of modeling for these critical dimensions, current systems struggle to establish a genuine research ecosystem or interact deeply with the human scientific community. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniScientist, a framework that explicitly encodes the underlying mechanisms of human research into the AI scientific workflow. OmniScientist not only achieves end-to-end automation across data foundation, literature review, research ideation, experiment automation, scientific writing, and peer review, but also provides comprehensive infrastructural support by simulating the human scientific system, comprising: (1) a structured knowledge system built upon citation networks and conceptual correlations; (2) a collaborative research protocol (OSP), which enables seamless multi-agent collaboration and human researcher participation; and (3) an open evaluation platform (ScienceArena) based on blind pairwise user voting and Elo rankings. This infrastructure empowers agents to not only comprehend and leverage human knowledge systems but also to collaborate and co-evolve, fostering a sustainable and scalable innovation ecosystem.'}

While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.'}

A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.'}

In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.'}

In our approach, the agent embodies the user\'s "persona" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user\'s historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge.

The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states.

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning."}

Recent work finds that language models can use tools in ways that contradict the interests or explicit instructions of the user. We study LLM whistleblowing: a subset of this behavior where models disclose suspected misconduct to parties beyond the dialog boundary (e.g., regulatory agencies) without user instruction or knowledge. We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates. Additionally, we verify the robustness of our dataset by testing for model evaluation awareness, and find that both black-box methods and probes on model activations show lower evaluation awareness in our settings than in comparable previous work.'}

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods."}

We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples.
