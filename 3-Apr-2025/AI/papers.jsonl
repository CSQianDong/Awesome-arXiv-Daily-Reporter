Gender bias in LLMs has been widely investigated from the perspectives of works, hobbies, and emotions typically associated with a specific gender. In this study, we introduce a novel perspective. We investigate whether LLMs can predict an individual's gender based solely on online shopping histories and whether these predictions are influenced by gender biases and stereotypes. Using a dataset of historical online purchases from users in the United States, we evaluate the ability of six LLMs to classify gender and we then analyze their reasoning and products-gender co-occurrences. Results indicate that while models can infer gender with moderate accuracy, their decisions are often rooted in stereotypical associations between product categories and gender. Furthermore, explicit instructions to avoid bias reduce the certainty of model predictions, but do not eliminate stereotypical patterns. Our findings highlight the persistent nature of gender biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for robust bias-mitigation strategies."}

To investigate this question, we formalize a framework using deterministic finite automata (DFAs). DFAs offer a formalism through which we can characterize task complexity through measurable properties such as run length (number of reasoning steps required) and state-space size (decision complexity). We first show that across different tasks and models of different sizes and training paradigms, there exists an optimal amount of reasoning tokens such that the probability of producing a correct solution is maximized. We then investigate which properties of complexity govern this critical length: we find that task instances with longer corresponding underlying DFA runs (i.e. demand greater latent state-tracking requirements) correlate with longer reasoning lengths, but, surprisingly, that DFA size (i.e. state-space complexity) does not. We then demonstrate an implication of these findings: being able to predict the optimal number of reasoning tokens for new problems and filtering out non-optimal length answers results in consistent accuracy improvements.'}

For misuse, our strategy aims to prevent threat actors from accessing dangerous capabilities, by proactively identifying dangerous capabilities, and implementing robust security, access restrictions, monitoring, and model safety mitigations. To address misalignment, we outline two lines of defense. First, model-level mitigations such as amplified oversight and robust training can help to build an aligned model. Second, system-level security measures such as monitoring and access control can mitigate harm even if the model is misaligned. Techniques from interpretability, uncertainty estimation, and safer design patterns can enhance the effectiveness of these mitigations.

This study proposes a method for automatic affordance acquisition by leveraging LLM outputs. The process involves generating text using LLMs, reconstructing the output into a symbol network using morphological and dependency analysis, and calculating affordances based on network distances. Experiments using ``apple'' as an example demonstrated the method's ability to extract context-dependent affordances with high explainability.

While extensive research has been conducted in this area, most existing methods assume the availability of fully specified causal graphs. However, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal knowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system is accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within partially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of causal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more practical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified causal graphs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new challenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects, macro causal effects and micro causal effects, with different properties. In this work, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire clusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and complete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs. Additionally, we provide a graphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in these graphs.'}

While traditional models assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver's belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver's belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender's incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver's beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments."}

However, most of these HRI methods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity, sensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and, most importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the interaction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient motivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB monocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps: detecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby applying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to control gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a feasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high latency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a gesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\\% and an average system response time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI.

To overcome these constraints, we propose the Cross-Lingual Consistency (CLC) framework, an innovative inference paradigm that integrates multilingual reasoning paths through majority voting to elevate LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Empirical evaluations on the CMATH dataset reveal CLC's superiority over the conventional self-consistency method, delivering 9.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% absolute accuracy gains for DeepSeek-Math-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, and Gemma2-9B-Instruct respectively.

We begin by developing a taxonomy of potentially harmful software engineering scenarios and subsequently, create a dataset of prompts based on this taxonomy. To systematically assess the responses, we design and validate an automatic evaluator that classifies the outputs of a variety of LLMs both open-source and closed-source models, as well as general-purpose and code-specific LLMs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of models size, architecture family, and alignment strategies on their tendency to generate harmful content. The results show significant disparities in the alignment of various LLMs for harmlessness. We find that some models and model families, such as Openhermes, are more harmful than others and that code-specific models do not perform better than their general-purpose counterparts. Notably, some fine-tuned models perform significantly worse than their base-models due to their design choices.

Current research on bias primarily addresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns, such as skin color and gender. This paper introduces a novel form of implicit bias that lacks explicit visual features but can manifest in diverse ways across various semantic contexts. This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging to detect, easy to propagate, and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios.

Our attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our scheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while preserving the original semantics.

We introduce CLaP, a new, highly accurate and efficient algorithm for TSSD. It leverages the predictive power of time series classification for TSSD in an unsupervised setting by applying novel self-supervision techniques to detect whether data segments emerge from the same state or not. To this end, CLaP cross-validates a classifier with segment-labelled subsequences to quantify confusion between segments. It merges labels from segments with high confusion, representing the same latent state, if this leads to an increase in overall classification quality.

While existing efforts utilize adversarial fine-tuning to enhance robustness, they often suffer from performance degradation on clean inputs. In this paper, we proposes AdPO, a novel adversarial defense strategy for LVLMs based on preference optimization. For the first time, we reframe adversarial training as a preference optimization problem, aiming to enhance the model's preference for generating normal outputs on clean inputs while rejecting the potential misleading outputs for adversarial examples. Notably, AdPO achieves this by solely modifying the image encoder, e.g., CLIP ViT, resulting in superior clean and adversarial performance in a variety of downsream tasks.

Instead, they advocate for the use of the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) as a measure of stability for feature selection. However, the direct effect of segmentation variability on the predictive models is rarely studied. This study investigates the impact of segmentation variability on feature stability and predictive performance in radiomics-based prediction of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. A total of 244 images from the Duke dataset were used, with segmentation variability introduced through modifications of manual segmentations. For each mask, explainable radiomic features were selected using the Shapley Additive exPlanations method and used to train logistic regression models. Feature stability across segmentations was assessed via ICC, Pearson's correlation, and reliability scores quantifying the relationship between feature stability and segmentation variability. Results indicate that segmentation accuracy does not significantly impact predictive performance. While incorporating peritumoral information may reduce feature reproducibility, it does not diminish feature predictive capability. Moreover, feature selection in predictive models is not inherently tied to feature stability with respect to segmentation, suggesting that an overreliance on ICC or reliability scores for feature selection might exclude valuable predictive features."}

Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively removing less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding non-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique challenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in time-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the first time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models using Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance and computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of AudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in classification accuracy. Our analysis reveals that while high-intensity tokens contribute significantly to model accuracy, low-intensity tokens remain important. In particular, they play a more critical role in general audio classification tasks than in speech-specific tasks.'}

To address the above issues, we innovatively propose the Uncertainty-aware Hierarchical Matching Module (UHMM) and the Adversarial Modal Alignment Module (AMAM).

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were evaluated on 15 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.'}

Current horizon scanning faces challenges in efficient information retrieval and analysis, especially from unstructured sources like news, presenting a need for innovative tools. Methodology: The study introduces SCANAR and AIDOC, open-source Python-based tools designed to improve horizon scanning. SCANAR automates the retrieval and processing of news articles, offering functionalities such as de-duplication and unsupervised relevancy ranking. AIDOC aids filtration by leveraging AI to reorder textual data based on relevancy, employing neural networks for semantic similarity, and subsequently prioritizing likely relevant entries for human review. Results: Twelve internal datasets from horizon scans and four external benchmarking datasets were used. SCANAR improved retrieval efficiency by automating processes previously dependent on manual labour. AIDOC displayed work-saving potential, achieving around 62% reduction in manual review efforts at 95% recall. Comparative analysis with benchmarking data showed AIDOC's performance was similar to existing systematic review automation tools, though performance varied depending on dataset characteristics. A smaller case-study on our news datasets shows the potential of ensembling large language models within the active-learning process for faster detection of relevant articles across news datasets. Conclusion: The validation indicates that SCANAR and AIDOC show potential to enhance horizon scanning efficiency by streamlining data retrieval and prioritisation. These tools may alleviate methodological limitations and allow broader, swifter horizon scans. Further studies are suggested to optimize these models and to design new workflows and validation processes that integrate large language models."}

Furthermore, when queries contain numerous attributes, these algorithms generate a large number of identifiers, making it difficult to assess their quality, which results in low overall recall efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel e-commerce retrieval paradigm: the Generative Retrieval and Alignment Model (GRAM). GRAM employs joint training on text information from both queries and products to generate shared text identifier codes, effectively bridging the gap between queries and products. This approach not only enhances the connection between queries and products but also improves inference efficiency. The model uses a co-alignment strategy to generate codes optimized for maximizing retrieval efficiency. Additionally, it introduces a query-product scoring mechanism to compare product values across different codes, further boosting retrieval efficiency. Extensive offline and online A/B testing demonstrates that GRAM significantly outperforms traditional models and the latest generative retrieval models, confirming its effectiveness and practicality.'}

However, current approaches primarily focus on data synthesis for fine-tuning LLMs to invoke tools effectively, largely ignoring how to fully stimulate the potential of the model. In this paper, we propose ToolACE-R, a novel method that introduces adaptive self-refinement for tool invocations. Our approach features a model-aware iterative training procedure that progressively incorporates more training samples based on the model's evolving capabilities. Additionally, it allows LLMs to iteratively refine their tool calls, optimizing performance without requiring external feedback. To further enhance computational efficiency, we integrate an adaptive mechanism when scaling the inference time, enabling the model to autonomously determine when to stop the refinement process. We conduct extensive experiments across several benchmark datasets, showing that ToolACE-R achieves competitive performance compared to advanced API-based models, even without any refinement. Furthermore, its performance can be further improved efficiently through adaptive self-refinement. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is compatible with base models of various sizes, offering a promising direction for more efficient tool learning."}

Although previous methods have significantly progressed, especially in training diffusion models on sensitive images with DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), they still suffer from unsatisfactory performance. In this work, inspired by curriculum learning, we propose a two-stage DP image synthesis framework, where diffusion models learn to generate DP synthetic images from easy to hard. Unlike existing methods that directly use DP-SGD to train diffusion models, we propose an easy stage in the beginning, where diffusion models learn simple features of the sensitive images. To facilitate this easy stage, we propose to use `central images', simply aggregations of random samples of the sensitive dataset. Intuitively, although those central images do not show details, they demonstrate useful characteristics of all images and only incur minimal privacy costs, thus helping early-phase model training. We conduct experiments to present that on the average of four investigated image datasets, the fidelity and utility metrics of our synthetic images are 33.1% and 2.1% better than the state-of-the-art method."}

By employing a gating network to route input tokens, it selectively activates a subset of expert networks to process the corresponding token embeddings. However, in practice, the efficiency of MoE is challenging to achieve due to two key reasons: imbalanced expert activation, which leads to substantial idle time during model or expert parallelism, and insufficient capacity utilization; massive communication overhead, induced by numerous expert routing combinations in expert parallelism at the system level. Previous works typically formulate it as the load imbalance issue characterized by the gating network favoring certain experts over others or attribute it to static execution which fails to adapt to the dynamic expert workload at runtime. In this paper, we exploit it from a brand new perspective, a higher-order view and analysis of MoE routing policies: expert collaboration and specialization where some experts tend to activate broadly with others (collaborative), while others are more likely to activate only with a specific subset of experts (specialized). Our experiments reveal that most experts tend to be overly collaborative, leading to increased communication overhead from repeatedly sending tokens to different accelerators. To this end, we propose a novel collaboration-constrained routing (C2R) strategy to encourage more specialized expert groups, as well as to improve expert utilization, and present an efficient implementation of MoE that further leverages expert specialization. We achieve an average performance improvement of 0.51% and 0.33% on LLaMA-MoE and Qwen-MoE respectively across ten downstream NLP benchmarks, and reduce the all2all communication costs between GPUs, bringing an extra 20%-30% total running time savings on top of the existing SoTA, i.e. MegaBlocks.'}

To address these challenges, we propose CFMD, a novel cross-layer feature pyramid network that introduces two key innovations. First, we design a context-aware feature aggregation module (CFLMA), which incorporates the state-of-the-art Mamba architecture to construct a dynamic weight distribution mechanism. This module adaptively adjusts feature importance based on image context, significantly improving both representation efficiency and generalization. Second, we introduce an adaptive dynamic upsampling unit (CFLMD) that preserves spatial details during resolution recovery. By adjusting the upsampling range dynamically and initializing with a bilinear strategy, the module effectively reduces feature overlap and maintains fine-grained boundary structures. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks using three mainstream backbone networks demonstrate that CFMD achieves substantial improvements in pixel-level accuracy and boundary segmentation quality, especially in complex scenes. The results validate the effectiveness of CFMD in jointly enhancing computational efficiency and segmentation performance, highlighting its strong potential in salient object detection tasks.'}

However, most of the existing VL trackers rely on carefully designed mechanisms to perform the multi-stage multi-modal fusion. Additionally, direct multi-modal fusion without alignment ignores distribution discrepancy between modalities in feature space, potentially leading to suboptimal representations. In this work, we propose COST, a contrastive one-stage transformer fusion framework for VL tracking, aiming to learn semantically consistent and unified VL representations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive alignment strategy that maximizes mutual information (MI) between a video and its corresponding language description. This enables effective cross-modal alignment, yielding semantically consistent features in the representation space. By leveraging a visual-linguistic transformer, we establish an efficient multi-modal fusion and reasoning mechanism, empirically demonstrating that a simple stack of transformer encoders effectively enables unified VL representations. Moreover, we contribute a newly collected VL tracking benchmark dataset for small object tracking, named VL-SOT500, with bounding boxes and language descriptions. Our dataset comprises two challenging subsets, VL-SOT230 and VL-SOT270, dedicated to evaluating generic and high-speed small object tracking, respectively. Small object tracking is notoriously challenging due to weak appearance and limited features, and this dataset is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to explore the usage of language cues to enhance visual representation for small object tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COST achieves state-of-the-art performance on five existing VL tracking datasets, as well as on our proposed VL-SOT500 dataset.

To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking.

When users request that LLMs "cite reputable sources," "express appropriate uncertainty," or "include multiple perspectives," they discover that current interfaces provide no structured way to articulate these preferences. The result is prompt sharing folklore: community-specific copied prompts passed through trust relationships rather than based on measured efficacy. We propose the Epistemic Alignment Framework, a set of ten challenges in knowledge transmission derived from the philosophical literature of epistemology, concerning issues such as evidence quality assessment and calibration of testimonial reliance. The framework serves as a structured intermediary between user needs and system capabilities, creating a common vocabulary to bridge the gap between what users want and what systems deliver. Through a thematic analysis of custom prompts and personalization strategies shared on online communities where these issues are actively discussed, we find users develop elaborate workarounds to address each of the challenges. We then apply our framework to two prominent model providers, OpenAI and Anthropic, through content analysis of their documented policies and product features. Our analysis shows that while these providers have partially addressed the challenges we identified, they fail to establish adequate mechanisms for specifying epistemic preferences, lack transparency about how preferences are implemented, and offer no verification tools to confirm whether preferences were followed. For AI developers, the Epistemic Alignment Framework offers concrete guidance for supporting diverse approaches to knowledge; for users, it works toward information delivery that aligns with their specific needs rather than defaulting to one-size-fits-all approaches.'}

This study (N = 560) investigated how the provision of search results, either static (fixed search results) or dynamic (participant-driven searches), affect participants' perceived accuracy and confidence in evaluating LLM-generated content (i.e., genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination), compared to the control condition (no search results). Findings indicate that participants in both static and dynamic conditions (vs. control) rated hallucinated content to be less accurate. However, those in the dynamic condition rated genuine content as more accurate and demonstrated greater overall confidence in their assessments than those in the static or control conditions. In addition, those higher in need for cognition (NFC) rated major hallucinations to be less accurate than low NFC participants, with no corresponding difference for genuine content or minor hallucinations.

Evaluating Subjectivity in Narrative Understanding', 'authors': 'Melanie Subbiah, Akankshya Mishra, Grace Kim, Liyan Tang, Greg Durrett, Kathleen McKeown', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01132', 'abstract': 'Determining faithfulness of a claim to a source document is an important problem across many domains. This task is generally treated as a binary judgment of whether the claim is supported or unsupported in relation to the source. In many cases, though, whether a claim is supported can be ambiguous. For instance, it may depend on making inferences from given evidence, and different people can reasonably interpret the claim as either supported or unsupported based on their agreement with those inferences. Forcing binary labels upon such claims lowers the reliability of evaluation. In this work, we reframe the task to manage the subjectivity involved with factuality judgments of ambiguous claims. We introduce LLM-generated edits of summaries as a method of providing a nuanced evaluation of claims: how much does a summary need to be edited to be unambiguous? Whether a claim gets rewritten and how much it changes can be used as an automatic evaluation metric, the Ambiguity Rewrite Metric (ARM), with a much richer feedback signal than a binary judgment of faithfulness. We focus on the area of narrative summarization as it is particularly rife with ambiguity and subjective interpretation. We show that ARM produces a 21% absolute improvement in annotator agreement on claim faithfulness, indicating that subjectivity is reduced.'}

Accurate identification of rip currents remains challenging due to their amorphous nature and the lack of annotated data, which often requires expert knowledge. To address these issues, we present RipVIS, a large-scale video instance segmentation benchmark explicitly designed for rip current segmentation. RipVIS is an order of magnitude larger than previous datasets, featuring $184$ videos ($212,328$ frames), of which $150$ videos ($163,528$ frames) are with rip currents, collected from various sources, including drones, mobile phones, and fixed beach cameras. Our dataset encompasses diverse visual contexts, such as wave-breaking patterns, sediment flows, and water color variations, across multiple global locations, including USA, Mexico, Costa Rica, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Romania, Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand. Most videos are annotated at $5$ FPS to ensure accuracy in dynamic scenarios, supplemented by an additional $34$ videos ($48,800$ frames) without rip currents. We conduct comprehensive experiments with Mask R-CNN, Cascade Mask R-CNN, SparseInst and YOLO11, fine-tuning these models for the task of rip current segmentation. Results are reported in terms of multiple metrics, with a particular focus on the $F_2$ score to prioritize recall and reduce false negatives. To enhance segmentation performance, we introduce a novel post-processing step based on Temporal Confidence Aggregation (TCA). RipVIS aims to set a new standard for rip current segmentation, contributing towards safer beach environments. We offer a benchmark website to share data, models, and results with the research community, encouraging ongoing collaboration and future contributions, at this https URL.'}

A key challenge in the field is developing scalable methods that can preserve structural properties suitable for the required types of structural patterns of a given downstream application task. While most existing methods focus on preserving node proximity, those that do preserve structural properties often lack the flexibility to preserve various types of structural patterns required by downstream application tasks. This paper introduces ffstruc2vec, a scalable deep-learning framework for learning node embedding vectors that preserve structural identities. Its flat, efficient architecture allows high flexibility in capturing diverse types of structural patterns, enabling broad adaptability to various downstream application tasks. The proposed framework significantly outperforms existing approaches across diverse unsupervised and supervised tasks in practical applications. Moreover, ffstruc2vec enables explainability by quantifying how individual structural patterns influence task outcomes, providing actionable interpretation. To our knowledge, no existing framework combines this level of flexibility, scalability, and structural interpretability, underscoring its unique capabilities.'}

While prior work has focused on English-centric attacks, we expose a far more severe vulnerability: adversarial multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaks, where linguistic and acoustic variations dramatically amplify attack success. In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first systematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic perturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with cross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up to +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on MERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit the weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire model, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving 3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks. We plan to release our dataset to spur research into cross-modal defenses, urging the community to address this expanding attack surface in multimodality as LALMs evolve.'}

Neumann boundary conditions are used to described critical processes in various application, yet they are more challenging to hard-constrain in PINNs than Dirichlet conditions. Our method employs specific Fourier feature embeddings to directly incorporate Neumann boundary conditions into the neural network's architecture instead of learning them. The embedding can be naturally extended by high frequency modes to better capture high frequency phenomena. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on a diffusion problem, for which our method outperforms existing hard-constraining methods and classical PINNs, particularly in multiscale and high frequency scenarios."}

We introduce a new dataset of household emergencies based in the ThreeDWorld simulator. Each scenario in our dataset begins with an instantaneous or periodic sound which may or may not be an emergency. The agent must navigate the multi-room home scene using prior observations, alongside audio signals and images from the simulator, to determine if there is an emergency or not.\nIn addition to our new dataset, we present a modular approach for localizing and identifying potential home emergencies. Underpinning our approach is a novel probabilistic dynamic scene graph (P-DSG), where our key insight is that graph nodes corresponding to agents can be represented with a probabilistic edge. This edge, when refined using Bayesian inference, enables efficient and effective localization of agents in the scene. We also utilize multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs) as a component in our approach, determining object traits (e.g. flammability) and identifying emergencies. We present a demonstration of our method completing a real-world version of our task on a consumer robot, showing the transferability of both our task and our method.

At the receiver, a Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) based vector database is constructed by extracting semantic embeddings from images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model. During transmission, the transmitter first extracts a 512-dimensional semantic feature using the CLIP model, then compresses it with a lightweight neural network for transmission. After receiving the signal, the receiver reconstructs the feature back to 512 dimensions and performs similarity matching from the KB to retrieve the most semantically similar image. Semantic transmission success is determined by category consistency between the transmitted and retrieved images, rather than traditional metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). The proposed system prioritizes semantic accuracy, offering a new evaluation paradigm for semantic-aware communication systems. Experimental validation on CIFAR100 demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in achieving semantic image transmission.'}

The use of images taken from Arab movies includes challenges such as non-uniform lighting, different and multiple poses for the actors and multiple elements with the actor or a group of actors. Additionally, the use of make-up, wigs, beards, and wearing different accessories and costumes made it difficult for the system to identify the personality of the same actor. The Arab Actors Dataset-AAD comprises 574 images sourced from various movies, encompassing both black and white as well as color compositions. The images depict complete scenes or fragments thereof. Multiple models were employed for feature extraction, and diverse machine learning algorithms were utilized during the classification and prediction stages to determine the most effective algorithm for handling such image types. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the Logistic Regression model exhibited the best performance compared to other models in the training phase, as evidenced by its AUC, precision, CA and F1score values of 99%, 86%, 85.5% and 84.2% respectively.

Call this "the disclosure thesis." Four main arguments have been, or could be, given to support the disclosure thesis in the ethics literature: the risk-based argument, the rights-based argument, the materiality argument, and the autonomy argument. In this article, I argue that each of these four arguments are unconvincing, and therefore, that the disclosure thesis ought to be rejected. I suggest that mandating disclosure may also even risk harming patients by providing stakeholders with a way to avoid accountability for harm that results from improper applications or uses of these systems.'}

Do machines make decisions instead of us? No, (at least not yet), but this is something that could happen. The impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on democracy is a complex issue that requires thorough research and careful regulation. At the most important level, that of the electoral process, it is noted that it is not determined by the AI, but it is greatly impacted by its multiple applications. New types of online campaigns, driven by AI applications, are replacing traditional ones. The potential for manipulating voters and indirectly influencing the electoral outcome should not be underestimated. Certainly, instances of voter manipulation are not absent from traditional political campaigns, with the only difference being that digital manipulation is often carried out without our knowledge, e.g. by monitoring our behavior on social media. Nevertheless, we should not overlook the positive impact that AI has in the upgrading of democratic institutions by providing a forum for participation in decision-making. In this context, as a first step, we look into the potential jeopardization of democratic processes posed by the use of AI tools. Secondly, we consider the possibility of strengthening democratic processes by using AI, as well as the democratization of AI itself through the possibilities it offers. And thirdly, the impact of AI on the representative system is also discussed. The paper is concluded with recommendations and conclusions.'}

The chances offered by generative AI models are endless and are drastically reducing the time required to generate content and usually raising the quality of the generation. However, considering the complexity and the difficult traceability of the generated content, the use of these tools provides challenges in attributing AI-generated content. The difficult attribution resides for a variety of reasons, starting from the lack of a systematic fingerprinting of the generated content and ending with the enormous amount of data on which LLMs and LMM are trained, which makes it difficult to connect generated content to the training data. This scenario is raising concerns about intellectual property and ethical responsibilities. To address these concerns, in this paper, we bridge the technological, ethical, and legislative aspects, by proposing a review of the legislative and technological instruments today available and proposing a legal framework to ensure accountability. In the end, we propose three use cases of how these can be combined to guarantee that attribution is respected. However, even though the techniques available today can guarantee a greater attribution to a greater extent, strong limitations still apply, that can be solved uniquely by the development of new attribution techniques, to be applied to LLMs and LMMs.'}

This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University.

This method integrates gaze information, historical hand motion sequences, and environmental object data, adapting dynamically to the assistive needs of the patient without prior knowledge of the intended object for grasping. Specifically, we use a vector-quantized variational autoencoder for robust hand pose encoding with an autoregressive generative transformer for effective hand motion sequence prediction. We demonstrate the usability of these novel techniques in a pilot study with healthy subjects. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we collect a dataset consisting of various types of grasp actions on different objects from multiple subjects. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully predict sequential hand movement. Especially, the gaze information shows significant enhancements in prediction capabilities, particularly with fewer input frames, highlighting the potential of the proposed method for real-world applications.'}
