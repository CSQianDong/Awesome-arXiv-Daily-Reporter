**Authors**: Tong Chen, Akari Asai, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Faeze Brahman

**Abstract**: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward (RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3% reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering, the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know" when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7% fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following, math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality, induces quality regressions.

# QueST: Incentivizing LLMs to Generate Difficult Problems 

**Authors**: Hanxu Hu, Xingxing Zhang, Jannis Vamvas, Rico Sennrich, Furu Wei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17715)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks, solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST, a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

**Authors**: Raghu Vamshi Hemadri, Geetha Krishna Guruju, Kristi Topollai, Anna Ewa Choromanska  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17532)  

**Abstract**: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

# Leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization to Advance Large Language Models in Traditional Chinese Medicine 

**Authors**: Jiacheng Xie, Shuai Zeng, Yang Yu, Xiaoting Tang, Guanghui An, Dong Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17402)  

**Abstract**: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

# SafeSearch: Do Not Trade Safety for Utility in LLM Search Agents 

**Authors**: Qiusi Zhan, Angeline Budiman-Chan, Abdelrahman Zayed, Xingzhi Guo, Daniel Kang, Joo-Kyung Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17017)  

**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries, retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions. While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.

# Online Learning Defense against Iterative Jailbreak Attacks via Prompt Optimization 

**Authors**: Masahiro Kaneko, Zeerak Talat, Timothy Baldwin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17006)  

**Abstract**: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for harmless tasks.

# Beacon: Single-Turn Diagnosis and Mitigation of Latent Sycophancy in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Sanskar Pandey, Ruhaan Chopra, Angkul Puniya, Sohom Pal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16727)  

**Abstract**: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

# RAVEN: Robust Advertisement Video Violation Temporal Grounding via Reinforcement Reasoning 

**Authors**: Deyi Ji, Yuekui Yang, Haiyang Wu, Shaoping Ma, Tianrun Chen, Lanyun Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16455)  

**Abstract**: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall. RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

# Thinking About Thinking: Evaluating Reasoning in Post-Trained Language Models 

**Authors**: Pratham Singla, Shivank Garg, Ayush Singh, Ishan Garg, Ketan Suhaas Saichandran  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16340)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and "think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

# EvolveR: Self-Evolving LLM Agents through an Experience-Driven Lifecycle 

**Authors**: Rong Wu, Xiaoman Wang, Jianbiao Mei, Pinlong Cai, Daocheng Fu, Cheng Yang, Licheng Wen, Xuemeng Yang, Yufan Shen, Yuxin Wang, Botian Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16079)  

**Abstract**: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

# VAGEN: Reinforcing World Model Reasoning for Multi-Turn VLM Agents 

**Authors**: Kangrui Wang, Pingyue Zhang, Zihan Wang, Yaning Gao, Linjie Li, Qineng Wang, Hanyang Chen, Chi Wan, Yiping Lu, Zhengyuan Yang, Lijuan Wang, Ranjay Krishna, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei, Yejin Choi, Manling Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16907)  

**Abstract**: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments. Code and data are publicly available at this https URL.

# Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers 

**Authors**: Archie Chaudhury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16167)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework, particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized: mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather than diffuse and parameteric.

# Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin? 

**Authors**: Kangqi Ni, Zhen Tan, Zijie Liu, Pingzhi Li, Tianlong Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15990)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch, evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution (ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

# Coinvisor: An RL-Enhanced Chatbot Agent for Interactive Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis 

**Authors**: Chong Chen, Ze Liu, Lingfeng Bao, Yanlin Wang, Ting Chen, Daoyuan Wu, Jiachi Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17235)  

**Abstract**: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).

# Count Counts: Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards 

**Authors**: Xuan Zhang, Ruixiao Li, Zhijian Zhou, Long Li, Yulei Qin, Ke Li, Xing Sun, Xiaoyu Tan, Chao Qu, Yuan Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16614)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.

# Urban-R1: Reinforced MLLMs Mitigate Geospatial Biases for Urban General Intelligence 

**Authors**: Qiongyan Wang, Xingchen Zou, Yutian Jiang, Haomin Wen, Jiaheng Wei, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16555)  

**Abstract**: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence (UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence.

# NP-Engine: Empowering Optimization Reasoning in Large Language Models with Verifiable Synthetic NP Problems 

**Authors**: Xiaozhe Li, Xinyu Fang, Shengyuan Ding, Linyang Li, Haodong Duan, Qingwen Liu, Kai Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16476)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.

# Foundational Automatic Evaluators: Scaling Multi-Task Generative Evaluator Training for Reasoning-Centric Domains 

**Authors**: Austin Xu, Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Yilun Zhou, Chien-Sheng Wu, Caiming Xiong, Shafiq Joty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17793)  

**Abstract**: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

# CrossGuard: Safeguarding MLLMs against Joint-Modal Implicit Malicious Attacks 

**Authors**: Xu Zhang, Hao Li, Zhichao Lu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17687)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong reasoning and perception capabilities but are increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While existing work focuses on explicit attacks, where malicious content resides in a single modality, recent studies reveal implicit attacks, in which benign text and image inputs jointly express unsafe intent. Such joint-modal threats are difficult to detect and remain underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality implicit data. We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on this dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard providing robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit threats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and explicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that CrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced MLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high utility. This offers a balanced and practical solution for enhancing MLLM robustness against real-world multimodal threats.

# TabR1: Taming GRPO for tabular reasoning LLMs 

**Authors**: Pengxiang Cai, Zihao Gao, Jintai Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17385)  

**Abstract**: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

# Auto-Rubric: Learning to Extract Generalizable Criteria for Reward Modeling 

**Authors**: Lipeng Xie, Sen Huang, Zhuo Zhang, Anni Zou, Yunpeng Zhai, Dingchao Ren, Kezun Zhang, Haoyuan Hu, Boyin Liu, Haoran Chen, Zhaoyang Liu, Bolin Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17314)  

**Abstract**: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization, creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption: \textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality, query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided \textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an \textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance. Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized, fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and data-efficient path for reward modeling.

# The Ends Justify the Thoughts: RL-Induced Motivated Reasoning in LLMs 

**Authors**: Nikolaus Howe, Micah Carroll  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17057)  

**Abstract**: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.

**Abstract**: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models. Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples. To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems, firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

**Abstract**: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines, validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.
