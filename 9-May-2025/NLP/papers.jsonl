However, these methods suffer from the issues of verbosity and likelihood displacement, which can be driven by the noisy preference pairs that induce similar likelihood for preferred and dispreferred responses. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new preference alignment method based on comparison oracles and provide the convergence guarantee for its basic scheme. Second, we improve our method using some heuristics and conduct the experiments to demonstrate the flexibility and compatibility of practical scheme in improving the performance of LLMs using noisy preference pairs. Evaluations are conducted across multiple base and instruction-tuned models (Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B and Gemma-2-9B) with benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench and Arena-Hard). Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method as an alternative to addressing the limitations of existing direct alignment methods. A highlight of our work is that we evidence the importance of designing specialized methods for preference pairs with distinct likelihood margin, which complements the recent findings in \\citet{Razin-2025-Unintentional}.'}

In this work, we explore to compose perception and reasoning through model merging that connects parameters of different models. Unlike previous works that often focus on merging models of the same kind, we propose merging models across modalities, enabling the incorporation of the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into VLMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that model merging offers a successful pathway to transfer reasoning abilities from LLMs to VLMs in a training-free manner. Moreover, we utilize the merged models to understand the internal mechanism of perception and reasoning and how merging affects it. We find that perception capabilities are predominantly encoded in the early layers of the model, whereas reasoning is largely facilitated by the middle-to-late layers. After merging, we observe that all layers begin to contribute to reasoning, whereas the distribution of perception abilities across layers remains largely unchanged. These observations shed light on the potential of model merging as a tool for multimodal integration and interpretation.'}

Model-driven data filtering has increasingly become a primary approach for acquiring high-quality data. However, it still faces two main challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient data verification strategy makes it difficult to provide timely feedback on data quality; and (2) the selection of seed data for training classifiers lacks clear criteria and relies heavily on human expertise, introducing a degree of subjectivity. To address the first challenge, we introduce an efficient verification strategy that enables rapid evaluation of the impact of data on LLM training with minimal computational cost. To tackle the second challenge, we build upon the assumption that high-quality seed data is beneficial for LLM training, and by integrating the proposed verification strategy, we optimize the selection of positive and negative samples and propose an efficient data filtering pipeline. This pipeline not only improves filtering efficiency, classifier quality, and robustness, but also significantly reduces experimental and inference costs. In addition, to efficiently filter high-quality data, we employ a lightweight classifier based on fastText, and successfully apply the filtering pipeline to two widely-used pre-training corpora, FineWeb and Chinese FineWeb datasets, resulting in the creation of the higher-quality Ultra-FineWeb dataset. Ultra-FineWeb contains approximately 1 trillion English tokens and 120 billion Chinese tokens. Empirical results demonstrate that the LLMs trained on Ultra-FineWeb exhibit significant performance improvements across multiple benchmark tasks, validating the effectiveness of our pipeline in enhancing both data quality and training efficiency.'}

However, existing evaluation metrics prioritize mechanical accuracy over artistic expression and tend to overrate machine translation (MT) as being superior to experienced professional human translation. In the long run, this bias could result in a permanent decline in translation quality and cultural authenticity. In response to the urgent need for a specialized literary evaluation metric, we introduce TransProQA, a novel, reference-free, LLM-based question-answering (QA) framework designed specifically for literary translation evaluation. TransProQA uniquely integrates insights from professional literary translators and researchers, focusing on critical elements in literary quality assessment such as literary devices, cultural understanding, and authorial voice. Our extensive evaluation shows that while literary-finetuned XCOMET-XL yields marginal gains, TransProQA substantially outperforms current metrics, achieving up to 0.07 gain in correlation (ACC-EQ and Kendall's tau) and surpassing the best state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics by over 15 points in adequacy assessments. Incorporating professional translator insights as weights further improves performance, highlighting the value of translator inputs. Notably, TransProQA approaches human-level evaluation performance comparable to trained linguistic annotators. It demonstrates broad applicability to open-source models such as LLaMA3.3-70b and Qwen2.5-32b, indicating its potential as an accessible and training-free literary evaluation metric and a valuable tool for evaluating texts that require local processing due to copyright or ethical considerations."}

We evaluate CoT faithfulness of state-of-the-art reasoning models across 6 reasoning hints presented in the prompts and find: (1) for most settings and models tested, CoTs reveal their usage of hints in at least 1% of examples where they use the hint, but the reveal rate is often below 20%, (2) outcome-based reinforcement learning initially improves faithfulness but plateaus without saturating, and (3) when reinforcement learning increases how frequently hints are used (reward hacking), the propensity to verbalize them does not increase, even without training against a CoT monitor. These results suggest that CoT monitoring is a promising way of noticing undesired behaviors during training and evaluations, but that it is not sufficient to rule them out.

Second, we reveal that while English-centric RLM's CoTs are naturally predominantly English, they consistently follow a quote-and-think pattern to reason about quoted non-English inputs. Third, we discover an effective strategy to control the language of long CoT reasoning, and we observe that models reason better and more efficiently in high-resource languages. Finally, we observe poor out-of-domain reasoning generalization, in particular from STEM to cultural commonsense knowledge, even for English. Overall, we demonstrate the potentials, study the mechanisms and outline the limitations of crosslingual generalization of English reasoning test-time scaling.

Our analysis reveals that, particularly in politically and socially sensitive contexts, LLMs tend to exhibit more pronounced framing than their human counterparts.

ICon comprises three components and identifies high-contribution data by assessing performance shifts under implicit learning through ICL. Extensive experiments on three LLMs across 12 benchmarks and 5 pairwise evaluation sets demonstrate the effectiveness of ICon.

Yu', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05271', 'abstract': 'Aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) aims to extract triplets composed of aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarities from given sentences. The table tagging method is a popular approach to addressing this task, which encodes a sentence into a 2-dimensional table, allowing for the tagging of relations between any two words. Previous efforts have focused on designing various downstream relation learning modules to better capture interactions between tokens in the table, revealing that a stronger capability to capture relations can lead to greater improvements in the model. Motivated by this, we attempt to directly utilize transformer layers as downstream relation learning modules. Due to the powerful semantic modeling capability of transformers, it is foreseeable that this will lead to excellent improvement. However, owing to the quadratic relation between the length of the table and the length of the input sentence sequence, using transformers directly faces two challenges: overly long table sequences and unfair local attention interaction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Table-Transformer (T-T) for the tagging-based ASTE method. Specifically, we introduce a stripe attention mechanism with a loop-shift strategy to tackle these challenges. The former modifies the global attention mechanism to only attend to a 2-dimensional local attention window, while the latter facilitates interaction between different attention windows. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the T-T, as a downstream relation learning module, achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower computational costs.'}

We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected.

In this paper, we investigate under which conditions language models can perform these strategies correctly based on zero-shot learning and analyse whether the formatting of the group scenario in the prompt affects accuracy. We specifically focused on the impact of group complexity (number of users and items), different LLMs, different prompting conditions, including In-Context learning or generating explanations, and the formatting of group preferences. Our results show that performance starts to deteriorate when considering more than 100 ratings. However, not all language models were equally sensitive to growing group complexity. Additionally, we showed that In-Context Learning (ICL) can significantly increase the performance at higher degrees of group complexity, while adding other prompt modifications, specifying domain cues or prompting for explanations, did not impact accuracy. We conclude that future research should include group complexity as a factor in GRS evaluation due to its effect on LLM performance. Furthermore, we showed that formatting the group scenarios differently, such as rating lists per user or per item, affected accuracy.

LPC seamlessly integrates with various offline alignment algorithms, automatically inferring the underlying factors and their importance from data without relying on pre-defined reward functions and hand-crafted combination weights.

This approach has revealed that several power laws consistently emerge across different corpora and languages, suggesting the universal principles underlying languages. Particularly, the power-law decay of correlation has been interpreted as evidence for underlying hierarchical structures in syntax, semantics, and discourse. This perspective has also been extended to child languages and animal signals. However, the argument supporting this interpretation has not been empirically tested. To address this problem, this study examines the validity of the argument for syntactic structures. Specifically, we test whether the statistical properties of parse trees align with the implicit assumptions in the argument. Using English corpora, we analyze the mutual information, deviations from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), and other properties in parse trees, as well as in the PCFG that approximates these trees. Our results indicate that the assumptions do not hold for syntactic structures and that it is difficult to apply the proposed argument to child languages and animal signals, highlighting the need to reconsider the relationship between the power law and hierarchical structures.'}

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

This study presents two open-source embedding models fine-tuned for educational question answering, particularly in the context of course syllabi. A synthetic dataset of 3,197 sentence pairs, spanning synonymous terminology, paraphrased questions, and implicit-explicit mappings, was constructed through a combination of manual curation and large language model (LLM)-assisted generation. Two training strategies were evaluated: (1) a baseline model fine-tuned using MultipleNegativesRankingLoss (MNRL), and (2) a dual-loss model that combines MNRL with CosineSimilarityLoss to improve both semantic ranking and similarity calibration. Evaluations were conducted on 28 university course syllabi using a fixed set of natural language questions categorized into course, faculty, and teaching assistant information. Results demonstrate that both fine-tuned models outperform strong open-source baselines, including all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1, and that the dual-loss model narrows the performance gap with high-performing proprietary embeddings such as OpenAI's text-embedding-3 series.

This study first outlines the principles of Large Language Model (LLM), especially the self-attention mechanism based on the Transformer architecture, and how to enable the model to understand and generate natural language text. Then, the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and the attention mechanism are combined to construct an algorithmic model for personalized advertising recommendations and user factor risk protection. The specific steps include: data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and construction, using large language models such as BERT for advertising semantic embedding, and ad recommendations based on user portraits. Then, local model training and data encryption are used to ensure the security of user privacy and avoid the leakage of personal data. This paper designs an experiment for personalized advertising recommendation based on a large language model of BERT and verifies it with real user data. The experimental results show that BERT-based advertising push can effectively improve the click-through rate and conversion rate of advertisements. At the same time, through local model training and privacy protection mechanisms, the risk of user privacy leakage can be reduced to a certain extent.'}

Leveraging the power of diffusion models, known for high-fidelity generative capabilities, we adapt text-to-image diffusion strategies by conditioning on source speech transcriptions and generating Mel spectrograms representing the target speech with desired linguistic and accentual attributes. This integrated framework enables joint optimization of translation and accent adaptation, offering a more parameter-efficient and effective model compared to traditional pipelines."}

This research presents a systematic investigation into the parallels between human cross-modal chunking mechanisms and token representation methodologies in MLLMs. Through empirical studies comparing human performance patterns with model behaviors across visual-linguistic tasks, we demonstrate that conventional static tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain current models' capacity to simulate the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human information processing. We propose a novel framework for dynamic cross-modal tokenization that incorporates adaptive boundaries, hierarchical representations, and alignment mechanisms grounded in cognitive science principles. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on benchmark tasks (+7.8% on Visual Question Answering, +5.3% on Complex Scene Description) while exhibiting more human-aligned error patterns and attention distributions. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of the relationship between human cognition and artificial intelligence, while providing empirical evidence for developing more cognitively plausible AI systems."}

A Benchmark for LLMs' Capabilities in Multi-user Multi-turn Social Agent Tasks", 'authors': 'Yusen Wu, Junwu Xiong, Xiaotie Deng', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04628', 'abstract': "Expanding the application of large language models (LLMs) to societal life, instead of primary function only as auxiliary assistants to communicate with only one person at a time, necessitates LLMs' capabilities to independently play roles in multi-user, multi-turn social agent tasks within complex social settings. However, currently the capability has not been systematically measured with available benchmarks. To address this gap, we first introduce an agent task leveling framework grounded in sociological principles. Concurrently, we propose a novel benchmark, How Social Is It (we call it HSII below), designed to assess LLM's social capabilities in comprehensive social agents tasks and benchmark representative models. HSII comprises four stages: format parsing, target selection, target switching conversation, and stable conversation, which collectively evaluate the communication and task completion capabilities of LLMs within realistic social interaction scenarios dataset, HSII-Dataset. The dataset is derived step by step from news dataset. We perform an ablation study by doing clustering to the dataset. Additionally, we investigate the impact of chain of thought (COT) method on enhancing LLMs' social performance. Since COT cost more computation, we further introduce a new statistical metric, COT-complexity, to quantify the efficiency of certain LLMs with COTs for specific social tasks and strike a better trade-off between measurement of correctness and efficiency. Various results of our experiments demonstrate that our benchmark is well-suited for evaluating social skills in LLMs."}

At test time, Elastic Reasoning prioritize that completeness of solution segments, significantly improving reliability under tight resource constraints. To train models that are robust to truncated thinking, we introduce a lightweight budget-constrained rollout strategy, integrated into GRPO, which teaches the model to reason adaptively when the thinking process is cut short and generalizes effectively to unseen budget constraints without additional training. Empirical results on mathematical (AIME, MATH500) and programming (LiveCodeBench, Codeforces) benchmarks demonstrate that Elastic Reasoning performs robustly under strict budget constraints, while incurring significantly lower training cost than baseline methods.

The robustness of these watermarking algorithms has become a key factor in evaluating their effectiveness. Current text watermarking algorithms embed watermarks in high-entropy tokens to ensure text quality. In this paper, we reveal that this seemingly benign design can be exploited by attackers, posing a significant risk to the robustness of the watermark. We introduce a generic efficient paraphrasing attack, the Self-Information Rewrite Attack (SIRA), which leverages the vulnerability by calculating the self-information of each token to identify potential pattern tokens and perform targeted attack. Our work exposes a widely prevalent vulnerability in current watermarking algorithms. The experimental results show SIRA achieves nearly 100% attack success rates on seven recent watermarking methods with only 0.88 USD per million tokens cost. Our approach does not require any access to the watermark algorithms or the watermarked LLM and can seamlessly transfer to any LLM as the attack model, even mobile-level models.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for prompt-based recommendation due to their ability to generate personalized outputs without task-specific training. However, LLM-based methods face limitations such as limited context window size, inefficient pointwise and pairwise prompting, and difficulty handling listwise ranking due to token constraints. LLMs can also be sensitive to position bias, as they may overemphasize earlier items in the prompt regardless of their true relevance. To address and investigate these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that combines a traditional recommendation model with an LLM for reranking top-k items using structured prompts. We evaluate the effects of user history reordering and instructional prompts for mitigating position bias. Experiments on MovieLens-100K show that randomizing user history improves ranking quality, but LLM-based reranking does not outperform the base model. Explicit instructions to reduce position bias are also ineffective. Our evaluations reveal limitations in LLMs' ability to model ranking context and mitigate bias.

As research advances, multimodal reasoning has rapidly evolved from modular, perception-driven pipelines to unified, language-centric frameworks that offer more coherent cross-modal understanding.

In this work, we introduce a confidence-guided perspective to explain the emergence of redundant reflection in LRMs, identifying two key patterns: Confidence Deficit, where the model reconsiders correct steps due to low internal confidence, and Termination Delay, where reasoning continues even after reaching a confident answer. Based on this analysis, we propose ConCISE (Confidence-guided Compression In Step-by-step Efficient Reasoning), a framework that simplifies reasoning chains by reinforcing the model's confidence during inference, thus preventing the generation of redundant reflection steps. It integrates Confidence Injection to stabilize intermediate steps and Early Stopping to terminate reasoning when confidence is sufficient.

First, we use a toy experiment to study how data composition affects the geometry of features in the representation space. Next, through controlled experiments with Olmo-1B models trained on varying ratios of clean and toxic data, we find that the concept of toxicity enjoys a less entangled linear representation as the proportion of toxic data increases. Furthermore, we show that although toxic data increases the generational toxicity of the base model, it also makes the toxicity easier to remove. Evaluations on Toxigen and Real Toxicity Prompts demonstrate that models trained on toxic data achieve a better trade-off between reducing generational toxicity and preserving general capabilities when detoxifying techniques such as inference-time intervention (ITI) are applied.
