While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology."}

Rasgon, Yide Hao, Junyuan Hong, Ying Ding', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15994', 'abstract': 'Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.'}

These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.'}

However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL this http URL input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows."}

Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education."}
