# Socratic RL: A Novel Framework for Efficient Knowledge Acquisition through Iterative Reflection and Viewpoint Distillation 

**Authors**: Xiangfan Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13358)  

**Abstract**: Current Reinforcement Learning (RL) methodologies for Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on simplistic, outcome-based reward signals (e.g., final answer correctness), which limits the depth of learning from each interaction. This paper introduces Socratic Reinforcement Learning (Socratic-RL), a novel, process-oriented framework designed to address this limitation. Socratic-RL operates on the principle that deeper understanding is achieved by reflecting on the causal reasons for errors and successes within the reasoning process itself. The framework employs a decoupled "Teacher-Student" architecture, where a "Teacher AI" analyzes interaction histories, extracts causal insights, and formulates them into structured "viewpoints." These viewpoints, acting as distilled guidance, are then used by a "Student AI" to enhance its subsequent reasoning. A key innovation is the iterative self-improvement of the Teacher AI, enabling its reflective capabilities to evolve through a meta-learning loop. To manage the accumulation of knowledge, a distillation mechanism compresses learned viewpoints into the Student's parameters. By focusing on process rather than just outcome, Socratic-RL presents a pathway toward enhanced sample efficiency, superior interpretability, and a more scalable architecture for self-improving AI systems. This paper details the foundational concepts, formal mechanisms, synergies, challenges, and a concrete research roadmap for this proposed framework.

# Metis-RISE: RL Incentivizes and SFT Enhances Multimodal Reasoning Model Learning 

**Authors**: Haibo Qiu, Xiaohan Lan, Fanfan Liu, Xiaohu Sun, Delian Ruan, Peng Shi, Lin Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13056)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have witnessed a surge in the development of advanced reasoning paradigms, which are now being integrated into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches often fall short: methods solely employing reinforcement learning (RL) can struggle with sample inefficiency and activating entirely absent reasoning capabilities, while conventional pipelines that initiate with a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase before RL may restrict the model's exploratory capacity and face suboptimal convergence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Metis-RISE} (\textbf{R}L \textbf{I}ncentivizes and \textbf{S}FT \textbf{E}nhances) for multimodal reasoning model learning. Unlike conventional approaches, Metis-RISE distinctively omits an initial SFT stage, beginning instead with an RL phase (e.g., using a Group Relative Policy Optimization variant) to incentivize and activate the model's latent reasoning capacity. Subsequently, the targeted SFT stage addresses two key challenges identified during RL: (1) \textit{inefficient trajectory sampling} for tasks where the model possesses but inconsistently applies correct reasoning, which we tackle using self-distilled reasoning trajectories from the RL model itself; and (2) \textit{fundamental capability absence}, which we address by injecting expert-augmented knowledge for prompts where the model entirely fails. This strategic application of RL for incentivization followed by SFT for enhancement forms the core of Metis-RISE, leading to two versions of our MLLMs (7B and 72B parameters). Evaluations on the OpenCompass Multimodal Reasoning Leaderboard demonstrate that both models achieve state-of-the-art performance among similar-sized models, with the 72B version ranking fourth overall.

# MM-R5: MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval 

**Authors**: Mingjun Xu, Jinhan Dong, Jue Hou, Zehui Wang, Sihang Li, Zhifeng Gao, Renxin Zhong, Hengxing Cai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12364)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal document retrieval systems enable information access across text, images, and layouts, benefiting various domains like document-based question answering, report analysis, and interactive content summarization. Rerankers improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved candidates. However, current multimodal reranking methods remain underexplored, with significant room for improvement in both training strategies and overall effectiveness. Moreover, the lack of explicit reasoning makes it difficult to analyze and optimize these methods further. In this paper, We propose MM-R5, a MultiModal Reasoning-Enhanced ReRanker via Reinforcement Learning for Document Retrieval, aiming to provide a more effective and reliable solution for multimodal reranking tasks. MM-R5 is trained in two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we focus on improving instruction-following and guiding the model to generate complete and high-quality reasoning chains. To support this, we introduce a novel data construction strategy that produces rich, high-quality reasoning data. In the RL stage, we design a task-specific reward framework, including a reranking reward tailored for multimodal candidates and a composite template-based reward to further refine reasoning quality. We conduct extensive experiments on MMDocIR, a challenging public benchmark spanning multiple domains. MM-R5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on most metrics and delivers comparable results to much larger models on the remaining ones. Moreover, compared to the best retrieval-only method, MM-R5 improves recall@1 by over 4%. These results validate the effectiveness of our reasoning-enhanced training pipeline.

# Evaluating Large Language Models for Phishing Detection, Self-Consistency, Faithfulness, and Explainability 

**Authors**: Shova Kuikel, Aritran Piplai, Palvi Aggarwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13746)  

**Abstract**: Phishing attacks remain one of the most prevalent and persistent cybersecurity threat with attackers continuously evolving and intensifying tactics to evade the general detection system. Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, faithfully reproducing the interpretable reasoning with classification and explainability that underpin phishing judgments remains challenging. Due to recent advancement in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) show a promising direction and potential for improving domain specific phishing classification tasks. However, enhancing the reliability and robustness of classification models requires not only accurate predictions from LLMs but also consistent and trustworthy explanations aligning with those predictions. Therefore, a key question remains: can LLMs not only classify phishing emails accurately but also generate explanations that are reliably aligned with their predictions and internally self-consistent? To answer these questions, we have fine-tuned transformer based models, including BERT, Llama models, and Wizard, to improve domain relevance and make them more tailored to phishing specific distinctions, using Binary Sequence Classification, Contrastive Learning (CL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To that end, we examined their performance in phishing classification and explainability by applying the ConsistenCy measure based on SHAPley values (CC SHAP), which measures prediction explanation token alignment to test the model's internal faithfulness and consistency and uncover the rationale behind its predictions and reasoning. Overall, our findings show that Llama models exhibit stronger prediction explanation token alignment with higher CC SHAP scores despite lacking reliable decision making accuracy, whereas Wizard achieves better prediction accuracy but lower CC SHAP scores.

# TimeMaster: Training Time-Series Multimodal LLMs to Reason via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Junru Zhang, Lang Feng, Xu Guo, Yuhan Wu, Yabo Dong, Duanqing Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13705)  

**Abstract**: Time-series reasoning remains a significant challenge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to the dynamic temporal patterns, ambiguous semantics, and lack of temporal priors. In this work, we introduce TimeMaster, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method that enables time-series MLLMs to perform structured, interpretable reasoning directly over visualized time-series inputs and task prompts. TimeMaster adopts a three-part structured output format, reasoning, classification, and domain-specific extension, and is optimized via a composite reward function that aligns format adherence, prediction accuracy, and open-ended insight quality. The model is trained using a two-stage pipeline: we first apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to establish a good initialization, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) at the token level to enable stable and targeted reward-driven improvement in time-series reasoning. We evaluate TimeMaster on the TimerBed benchmark across six real-world classification tasks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct. TimeMaster achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both classical time-series models and few-shot GPT-4o by over 14.6% and 7.3% performance gain, respectively. Notably, TimeMaster goes beyond time-series classification: it also exhibits expert-like reasoning behavior, generates context-aware explanations, and delivers domain-aligned insights. Our results highlight that reward-driven RL can be a scalable and promising path toward integrating temporal understanding into time-series MLLMs.

# CAMS: A CityGPT-Powered Agentic Framework for Urban Human Mobility Simulation 

**Authors**: Yuwei Du, Jie Feng, Jian Yuan, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13599)  

**Abstract**: Human mobility simulation plays a crucial role in various real-world applications. Recently, to address the limitations of traditional data-driven approaches, researchers have explored leveraging the commonsense knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to accelerate human mobility simulation. However, these methods suffer from several critical shortcomings, including inadequate modeling of urban spaces and poor integration with both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility distributions. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{C}ityGPT-Powered \textbf{A}gentic framework for \textbf{M}obility \textbf{S}imulation (\textbf{CAMS}), an agentic framework that leverages the language based urban foundation model to simulate human mobility in urban space. \textbf{CAMS} comprises three core modules, including MobExtractor to extract template mobility patterns and synthesize new ones based on user profiles, GeoGenerator to generate anchor points considering collective knowledge and generate candidate urban geospatial knowledge using an enhanced version of CityGPT, TrajEnhancer to retrieve spatial knowledge based on mobility patterns and generate trajectories with real trajectory preference alignment via DPO. Experiments on real-world datasets show that \textbf{CAMS} achieves superior performance without relying on externally provided geospatial information. Moreover, by holistically modeling both individual mobility patterns and collective mobility constraints, \textbf{CAMS} generates more realistic and plausible trajectories. In general, \textbf{CAMS} establishes a new paradigm that integrates the agentic framework with urban-knowledgeable LLMs for human mobility simulation.

# Direct Reasoning Optimization: LLMs Can Reward And Refine Their Own Reasoning for Open-Ended Tasks 

**Authors**: Yifei Xu, Tusher Chakraborty, Srinagesh Sharma, Leonardo Nunes, Emre Kıcıman, Songwu Lu, Ranveer Chandra  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13351)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased impressive reasoning abilities in structured tasks like mathematics and programming, largely driven by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses outcome-based signals that are scalable, effective, and robust against reward hacking. However, applying similar techniques to open-ended long-form reasoning tasks remains challenging due to the absence of generic, verifiable reward signals. To address this, we propose Direct Reasoning Optimization (DRO), a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning LLMs on open-ended, particularly long-form, reasoning tasks, guided by a new reward signal: the Reasoning Reflection Reward (R3). At its core, R3 selectively identifies and emphasizes key tokens in the reference outcome that reflect the influence of the model's preceding chain-of-thought reasoning, thereby capturing the consistency between reasoning and reference outcome at a fine-grained level. Crucially, R3 is computed internally using the same model being optimized, enabling a fully self-contained training setup. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic data filtering strategy based on R3 for open-ended reasoning tasks, reducing cost while improving downstream performance. We evaluate DRO on two diverse datasets -- ParaRev, a long-form paragraph revision task, and FinQA, a math-oriented QA benchmark -- and show that it consistently outperforms strong baselines while remaining broadly applicable across both open-ended and structured domains.

# AceReason-Nemotron 1.1: Advancing Math and Code Reasoning through SFT and RL Synergy 

**Authors**: Zihan Liu, Zhuolin Yang, Yang Chen, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13284)  

**Abstract**: In this work, we investigate the synergy between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in developing strong reasoning models. We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe. We release the model and data at: this https URL

# Theoretical Tensions in RLHF: Reconciling Empirical Success with Inconsistencies in Social Choice Theory 

**Authors**: Jiancong Xiao, Zhekun Shi, Kaizhao Liu, Qi Long, Weijie J. Su  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12350)  

**Abstract**: Despite its empirical success, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been shown to violate almost all the fundamental axioms in social choice theory -- such as majority consistency, pairwise majority consistency, and Condorcet consistency. This raises a foundational question: why does RLHF perform so well in practice if it fails these seemingly essential properties? In this paper, we resolve this paradox by showing that under mild and empirically plausible assumptions on the preference profile, RLHF does satisfy pairwise majority and Condorcet consistency. These assumptions are frequently satisfied in real-world alignment tasks, offering a theoretical explanation for RLHF's strong practical performance. Furthermore, we show that a slight modification to the reward modeling objective can ensure pairwise majority or Condorcet consistency even under general preference profiles, thereby improving the alignment process. Finally, we go beyond classical axioms in economic and social choice theory and introduce new alignment criteria -- preference matching, preference equivalence, and group preference matching -- that better reflect the goal of learning distributions over responses. We show that while RLHF satisfies the first two properties, it fails to satisfy the third. We conclude by discussing how future alignment methods may be designed to satisfy all three.

# Med-U1: Incentivizing Unified Medical Reasoning in LLMs via Large-scale Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Xiaotian Zhang, Yuan Wang, Zhaopeng Feng, Ruizhe Chen, Zhijie Zhou, Yan Zhang, Hongxia Xu, Jian Wu, Zuozhu Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12307)  

**Abstract**: Medical Question-Answering (QA) encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including multiple choice questions (MCQ), open-ended text generation, and complex computational reasoning. Despite this variety, a unified framework for delivering high-quality medical QA has yet to emerge. Although recent progress in reasoning-augmented large language models (LLMs) has shown promise, their ability to achieve comprehensive medical understanding is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we present Med-U1, a unified framework for robust reasoning across medical QA tasks with diverse output formats, ranging from MCQs to complex generation and computation tasks. Med-U1 employs pure large-scale reinforcement learning with mixed rule-based binary reward functions, incorporating a length penalty to manage output verbosity. With multi-objective reward optimization, Med-U1 directs LLMs to produce concise and verifiable reasoning chains. Empirical results reveal that Med-U1 significantly improves performance across multiple challenging Med-QA benchmarks, surpassing even larger specialized and proprietary models. Furthermore, Med-U1 demonstrates robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. Extensive analysis presents insights into training strategies, reasoning chain length control, and reward design for medical LLMs. The code will be released.

# From Emergence to Control: Probing and Modulating Self-Reflection in Language Models 

**Authors**: Xudong Zhu, Jiachen Jiang, Mohammad Mahdi Khalili, Zhihui Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12217)  

**Abstract**: Self-reflection -- the ability of a large language model (LLM) to revisit, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning -- has recently emerged as a powerful behavior enabled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). While self-reflection correlates with improved reasoning accuracy, its origin and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, {\it we first show that self-reflection is not exclusive to RLVR fine-tuned models: it already emerges, albeit rarely, in pretrained models}. To probe this latent ability, we introduce Reflection-Inducing Probing, a method that injects reflection-triggering reasoning traces from fine-tuned models into pretrained models. This intervention raises self-reflection frequency of Qwen2.5 from 0.6\% to 18.6\%, revealing a hidden capacity for reflection. Moreover, our analysis of internal representations shows that both pretrained and fine-tuned models maintain hidden states that distinctly separate self-reflective from non-reflective contexts. Leveraging this observation, {\it we then construct a self-reflection vector, a direction in activation space associated with self-reflective reasoning}. By manipulating this vector, we enable bidirectional control over the self-reflective behavior for both pretrained and fine-tuned models. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that enhancing these vectors improves reasoning performance by up to 12\%, while suppressing them reduces computational cost, providing a flexible mechanism to navigate the trade-off between reasoning quality and efficiency without requiring additional training. Our findings further our understanding of self-reflection and support a growing body of work showing that understanding model internals can enable precise behavioral control.

**Authors**: MiniMax, Aili Chen, Aonian Li, Bangwei Gong, Binyang Jiang, Bo Fei, Bo Yang, Boji Shan, Changqing Yu, Chao Wang, Cheng Zhu, Chengjun Xiao, Chengyu Du, Chi Zhang, Chu Qiao, Chunhao Zhang, Chunhui Du, Congchao Guo, Da Chen, Deming Ding, Dianjun Sun, Dong Li, Enwei Jiao, Haigang Zhou, Haimo Zhang, Han Ding, Haohai Sun, Haoyu Feng, Huaiguang Cai, Haichao Zhu, Jian Sun, Jiaqi Zhuang, Jiaren Cai, Jiayuan Song, Jin Zhu, Jingyang Li, Jinhao Tian, Jinli Liu, Junhao Xu, Junjie Yan, Junteng Liu, Junxian He, Kaiyi Feng, Ke Yang, Kecheng Xiao, Le Han, Leyang Wang, Lianfei Yu, Liheng Feng, Lin Li, Lin Zheng, Linge Du, Lingyu Yang, Lunbin Zeng, Minghui Yu, Mingliang Tao, Mingyuan Chi, Mozhi Zhang, Mujie Lin, Nan Hu, Nongyu Di, Peng Gao, Pengfei Li, Pengyu Zhao, Qibing Ren, Qidi Xu, Qile Li, Qin Wang, Rong Tian, Ruitao Leng, Shaoxiang Chen, Shaoyu Chen, Shengmin Shi, Shitong Weng, Shuchang Guan, Shuqi Yu, Sichen Li, Songquan Zhu, Tengfei Li, Tianchi Cai, Tianrun Liang, Weiyu Cheng, Weize Kong, Wenkai Li, Xiancai Chen, Xiangjun Song, Xiao Luo, Xiao Su, Xiaobo Li, Xiaodong Han, Xinzhu Hou, Xuan Lu, Xun Zou, Xuyang Shen, Yan Gong, Yan Ma, Yang Wang, Yiqi Shi, Yiran Zhong, Yonghong Duan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13585)  

**Abstract**: We introduce MiniMax-M1, the world's first open-weight, large-scale hybrid-attention reasoning model. MiniMax-M1 is powered by a hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture combined with a lightning attention mechanism. The model is developed based on our previous MiniMax-Text-01 model, which contains a total of 456 billion parameters with 45.9 billion parameters activated per token. The M1 model natively supports a context length of 1 million tokens, 8x the context size of DeepSeek R1. Furthermore, the lightning attention mechanism in MiniMax-M1 enables efficient scaling of test-time compute. These properties make M1 particularly suitable for complex tasks that require processing long inputs and thinking extensively. MiniMax-M1 is trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) on diverse problems including sandbox-based, real-world software engineering environments. In addition to M1's inherent efficiency advantage for RL training, we propose CISPO, a novel RL algorithm to further enhance RL efficiency. CISPO clips importance sampling weights rather than token updates, outperforming other competitive RL variants. Combining hybrid-attention and CISPO enables MiniMax-M1's full RL training on 512 H800 GPUs to complete in only three weeks, with a rental cost of just $534,700. We release two versions of MiniMax-M1 models with 40K and 80K thinking budgets respectively, where the 40K model represents an intermediate phase of the 80K training. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our models are comparable or superior to strong open-weight models such as the original DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B, with particular strengths in complex software engineering, tool utilization, and long-context tasks. We publicly release MiniMax-M1 at this https URL.

# BOW: Bottlenecked Next Word Exploration 

**Authors**: Ming Shen, Zhikun Xu, Xiao Ye, Jacob Dineen, Ben Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13502)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained via next-word prediction (NWP), which provides strong surface-level fluency but often lacks support for robust reasoning. We propose BOttlenecked next Word exploration (BOW), a novel RL framework that rethinks NWP by introducing a reasoning bottleneck where a policy model first generates a reasoning path rather than predicting the next token directly, after which a frozen judge model predicts the next token distribution based solely on this reasoning path. We train the policy model using GRPO with rewards that quantify how effectively the reasoning path facilitates next-word recovery. Compared with other continual pretraining baselines, we show that BOW improves both the general and next-word reasoning capabilities of the base model, evaluated on various benchmarks. Our findings show that BOW can serve as an effective and scalable alternative to vanilla NWP.

# Efficient Medical VIE via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Lijun Liu, Ruiyang Li, Zhaocheng Liu, Chenglin Zhu, Chong Li, Jiehan Cheng, Qiang Ju, Jian Xie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13363)  

**Abstract**: Visual Information Extraction (VIE) converts unstructured document images into structured formats like JSON, critical for medical applications such as report analysis and online consultations. Traditional methods rely on OCR and language models, while end-to-end multimodal models offer direct JSON generation. However, domain-specific schemas and high annotation costs limit their effectiveness in medical VIE. We base our approach on the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) framework to address these challenges using only 100 annotated samples. Our approach ensures dataset diversity, a balanced precision-recall reward mechanism to reduce hallucinations and improve field coverage, and innovative sampling strategies to enhance reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our RLVR method, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on medical VIE tasks, significantly improving F1, precision, and recall. While our models excel on tasks similar to medical datasets, performance drops on dissimilar tasks, highlighting the need for domain-specific optimization. Case studies further demonstrate the value of reasoning during training and inference for VIE.

# FinLMM-R1: Enhancing Financial Reasoning in LMM through Scalable Data and Reward Design 

**Authors**: Kai Lan, Jiayong Zhu, Jiangtong Li, Dawei Cheng, Guang Chen, Changjun Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.13066)  

**Abstract**: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) demonstrate significant cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, financial applications face challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets and the inefficiency of existing training paradigms for reasoning enhancement. To address these issues, we propose an integrated framework, FinLMM-R1, combining an automated and scalable pipeline for data construction with enhanced training strategies to improve the multimodal reasoning of LMM. The Automated and Scalable Pipeline (ASP) resolves textual-visual misalignment in financial reports through a separate paradigm of question-answer generation and image-question alignment, ensuring data integrity and extraction efficiency. Through ASP, we collect 89,378 aligned image-question pairs from 23,397 financial reports, covering tasks such as arithmetic reasoning, statistics reasoning, financial explanation, and financial knowledge. Moreover, we introduce the Thinking with Adversarial Reward in LMM (TAR-LMM), extending the prior two-stage training framework [1] with additional reward mechanisms. In the first stage, we focus on text-only tasks with format and accuracy rewards to guide the model in generating well-structured thinking contents. In the second stage, we construct multi-image contrastive samples with additional reward components including image selection, thinking content length, and adversarial reward to jointly optimize the LMM across visual perception, reasoning efficiency, and logical coherence. Extensive experiments on 7 benchmarks show ASP-derived dataset and training framework significantly improve answer accuracy and reasoning depth over existing reasoning LMMs in both general and financial multimodal contexts.

# SoundMind: RL-Incentivized Logic Reasoning for Audio-Language Models 

**Authors**: Xingjian Diao, Chunhui Zhang, Keyi Kong, Weiyi Wu, Chiyu Ma, Zhongyu Ouyang, Peijun Qing, Soroush Vosoughi, Jiang Gui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12935)  

**Abstract**: While large language models have shown reasoning capabilities, their application to the audio modality, particularly in large audio-language models (ALMs), remains significantly underdeveloped. Addressing this gap requires a systematic approach, involving a capable base model, high-quality reasoning-oriented audio data, and effective training algorithms. In this study, we present a comprehensive solution: we introduce the Audio Logical Reasoning (ALR) dataset, consisting of 6,446 text-audio annotated samples specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. Building on this resource, we propose SoundMind, a rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm tailored to endow ALMs with deep bimodal reasoning abilities. By training Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on the ALR dataset using SoundMind, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio logical reasoning. This work highlights the impact of combining high-quality, reasoning-focused datasets with specialized RL techniques, advancing the frontier of auditory intelligence in language models. Our code and the proposed dataset are available at this https URL.

# Detection, Classification, and Mitigation of Gender Bias in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Xiaoqing Cheng, Hongying Zan, Lulu Kong, Jinwang Song, Min Peng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12527)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), they have significantly improved efficiency across a wide range of domains. However, recent studies have revealed that LLMs often exhibit gender bias, leading to serious social implications. Detecting, classifying, and mitigating gender bias in LLMs has therefore become a critical research focus. In the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7: Chinese Corpus for Gender Bias Detection, Classification and Mitigation Challenge, we investigate how to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in gender bias detection, classification, and mitigation. We adopt reinforcement learning, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning, and supervised fine-tuning to handle different Subtasks. Specifically, for Subtasks 1 and 2, we leverage the internal reasoning capabilities of LLMs to guide multi-step thinking in a staged manner, which simplifies complex biased queries and improves response accuracy. For Subtask 3, we employ a reinforcement learning-based approach, annotating a preference dataset using GPT-4. We then apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate gender bias by introducing a loss function that explicitly favors less biased completions over biased ones. Our approach ranked first across all three subtasks of the NLPCC 2025 Shared Task 7.

# From Outcomes to Processes: Guiding PRM Learning from ORM for Inference-Time Alignment 

**Authors**: Bin Xie, Bingbing Xu, Yige Yuan, Shengmao Zhu, Huawei Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12446)  

**Abstract**: Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches using reward-guided search (RGS) primarily rely on outcome reward models (ORMs), which suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: ORMs are designed to provide outcome rewards for complete responses, while RGS methods rely on process rewards to guide the policy, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To address this challenge, we introduce process reward models (PRMs) into RGS and argue that an ideal PRM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. Based on these, we propose SP-PRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules without relying on human annotation. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that SP-PRM substantially enhances existing RGS methods, achieving a 3.6%-10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.
