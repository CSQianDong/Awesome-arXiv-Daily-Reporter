However, compared to the rapid developments in the AI community, recommendation systems have not achieved a breakthrough in recent years. For instance, they still rely on a multi-stage cascaded architecture rather than an end-to-end approach, leading to computational fragmentation and optimization inconsistencies, and hindering the effective application of key breakthrough technologies from the AI community in recommendation scenarios.\nTo address these issues, we propose OneRec, which reshapes the recommendation system through an end-to-end generative approach and achieves promising results. Firstly, we have enhanced the computational FLOPs of the current recommendation model by 10 $\\times$ and have identified the scaling laws for recommendations within certain boundaries. Secondly, reinforcement learning techniques, previously difficult to apply for optimizing recommendations, show significant potential in this framework. Lastly, through infrastructure optimizations, we have achieved 23.7% and 28.8% Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) on flagship GPUs during training and inference, respectively, aligning closely with the LLM community. This architecture significantly reduces communication and storage overhead, resulting in operating expense that is only 10.6% of traditional recommendation pipelines. Deployed in Kuaishou/Kuaishou Lite APP, it handles 25% of total queries per second, enhancing overall App Stay Time by 0.54% and 1.24%, respectively. Additionally, we have observed significant increases in metrics such as 7-day Lifetime, which is a crucial indicator of recommendation experience. We also provide practical lessons and insights derived from developing, optimizing, and maintaining a production-scale recommendation system with significant real-world impact.'}

To address this, we propose a hierarchical clustering-based retrieval method that eliminates the need to predefine k. Our approach maintains the accuracy and relevance of system responses while adaptively selecting semantically relevant content. In the experiment stage, we applied our method to a Taiwanese legal dataset with expert-graded queries. The results show that our approach achieves superior performance in expert evaluations and maintains high precision while eliminating the need to predefine k, demonstrating improved accuracy and interpretability in legal text retrieval tasks. Our framework is simple to implement and easily integrates with existing RAG pipelines, making it a practical solution for real-world applications under limited resources.'}

By approximating the dot-product attention, linear attention provides an efficient option with linear complexity. However, existing linear attention methods face two limitations: 1) they often use learnable position encodings, which incur extra computational costs in long-term sequence scenarios, and 2) they may not consider the user's fine-grained local preferences and confuse these with the actual change of long-term interests. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a long-term sequential Recommendation model with Gated Rotary Enhanced Linear Attention (RecGRELA). Specifically, we first propose a Rotary-Enhanced Linear Attention (RELA) module to model long-range dependency within the user's historical information using rotary position encodings. We then introduce a local short operation to incorporate local preferences and demonstrate the theoretical insight. We further introduce a SiLU-based Gated mechanism for RELA (GRELA) to help the model determine whether a user's behavior indicates local interest or a genuine shift in long-term preferences. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that our RecGRELA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing SRSs while maintaining low memory overhead."}

We introduce an AI-powered method for identifying news articles based on an event FINGERPRINT, which is a minimal set of metadata required to identify critical events. Our event coverage identification method, FINGERPRINT TO ARTICLE MATCHING FOR EVENTS (FAME), efficiently identifies news articles about critical world events, specifically terrorist attacks and several types of natural disasters. FAME does not require training data and is able to automatically and efficiently identify news articles that discuss an event given its fingerprint: time, location, and class (such as storm or flood). The method achieves state-of-the-art performance and scales to massive databases of tens of millions of news articles and hundreds of events happening globally. We use FAME to identify 27,441 articles that cover 470 natural disaster and terrorist attack events that happened in 2020. To this end, we use a massive database of news articles in three languages from MediaCloud, and three widely used, expert-curated databases of critical events: EM-DAT, USGS, and GTD. Our case study reveals patterns consistent with prior literature: coverage of disasters and terrorist attacks correlates to death counts, to the GDP of a country where the event occurs, and to trade volume between the reporting country and the country where the event occurred.

While this shift aligns training more closely with serving goals, most existing methods rely on in-batch negative sampling, which predominantly surfaces easy negatives. This limits the model's ability to capture fine-grained user preferences and weakens overall ranking performance. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Group-wise Ranking Framework with two key components. First, we apply residual vector quantization to user embeddings to generate hierarchical user codes that partition users into hierarchical, trie-structured clusters. Second, we apply listwise ranking losses to user-item pairs at each level of the hierarchy, where shallow levels group loosely similar users and deeper levels group highly similar users, reinforcing learning-to-rank signals through progressively harder negatives. Since users with similar preferences and content exposure tend to yield more informative negatives, applying ranking losses within these hierarchical user groups serves as an effective approximation of hard negative mining. Our approach improves ranking performance without requiring complex real-time context collection or retrieval infrastructure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances both model calibration and ranking accuracy, offering a scalable and practical solution for industrial recommender systems."}

Siddique, Hassan Foroosh', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12661', 'abstract': 'The mobile app market has expanded exponentially, offering millions of apps with diverse functionalities, yet research in mobile app recommendation remains limited. Traditional sequential recommender systems utilize the order of items in users\' historical interactions to predict the next item for the users. Position embeddings, well-established in transformer-based architectures for natural language processing tasks, effectively distinguish token positions in sequences. In sequential recommendation systems, position embeddings can capture the order of items in a user\'s historical interaction sequence. Nevertheless, this ordering does not consider the time elapsed between two interactions of the same user (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), referred to as "user rhythm". In mobile app recommendation datasets, the time between consecutive user interactions is notably longer compared to other domains like movies, posing significant challenges for sequential recommender systems. To address this phenomenon in the mobile app domain, we introduce INTERPOS, an Interaction Rhythm Guided Positional Morphing strategy for autoregressive mobile app recommender systems. INTERPOS incorporates rhythm-guided position embeddings, providing a more comprehensive representation that considers both the sequential order of interactions and the temporal gaps between them. This approach enables a deep understanding of users\' rhythms at a fine-grained level, capturing the intricacies of their interaction patterns over time. We propose three strategies to incorporate the morphed positional embeddings in two transformer-based sequential recommendation system architectures.

To handle the formulated non-convex problem, a gradient-based meta-learning joint optimization (GML-JO) algorithm is proposed. Specifically, the original problem is initially decomposed into two sub-problems of beamforming optimization and antenna position optimization through equivalent substitution. Then, the convex approximation methods are used to deal with the nonconvex constraints of sub-problems, and two sub-neural networks are constructed to calculate the sub-problems separately. Different from alternating optimization (AO), where two sub-problems are solved alternately and the solutions are influenced by the initial values, two sub-neural networks of proposed GML-JO with fixed channel coefficients are considered as local sub-tasks and the computation results are used to calculate the loss function of joint optimization. Finally, the parameters of sub-networks are updated using the average loss function over different sub-tasks and the solution that is robust to the initial value is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GML-JO algorithm achieves 5.6 bits/s/Hz WSR within 100 iterations, yielding a 32.7\\% performance enhancement over conventional AO with substantially reduced computational complexity. Moreover, the proposed GML-JO algorithm is robust to different choices of initialization and yields better performance compared with the existing optimization methods.'}

We have developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph. We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas the hybrid model offered balanced performance.

In addition, it offers a clear justification for why a piece of information received that score. Evaluated using prompt engineering, WebTrust consistently achieves superior performance compared to other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches, outperforming them across all experiments on MAE, RMSE, and R2.

A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an 8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and (3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology.

Understanding when lexical or semantic models are more effective at handling the repetitive nature of legal language is key to developing retrieval systems that are more accurate, efficient, and transparent for specific legal domains. To this end, we explore when this routinized legal language is better suited for retrieval using methods that rely on lexical and statistical features, such as BM25, or dense retrieval models trained to capture semantic and contextual information. A qualitative and quantitative analysis with three complementary metrics shows that both lexical and dense models perform well in scenarios with more repetitive usage of language, whereas BM25 performs better than the dense models in more nuanced scenarios where repetition and verbatim~quotes are less prevalent and in longer queries. Our experiments also show that BM25 is a strong baseline, surpassing off-the-shelf dense models in 4 out of 7 performance metrics. However, fine-tuning a dense model on domain-specific data led to improved performance, surpassing BM25 in most metrics, and we analyze the effect of the amount of data used in fine-tuning on the model's performance and temporal robustness.

In response, we present VeLoPIR, a versatile location-based private information retrieval (PIR) system designed to preserve user privacy while enabling efficient and scalable query processing. VeLoPIR introduces three operational modes-interval validation, coordinate validation, and identifier matching-that support a broad range of real-world applications, including information and emergency alerts. To enhance performance, VeLoPIR incorporates multi-level algorithmic optimizations with parallel structures, achieving significant scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. We also provide formal security and privacy proofs, confirming the system's robustness under standard cryptographic assumptions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that VeLoPIR achieves up to 11.55 times speed-up over a prior baseline. The implementation of VeLoPIR is publicly available at this https URL."}

However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope, a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11 computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall, SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools."}

Traditional RAG pipelines often suffer from high latency and limited accuracy over massive, diverse datasets. DoTA-RAG addresses these challenges with a three-stage pipeline: query rewriting, dynamic routing to specialized sub-indexes, and multi-stage retrieval and ranking. We further enhance retrieval by evaluating and selecting a superior embedding model, re-embedding the large FineWeb-10BT corpus. Moreover, we create a diverse Q&A dataset of 500 questions generated via the DataMorgana setup across a broad range of WebOrganizer topics and formats. DoTA-RAG improves the answer correctness score from 0.752 (baseline, using LiveRAG pre-built vector store) to 1.478 while maintaining low latency, and it achieves a 0.929 correctness score on the Live Challenge Day. These results highlight DoTA-RAG's potential for practical deployment in domains requiring fast, reliable access to large and evolving knowledge sources."}
