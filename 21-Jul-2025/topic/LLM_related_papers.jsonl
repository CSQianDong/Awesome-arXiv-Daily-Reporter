However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis."}

However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\nMethods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.\nResults: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.\nConclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.'}

Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.\nWe present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.\nWe evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes.

The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.'}

A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives.

Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness.

While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.'}

In this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing significant improvement.

Compared to traditional methods such as collaborative filtering, LLM-based recommendation offers advantages in handling cold-start, cross-domain, and zero-shot scenarios, as well as supporting flexible input formats and generating explanations of user behavior. In this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from other users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or data-limited applications. In such cases, prompt engineering becomes especially important for controlling the output generated by the LLM. We conduct a large-scale comparison of 23 prompt types across 8 public datasets and 12 LLMs. We use statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate both accuracy and inference cost. Our results show that for cost-efficient LLMs, three types of prompts are especially effective: those that rephrase instructions, consider background knowledge, and make the reasoning process easier to follow. For high-performance LLMs, simple prompts often outperform more complex ones while reducing cost. In contrast, commonly used prompting styles in natural language processing, such as step-by-step reasoning, or the use of reasoning models often lead to lower accuracy. Based on these findings, we provide practical suggestions for selecting prompts and LLMs depending on the required balance between accuracy and cost.'}

In this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units (DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more faithful and temporal-aware generation.

In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
