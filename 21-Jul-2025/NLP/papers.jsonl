However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.\nMethods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.\nResults: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.\nConclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.'}

Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.\nWe present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.\nWe evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings."}

The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act (CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially aware language agents.'}

Three open datasets of social media are used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS.

Jha', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13966', 'abstract': "Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents."}

However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.'}

This issue is critical in multilingual societies where CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS, widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.

In this work, we present a probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story, and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right. Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which greatly contributes to their poor quality."}

In this paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents."}

Existing methods can be broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted distribution with the true category distribution.

This raises a critical question: To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content? In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models (VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images. Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless, can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.'}

Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of 100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1% additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%. Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements. These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with minimal computation.

We compare models trained on individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x more samples.

Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \\href{this https URL}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.'}

However, high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary. Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model. Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81 percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark."}

Our evaluation across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods. Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU environments.'}

Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to \\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best \\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.'}

The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.'}

Second, it is unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations."}

In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.'}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.'}

Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions. These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However, research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1) Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \\textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA scenarios."}

The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.'}

Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks: Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR) into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking, spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance: LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal (+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for improving compositional video reasoning.'}

Existing VolVis approaches have explored non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness, and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives, extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes, resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and editing flexibility.'}

Yet, those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts. This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications in sensitive domains.'}

Yu', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13396', 'abstract': 'Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However, existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units (DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more faithful and temporal-aware generation.

We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model\'s original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular, we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open source at: this https URL'}
