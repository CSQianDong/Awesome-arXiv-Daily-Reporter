{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2503.22064', 'title': 'Multi-Task Semantic Communications via Large Models', 'authors': 'Wanli Ni, Zhijin Qin, Haofeng Sun, Xiaoming Tao, Zhu Han', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22064', 'abstract': 'Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to revolutionize the design, optimization and management of next-generation communication systems. In this article, we explore the integration of large AI models (LAMs) into semantic communications (SemCom) by leveraging their multi-modal data processing and generation capabilities. Although LAMs bring unprecedented abilities to extract semantics from raw data, this integration entails multifaceted challenges including high resource demands, model complexity, and the need for adaptability across diverse modalities and tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a LAM-based multi-task SemCom (MTSC) architecture, which includes an adaptive model compression strategy and a federated split fine-tuning approach to facilitate the efficient deployment of LAM-based semantic models in resource-limited networks. Furthermore, a retrieval-augmented generation scheme is implemented to synthesize the most recent local and global knowledge bases to enhance the accuracy of semantic extraction and content generation, thereby improving the inference performance. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LAM-based MTSC architecture, highlighting the performance enhancements across various downstream tasks under varying channel conditions.'}

Accurate diagnosis of psychodynamic conflicts is crucial for effective patient treatment and is commonly done via long, manually scored semi-structured interviews. Existing automated solutions for psychiatric diagnosis tend to focus on the recognition of broad disorder categories such as depression, and it is unclear to what extent psychodynamic conflicts which even the patient themselves may not have conscious access to could be automatically recognised from conversation. In this paper, we propose AutoPsyC, the first method for recognising the presence and significance of psychodynamic conflicts from full-length Operationalized Psychodynamic Diagnostics (OPD) interviews using Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach combines recent advances in parameter-efficient fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a summarisation strategy to effectively process entire 90 minute long conversations. In evaluations on a dataset of 141 diagnostic interviews we show that AutoPsyC consistently outperforms all baselines and ablation conditions on the recognition of four highly relevant psychodynamic conflicts."}
