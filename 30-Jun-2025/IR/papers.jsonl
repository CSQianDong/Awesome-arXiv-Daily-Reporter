In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking. Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures, leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities. Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area. Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, Discrimination Learning Enhances Learning Path Recommendation (DLELP), which enhances learning path recommendations by incorporating both prerequisite and similarity relationships between knowledge concepts. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge concept structure graph generation module that adaptively constructs knowledge concept structure graphs for different educational datasets, significantly improving the generalizability of learning path recommendation methods.

Despite these efforts, a critical gap remains: the simultaneous balancing of intrinsic biases in world models and the diversity of policy recommendations. To address this limitation, we present an innovative offline RL framework termed Reallocated Reward for Recommender Systems (R3S).

We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA.

We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on evaluation methodology.

However, ICD codes do not capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis. Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics, demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong potential for broader clinical deployment.'}

Despite the success of task-specific, end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation, which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based, importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.'}

While previous research has primarily focused on locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content, directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question answering performance across diverse document types without requiring architectural modifications or additional training."}

We assess the performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.'}

In this work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes, such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions, evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\\%, $-1.61\\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM calls by 95.82\\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.'}

Though dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68 points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile, several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea. Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W and WFLW testsets without additional cost.'}

However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.'}
