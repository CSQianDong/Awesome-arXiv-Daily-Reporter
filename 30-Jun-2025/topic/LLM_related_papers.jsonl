To evaluate the ability of AI agents to reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time. Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an autonomous research agent.'}

HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid, detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training samples.

Our work investigates how the KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples, Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes samples better, and preserves the model\'s existing knowledge. For negative samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages more concise reasoning while preserving the model\'s explorative capacity. We apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\\% gain over the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning benchmarks.

We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems."}

Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.\nTo this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1) Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes are available at this https URL."}

We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted. With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based modeling for social simulation.'}

Our research addresses this by investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for future LLM development and evaluation."}

In this paper, we define two types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment, while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts."}

To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications. Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing transparent and responsible LLMs."}

Our findings confirm the presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

Notable linguistic patterns in MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70% classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.'}

Consequently, the summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000 annotated TLS instances.

To achieve this, existing methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%) over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent reasoning."}

Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting to consistent responses within groups.

With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL). Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network (GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters will be updated based on few-shot examples.

In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking. Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures, leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities. Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area. Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems."}

The ancient Yellow River culture is, moreover, an indispensable part of human art history. To conserve and inherit the ancient Yellow River culture, we designed RiverEcho, a real-time interactive system that responds to voice queries using a large language model and a cultural knowledge dataset, delivering explanations through a talking-head digital human. Specifically, we built a knowledge database focused on the ancient Yellow River culture, including the collection of historical texts and the processing pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the proposed dataset enhances the response quality of the Large Language Model(LLM), enabling the system to generate more professional and informative responses. Our work not only diversifies the means of promoting Yellow River culture but also provides users with deeper cultural insights."}

While recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness, element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable, interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.'}

We present PentaRAG, a five-layer module that routes each query through two instant caches (fixed key-value and semantic), a memory-recall mode that exploits the LLM's own weights, an adaptive session memory, and a conventional retrieval-augmentation layer. Implemented with Mistral-8B, Milvus and vLLM, the system can answer most repeated or semantically similar questions from low-latency caches while retaining full retrieval for novel queries. On the TriviaQA domain, LoRA fine-tuning combined with the memory-recall layer raises answer similarity by approximately 8% and factual correctness by approximately 16% over the base model. Under a nine-session runtime simulation, cache warming reduces mean latency from several seconds to well below one second and shifts traffic toward the fast paths. Resource-efficiency tests show that PentaRAG cuts average GPU time to 0.248 seconds per query, roughly half that of a naive RAG baseline, and sustains an aggregate throughput of approximately 100,000 queries per second on our setup. These results demonstrate that a layered routing strategy can deliver freshness, speed, and efficiency simultaneously in production-grade RAG systems."}

However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.'}
