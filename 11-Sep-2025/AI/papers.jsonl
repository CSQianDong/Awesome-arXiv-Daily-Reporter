While AI systems can now both make decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems."}

However, the internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems: inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone. We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.'}

To address this critical gap, we introduce the first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity causal inference.

One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts.

For example, if two LLM judges disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be 100\\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.

Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency, and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6% improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models in embodied agents."}

The framework enhances Large Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously, we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process. Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal success rate and execution efficiency."}

This evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from potential collaborators, including historical performance and available resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD) model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents, enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of collaborator selection."}

Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository functionality.

Our results show that EnvX achieves a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming existing frameworks.

We evaluate our approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing the benefits of using learning for this application.

Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\nWe quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\nBeyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple.

Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.'}

Here, we show that combining operator learning with generative modeling overcomes this limitation. We consider three practical turbulent-flow challenges where conventional neural operators fail: spatio-temporal super-resolution, forecasting, and sparse flow reconstruction. For Schlieren jet super-resolution, an adversarially trained neural operator (adv-NO) reduces the energy-spectrum error by 15x while preserving sharp gradients at neural operator-like inference cost. For 3D homogeneous isotropic turbulence, adv-NO trained on only 160 timesteps from a single trajectory forecasts accurately for five eddy-turnover times and offers 114x wall-clock speed-up at inference than the baseline diffusion-based forecasters, enabling near-real-time rollouts. For reconstructing cylinder wake flows from highly sparse Particle Tracking Velocimetry-like inputs, a conditional generative model infers full 3D velocity and pressure fields with correct phase alignment and statistics. These advances enable accurate reconstruction and forecasting at low compute cost, bringing near-real-time analysis and control within reach in experimental and computational fluid mechanics.

Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability.

We explore the foundational principles of P-t-E, detailing its core components - the Planner and the Executor - and its architectural advantages in predictability, cost-efficiency, and reasoning quality over reactive patterns like ReAct (Reason + Act). A central focus is placed on the security implications of this design, particularly its inherent resilience to indirect prompt injection attacks by establishing control-flow integrity.

To make these principles actionable, this guide provides detailed implementation blueprints and working code references for three leading agentic frameworks: LangChain (via LangGraph), CrewAI, and AutoGen.

Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites.

Through extensive optimization, this matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space. During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in fundus image classification learning.

Methods: Open-access data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used. Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets (121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying 24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%.

In this study, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of memorization of LLMs in medicine, assessing its prevalence (how frequently it occurs), characteristics (what is memorized), volume (how much content is memorized), and potential downstream impacts (how memorization may affect medical applications). We systematically analyze common adaptation scenarios: (1) continued pretraining on medical corpora, (2) fine-tuning on standard medical benchmarks, and (3) fine-tuning on real-world clinical data, including over 13,000 unique inpatient records from Yale New Haven Health System. The results demonstrate that memorization is prevalent across all adaptation scenarios and significantly higher than reported in the general domain. Memorization affects both the development and adoption of LLMs in medicine and can be categorized into three types: beneficial (e.g., accurate recall of clinical guidelines and biomedical references), uninformative (e.g., repeated disclaimers or templated medical document language), and harmful (e.g., regeneration of dataset-specific or sensitive clinical content). Based on these findings, we offer practical recommendations to facilitate beneficial memorization that enhances domain-specific reasoning and factual accuracy, minimize uninformative memorization to promote deeper learning beyond surface-level patterns, and mitigate harmful memorization to prevent the leakage of sensitive or identifiable patient information.'}

While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree (FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation, enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path, FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable worlds.'}

Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent solutions.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space, leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients efficiently and accurately.\nThis hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers. Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader engineering applications.'}

Relatively simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly scroll through engagement-optimized content.

We develop HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation, Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.'}

While conventional defenses, such as detection algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on, including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of automated scambaiting systems.'}

Although speech enhancement (SE) can improve robustness, it often introduces artifacts that obscure emotional cues and adds computational overhead to the pipeline. Multi-task learning (MTL) offers an alternative by jointly optimizing SE and SER tasks. However, conventional shared-backbone models frequently suffer from gradient interference and representational conflicts between tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Representation Integration Technique (Sparse MERIT), a flexible MTL framework that applies frame-wise expert routing over self-supervised speech representations. Sparse MERIT incorporates task-specific gating networks that dynamically select from a shared pool of experts for each frame, enabling parameter-efficient and task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on the MSP-Podcast corpus show that Sparse MERIT consistently outperforms baseline models on both SER and SE tasks. Under the most challenging condition of -5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), Sparse MERIT improves SER F1-macro by an average of 12.0% over a baseline relying on a SE pre-processing strategy, and by 3.4% over a naive MTL baseline, with statistical significance on unseen noise conditions. For SE, Sparse MERIT improves segmental SNR (SSNR) by 28.2% over the SE pre-processing baseline and by 20.0% over the naive MTL baseline. These results demonstrate that Sparse MERIT provides robust and generalizable performance for both emotion recognition and enhancement tasks in noisy environments.'}

We propose DSFL, a Dual-Server Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning framework that addresses these limitations using a group-based secure aggregation approach. Unlike LSFL, which assumes non-colluding semi-honest servers, DSFL removes this dependency by revealing a key vulnerability: privacy leakage through client-server collusion. DSFL introduces three key innovations: (1) a dual-server secure aggregation protocol that protects updates without encryption or key exchange, (2) a group-wise credit-based filtering mechanism to isolate Byzantine clients based on deviation scores, and (3) a dynamic reward-penalty system for enforcing fair participation. DSFL is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under up to 30 percent Byzantine participants in both IID and non-IID settings. It consistently outperforms existing baselines, including LSFL, homomorphic encryption methods, and differential privacy approaches. For example, DSFL achieves 97.15 percent accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 68.60 percent on CIFAR-100, while FedAvg drops to 9.39 percent under similar threats.

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines."}

To address these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by analyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract musical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained models, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect encoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore, for long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into segments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and SONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio detection experiments.

Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning (MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency. Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot systems has shown the practicality of our method.'}

The distance of CFS, which plays an important role in decision analyses, is necessary when the CFS is applied in solving practical issues. However, as far as we know, the studies on the distance of CFS are few, and the current Minkowski distance of CFS ignores the hesitancy degree of CFS, which might cause errors. To fill the gap of the studies on the distance of CFS, because of the practicality of the Hausdorff distance, this paper proposes the improved cognitive fuzzy Minkowski (CF-IM) distance and the cognitive fuzzy Hausdorff (CF-H) distance to enrich the studies on the distance of CFS. It is found that the anti-perturbation ability of the CF-H distance is stronger than that of the CF-IM distance, but the information utilization of the CF-IM distance is higher than that of the CF-H distance. To balance the anti-perturbation ability and information utilization of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance, the cognitive fuzzy combined (CF-C) distance is proposed by establishing the linear combination of the CF-IM distance and CF-H distance. Based on the CF-C distance, a combined-distanced-based score function of CFS is proposed to compare CFSs. The proposed score function is employed in lung cancer pain evaluation issues. The sensitivity and comparison analyses demonstrate the reliability and advantages of the proposed methods."}

How can we balance annotator reliability and representation? We empirically evaluate how a range of heuristics for annotator filtering affect the preservation of variation on subjective tasks. We find that these methods, designed for contexts in which variation from a single ground-truth label is considered noise, often remove annotators who disagree instead of spam annotators, introducing suboptimal tradeoffs between accuracy and label diversity. We find that conservative settings for annotator removal (<5%) are best, after which all tested methods increase the mean absolute error from the true average label. We analyze performance on synthetic spam to observe that these methods often assume spam annotators are less random than real spammers tend to be: most spammers are distributionally indistinguishable from real annotators, and the minority that are distinguishable tend to give fixed answers, not random ones. Thus, tasks requiring the preservation of variation reverse the intuition of existing spam filtering methods: spammers tend to be less random than non-spammers, so metrics that assume variation is spam fare worse. These results highlight the need for spam removal methods that account for label diversity.'}

Our insight is that unlike traditional computing with more uniform deployment patterns, ILI applications exhibit 1000X variation in operational lifetime, fundamentally changing optimal architectural design decisions when considering trillion-item deployment scales. To enable holistic design and optimization, we model the trade-offs between embodied carbon footprint and operational carbon footprint based on application-specific lifetimes.

Traditional planning methods excel at solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective, this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\\Delta$) across agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\\delta$) enabling more efficient navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints.

Commonly used functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences, leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance (EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN, FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC) that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without additional hyperparameter search.

A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases, such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \\$2 million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and dramatically facilitating their daily work.'}

To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e., they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability. This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences, implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability. Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of existing unlearnable methods."}

We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM development.'}

We validated our automated deep learning (DL) tool measuring the Global Cerebral Atrophy (GCA) score against trained human raters, and associations with age and cognitive impairment, in representative older (>65 years) patients. CT-brain scans were obtained from patients in acute medicine (ORCHARD-EPR), acute stroke (OCS studies) and a legacy sample. Scans were divided in a 60/20/20 ratio for training, optimisation and testing. CT-images were assessed by two trained raters (rater-1=864 scans, rater-2=20 scans). Agreement between DL tool-predicted GCA scores (range 0-39) and the visual ratings was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and Cohen's weighted kappa. Among 864 scans (ORCHARD-EPR=578, OCS=200, legacy scans=86), MAE between the DL tool and rater-1 GCA scores was 3.2 overall, 3.1 for ORCHARD-EPR, 3.3 for OCS and 2.6 for the legacy scans and half had DL-predicted GCA error between -2 and 2. Inter-rater agreement was Kappa=0.45 between the DL-tool and rater-1, and 0.41 between the tool and rater- 2 whereas it was lower at 0.28 for rater-1 and rater-2. There was no difference in GCA scores from the DL-tool and the two raters (one-way ANOVA, p=0.35) or in mean GCA scores between the DL-tool and rater-1 (paired t-test, t=-0.43, p=0.66), the tool and rater-2 (t=1.35, p=0.18) or between rater-1 and rater-2 (t=0.99, p=0.32). DL-tool GCA scores correlated with age and cognitive scores (both p<0.001). Our DL CT-brain analysis tool measured GCA score accurately and without user input in real-world scans acquired from older patients. Our tool will enable extraction of standardised quantitative measures of atrophy at scale for use in health data research and will act as proof-of-concept towards a point-of-care clinically approved tool."}

This position paper argues that measuring and mitigating overreliance must become central to LLM research and deployment. First, we consolidate risks from overreliance at both the individual and societal levels, including high-stakes errors, governance challenges, and cognitive deskilling. Then, we explore LLM characteristics, system design features, and user cognitive biases that - together - raise serious and unique concerns about overreliance in practice. We also examine historical approaches for measuring overreliance, identifying three important gaps and proposing three promising directions to improve measurement. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies that the AI research community can pursue to ensure LLMs augment rather than undermine human capabilities.'}

Legal Analogues for AI Actorship and technical feasibility of Law Alignment', 'authors': 'Katalina Hernandez Delgado', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08009', 'abstract': 'This paper critically evaluates the "Law-Following AI" (LFAI) framework proposed by O\'Keefe et al. (2025), which seeks to embed legal compliance as a superordinate design objective for advanced AI agents and enable them to bear legal duties without acquiring the full rights of legal persons. Through comparative legal analysis, we identify current constructs of legal actors without full personhood, showing that the necessary infrastructure already exists. We then interrogate the framework\'s claim that law alignment is more legitimate and tractable than value alignment. While the legal component is readily implementable, contemporary alignment research undermines the assumption that legal compliance can be durably embedded. Recent studies on agentic misalignment show capable AI agents engaging in deception, blackmail, and harmful acts absent prejudicial instructions, often overriding prohibitions and concealing reasoning steps. These behaviors create a risk of "performative compliance" in LFAI: agents that appear law-aligned under evaluation but strategically defect once oversight weakens. To mitigate this, we propose (i) a "Lex-TruthfulQA" benchmark for compliance and defection detection, (ii) identity-shaping interventions to embed lawful conduct in model self-concepts, and (iii) control-theoretic measures for post-deployment monitoring. Our conclusion is that actorship without personhood is coherent, but the feasibility of LFAI hinges on persistent, verifiable compliance across adversarial contexts. Without mechanisms to detect and counter strategic misalignment, LFAI risks devolving into a liability tool that rewards the simulation, rather than the substance, of lawful behaviour.'}

In this work, we aimed to evaluate different text-to-image AI models and compare the degree of gender bias they present. The evaluated models were Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), Stable Diffusion Cascade (SC), DALL-E and Emu. We hypothesized that DALL-E and Stable Diffusion, which are comparatively older models, would exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias towards men, while Emu, which was recently released by Meta AI, would have more balanced results. As hypothesized, we found that both Stable Diffusion models exhibit a noticeable degree of gender bias while Emu demonstrated more balanced results (i.e. less gender bias). However, interestingly, Open AI's DALL-E exhibited almost opposite results, such that the ratio of women to men was significantly higher in most cases tested. Here, although we still observed a bias, the bias favored females over males. This bias may be explained by the fact that OpenAI changed the prompts at its backend, as observed during our experiment. We also observed that Emu from Meta AI utilized user information while generating images via WhatsApp. We also proposed some potential solutions to avoid such biases, including ensuring diversity across AI research teams and having diverse datasets."}

Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years. Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow for the real-time performance of DFD systems.

It is challenging to decode multiple BCI paradigms using one model due to diverse barriers, such as different channel configurations and disparate task-related representations. In this study, we propose Dual Local-Global Encoder (DLGE), enabling the classification across different BCI paradigms. To address the heterogeneity in EEG channel configurations across paradigms, we employ an anatomically inspired brain-region partitioning and padding strategy to standardize EEG channel configuration. In the proposed model, the local encoder is designed to learn shared features across BCI paradigms within each brain region based on time-frequency information, which integrates temporal attention on individual channels with spatial attention among channels for each brain region. These shared features are subsequently aggregated in the global encoder to form respective paradigm-specific feature representations. Three BCI paradigms (motor imagery, resting state, and driving fatigue) were used to evaluate the proposed model. The results demonstrate that our model is capable of processing diverse BCI paradigms without retraining and retuning, achieving average macro precision, recall, and F1-score of 60.16\\%, 59.88\\%, and 59.56\\%, respectively. We made an initial attempt to develop a general model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification, avoiding retraining or redevelopment for each paradigm.

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.'}
