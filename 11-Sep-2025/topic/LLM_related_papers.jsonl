Using a continual pretraining setup, we study how different data selection and preprocessing strategies affect LLM performance when transitioning a model originally trained in English to another language. Our findings demonstrate the value of language-specific filtering pipelines, including classifiers for education, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as toxic content. We show that adapting a model to the target language leads to performance improvements, reinforcing the importance of high-quality, language-specific data.

Gruber, Dirk Hovy', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08825', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming social science research by enabling the automation of labor-intensive tasks like data annotation and text analysis. However, LLM outputs vary significantly depending on the implementation choices made by researchers (e.g., model selection, prompting strategy, or temperature settings). Such variation can introduce systematic biases and random errors, which propagate to downstream analyses and cause Type I, Type II, Type S, or Type M errors. We call this LLM hacking.\nWe quantify the risk of LLM hacking by replicating 37 data annotation tasks from 21 published social science research studies with 18 different models. Analyzing 13 million LLM labels, we test 2,361 realistic hypotheses to measure how plausible researcher choices affect statistical conclusions. We find incorrect conclusions based on LLM-annotated data in approximately one in three hypotheses for state-of-the-art models, and in half the hypotheses for small language models. While our findings show that higher task performance and better general model capabilities reduce LLM hacking risk, even highly accurate models do not completely eliminate it. The risk of LLM hacking decreases as effect sizes increase, indicating the need for more rigorous verification of findings near significance thresholds. Our extensive analysis of LLM hacking mitigation techniques emphasizes the importance of human annotations in reducing false positive findings and improving model selection. Surprisingly, common regression estimator correction techniques are largely ineffective in reducing LLM hacking risk, as they heavily trade off Type I vs. Type II errors.\nBeyond accidental errors, we find that intentional LLM hacking is unacceptably simple. With few LLMs and just a handful of prompt paraphrases, anything can be presented as statistically significant.'}

However, evaluating the quality of their annotations remains challenging in dynamic, unsupervised environments where oracle feedback is scarce and conventional methods fail. To address this challenge, we propose a novel agentic annotation paradigm, where a student model collaborates with a noisy teacher (the LLM) to assess and refine annotation quality without relying on oracle feedback. The student model, acting as an unsupervised feedback mechanism, employs a user preference-based majority voting strategy to evaluate the consistency of the LLM outputs. To systematically measure the reliability of LLM-generated annotations, we introduce the Consistent and Inconsistent (CAI) Ratio, a novel unsupervised evaluation metric. The CAI Ratio not only quantifies the annotation quality of the noisy teacher under limited user preferences but also plays a critical role in model selection, enabling the identification of robust LLMs in dynamic, unsupervised environments. Applied to ten open-domain NLP datasets across four LLMs, the CAI Ratio demonstrates a strong positive correlation with LLM accuracy, establishing it as an essential tool for unsupervised evaluation and model selection in real-world settings.'}

However, we argue that there are two limitations in the current methods that result in noisy multilingual preference data and further limited alignment performance: 1) Not all English responses are of high quality, and using a response with low quality may mislead the alignment for other languages. 2) Current methods usually use biased or heuristic approaches to construct multilingual preference pairs. To address these limitations, we design a consistency-based data selection method to construct high-quality multilingual preference data for improving multilingual alignment (CM-Align). Specifically, our method includes two parts: consistency-guided English reference selection and cross-lingual consistency-based multilingual preference data construction. Experimental results on three LLMs and three common tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, which further indicates the necessity of constructing high-quality preference data."}

This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition.

Evaluating our approach on the BioASQ challenge tasks, we show that ensembles can outperform individual LLMs and in some cases rival or surpass domain-tuned systems - all while preserving generalizability and avoiding the need for costly fine-tuning or labeled data. Our method aggregates outputs from multiple LLM variants, including models from Anthropic and Google, to synthesize more accurate and robust answers. Moreover, our investigation highlights a relationship between context length and performance: while expanded contexts are meant to provide valuable evidence, they simultaneously risk information dilution and model disorientation. These findings emphasize IR as a critical foundation in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches for biomedical QA systems. Precise, focused retrieval remains essential for ensuring LLMs operate within relevant information boundaries when generating answers from retrieved documents.

We invalidate this assumption by studying the BTH in causal models under prompt adaptations, as prompting is an extremely popular and accessible adaptation strategy used in real-world applications. In contrast to prior work, we find that biases can transfer through prompting and that popular prompt-based mitigation methods do not consistently prevent biases from transferring. Specifically, the correlation between intrinsic biases and those after prompt adaptation remain moderate to strong across demographics and tasks -- for example, gender (rho >= 0.94) in co-reference resolution, and age (rho >= 0.98) and religion (rho >= 0.69) in question answering. Further, we find that biases remain strongly correlated when varying few-shot composition parameters, such as sample size, stereotypical content, occupational distribution and representational balance (rho >= 0.90). We evaluate several prompt-based debiasing strategies and find that different approaches have distinct strengths, but none consistently reduce bias transfer across models, tasks or demographics. These results demonstrate that correcting bias, and potentially improving reasoning ability, in intrinsic models may prevent propagation of biases to downstream tasks.'}

Large language models (LLMs) are not trained for this objective, which raises the question: are LLMs capable of evolving efficient human-like semantic systems? To address this question, we focus on the domain of color as a key testbed of cognitive theories of categorization and replicate with LLMs (Gemini 2.0-flash and Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct) two influential human behavioral studies. First, we conduct an English color-naming study, showing that Gemini aligns well with the naming patterns of native English speakers and achieves a significantly high IB-efficiency score, while Llama exhibits an efficient but lower complexity system compared to English. Second, to test whether LLMs simply mimic patterns in their training data or actually exhibit a human-like inductive bias toward IB-efficiency, we simulate cultural evolution of pseudo color-naming systems in LLMs via iterated in-context language learning. We find that akin to humans, LLMs iteratively restructure initially random systems towards greater IB-efficiency and increased alignment with patterns observed across the world's languages. These findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of evolving perceptually grounded, human-like semantic systems, driven by the same fundamental principle that governs semantic efficiency across human languages."}

Current safety measures struggle to preserve the general capabilities of the LLM while resisting a determined adversary with full access to the model's weights and architecture, who can use full-parameter fine-tuning to erase existing safeguards. To address this, we introduce AntiDote, a bi-level optimization procedure for training LLMs to be resistant to such tampering. AntiDote involves an auxiliary adversary hypernetwork that learns to generate malicious Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) weights conditioned on the defender model's internal activations. The defender LLM is then trained with an objective to nullify the effect of these adversarial weight additions, forcing it to maintain its safety alignment. We validate this approach against a diverse suite of 52 red-teaming attacks, including jailbreak prompting, latent space manipulation, and direct weight-space attacks. AntiDote is upto 27.4\\% more robust against adversarial attacks compared to both tamper-resistance and unlearning baselines. Crucially, this robustness is achieved with a minimal trade-off in utility, incurring a performance degradation of upto less than 0.5\\% across capability benchmarks including MMLU, HellaSwag, and GSM8K.

Furthermore, we propose ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on 27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets -- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of intelligent agents.'}

The framework enhances Large Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously, we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process. Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency refinement} scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal success rate and execution efficiency."}

Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be 100\\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges. The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability requirement.'}

This evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from potential collaborators, including historical performance and available resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD) model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents, enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of collaborator selection."}

Evaluation of an LLM-based Scambaiting System', 'authors': 'Hossein Siadati, Haadi Jafarian, Sima Jafarikhah', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08493', 'abstract': 'Scammers are increasingly harnessing generative AI(GenAI) technologies to produce convincing phishing content at scale, amplifying financial fraud and undermining public trust. While conventional defenses, such as detection algorithms, user training, and reactive takedown efforts remain important, they often fall short in dismantling the infrastructure scammers depend on, including mule bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. To bridge this gap, a proactive and emerging strategy involves using conversational honeypots to engage scammers and extract actionable threat intelligence. This paper presents the first large-scale, real-world evaluation of a scambaiting system powered by large language models (LLMs). Over a five-month deployment, the system initiated over 2,600 engagements with actual scammers, resulting in a dataset of more than 18,700 messages. It achieved an Information Disclosure Rate (IDR) of approximately 32%, successfully extracting sensitive financial information such as mule accounts. Additionally, the system maintained a Human Acceptance Rate (HAR) of around 70%, indicating strong alignment between LLM-generated responses and human operator preferences. Alongside these successes, our analysis reveals key operational challenges. In particular, the system struggled with engagement takeoff: only 48.7% of scammers responded to the initial seed message sent by defenders. These findings highlight the need for further refinement and provide actionable insights for advancing the design of automated scambaiting systems.'}

While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.'}

Homomorphic encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference. However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax, an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax, proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.'}

This study proposes an adaptive weight optimization framework for SIBT planning, driven by large language models (LLMs). A locally deployed DeepSeek-R1 LLM is integrated with an automatic planning algorithm in an iterative loop. Starting with fixed weights, the LLM evaluates plan quality and recommends new weights in the next iteration. This process continues until convergence criteria are met, after which the LLM conducts a comprehensive evaluation to identify the optimal plan. A clinical knowledge base, constructed and queried via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enhances the model's domain-specific reasoning. The proposed method was validated on 23 patient cases, showing that the LLM-assisted approach produces plans that are comparable to or exceeding clinically approved and fixed-weight plans, in terms of dose homogeneity for the clinical target volume (CTV) and sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The study demonstrates the potential use of LLMs in SIBT planning automation."}

Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset (FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization (UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability. After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\\% improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group, demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.'}

However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs. Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget, thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines."}

We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.

In this paper, we propose a semantic multiple access scheme in the token domain, referred to as token domain multiple access (ToDMA), where a large number of devices share a token codebook and a modulation codebook for source and channel coding, respectively. Specifically, each transmitter first tokenizes its source signal and modulate each token to a codeword. At the receiver, compressed sensing is employed first to detect active tokens and the corresponding channel state information (CSI) from the superposed signals. Then, the source token sequences are reconstructed by clustering the token-associated CSI across multiple time slots. In case of token collisions, some active tokens cannot be assigned and some positions in the reconstructed token sequences are empty. We propose to use pre-trained MLLMs to leverage the context, predict masked tokens, and thus mitigate token collisions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ToDMA framework for both text and image transmission tasks, achieving significantly lower latency compared to context-unaware orthogonal communication schemes, while also delivering superior distortion and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art context-unaware non-orthogonal communication methods.'}
