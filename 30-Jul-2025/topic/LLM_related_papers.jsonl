Our evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and explainable RCA in network operation and management.'}

UserBench features simulated users who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally, requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only 20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task executors, but true collaborative partners.

Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it. The README files should contain project-related information as per the recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories. However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations. This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1 score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of GitHub README files.

Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively, methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs, rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation. Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.'}

This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark, consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment.

Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they "understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity.

For the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented specialties.

Large Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits (e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance. We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router.

This paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure \\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \\textit{how} they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given model. This profile is centered on the \\textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a visualization that traces how a model\'s normalized predictive uncertainty changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity. We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of artificial intelligence.'}

However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings, defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements -- that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.'}

This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations. These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs. Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated, and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code. Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers' workflows."}

Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts, exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However, text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs: multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts. Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection."}

Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging.

In contrast to existing approaches that rely on multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in resource-constrained mobile environments.

These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.'}

While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences. Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low, and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible with standard decoding pipelines.

This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced: tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override.

The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper contains illicit content that potentially induces harms."}

However, current reward models underperform in challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations: 1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and 2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application, and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with unlabeled data.'}

To address these issues, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions. Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information."}

While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of interest, given only a natural-language description."}

Previous studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries, enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between robustness and generalisation.'}

By exposing models to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks.

MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1) Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode, combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100 consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average), while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%). Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion.

However, persistent concerns about embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives. Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical alignment.'}

Building safety classification models or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue. Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves, there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.'}

To bridge this gap, we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal, financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained domain-specific safety improvements.

However, they often face challenges in acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals, limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.\nWe introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.\nOur investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats typically present in training datasets.\nThese findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality.

Existing efficiency methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging, offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE (Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on MVBench up to 2$\\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be released soon."}

Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over traditional separate setups.
