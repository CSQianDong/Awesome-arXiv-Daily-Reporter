A natural question that arises is how effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness. Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection, showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better reasoning and safer systems.'}

In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines.

In this paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent\'s current belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit, 2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue scenarios.'}

While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here, we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering, while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features, exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together, these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs."}

While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise, especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced, multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable, interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical reasoning.'}

Jordan, Stuart Russell, Song Mei', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10887', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning, but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information. However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.'}

We show that for all pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers.

However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates.

We focus on tokenizer design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining, by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages included in pretraining.'}

This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.'}

In this work, we investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that, although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct "breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge neurons, and inspection of attention weights.'}

To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.'}

In this paper, we investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores. However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer, this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers.

We build a new dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous cases.

In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's overall performance.

Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities.

In cases where the student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model, versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis.

While self-training methods have proven effective in semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data, allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and adaptability."}

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors.

Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments."}

But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions."}

However, how to extend this capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.'}

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context."}

Rasoul Etesami', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10946', 'abstract': 'Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.'}

While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model\'s chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\\%, always below 2.5\\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.'}

We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications.

Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues, we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer), and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features, attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion. To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs, ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\\% to 60\\% over the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: this https URL"}

To tackle these challenges, we propose a causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings: specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.'}

We develop a no-regret algorithm, called $\\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with the transfer eluder dimension of the problem.

Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation between output and logit accuracy is strong.

Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters, while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
