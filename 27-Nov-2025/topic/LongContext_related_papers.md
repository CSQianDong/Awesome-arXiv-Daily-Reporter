**Abstract**: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

# Structured Definitions and Segmentations for Legal Reasoning in LLMs: A Study on Indian Legal Data

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

# Gated KalmaNet: A Fading Memory Layer Through Test-Time Ridge Regression

**Abstract**: As efficient alternatives to softmax Attention, linear state-space models (SSMs) achieve constant memory and linear compute, but maintain only a lossy, fading summary of the past, often leading to inferior performance in recall oriented tasks. We propose Gated KalmaNet (GKA), a layer that reduces this gap by accounting for the full past when predicting the next token, while maintaining SSM-style efficiency. GKA achieves this by solving an online ridge regression problem at test time, with constant memory and linear compute cost in the sequence length. Drawing inspiration from the Kalman Filter, we iteratively solve the online ridge regression problem. However, a critical insight is that standard Kalman filter equations are numerically unstable in low-precision environments (like bfloat16) and difficult to parallelize in modern hardware. We address both challenges through two key innovations: (1) an adaptive regularization strategy with input-dependent gating that controls the condition number of the ridge regression, ensuring numerical stability while balancing memory retention. And (2) the use of Chebyshev Iteration instead of other conventional iterative solvers, which we demonstrate to be more stable in low-precision settings. To further improve scalability, we develop a hardware-aware chunk-wise implementation of Chebyshev Iteration along with custom kernels for backpropagating through our adaptive regularization and gating mechanisms. Empirically, GKA shows strong language understanding capabilites on short-context tasks outperforming existing SSM layers (like Mamba2, GLA and Gated DeltaNet). On long-context, GKA excels at real-world RAG and LongQA tasks up to 128k tokens, achieving more than $10$% relative improvement over other fading memory baselines.
