**Authors**: Andrew Crossman, Andrew R. Plummer, Chandra Sekharudu, Deepak Warrier, Mohammad Yekrangian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09586)  

**Abstract**: We present Auspex - a threat modeling system built using a specialized collection of generative artificial intelligence-based methods that capture threat modeling tradecraft. This new approach, called tradecraft prompting, centers on encoding the on-the-ground knowledge of threat modelers within the prompts that drive a generative AI-based threat modeling system. Auspex employs tradecraft prompts in two processing stages. The first stage centers on ingesting and processing system architecture information using prompts that encode threat modeling tradecraft knowledge pertaining to system decomposition and description. The second stage centers on chaining the resulting system analysis through a collection of prompts that encode tradecraft knowledge on threat identification, classification, and mitigation. The two-stage process yields a threat matrix for a system that specifies threat scenarios, threat types, information security categorizations and potential mitigations. Auspex produces formalized threat model output in minutes, relative to the weeks or months a manual process takes. More broadly, the focus on bespoke tradecraft prompting, as opposed to fine-tuning or agent-based add-ons, makes Auspex a lightweight, flexible, modular, and extensible foundational system capable of addressing the complexity, resource, and standardization limitations of both existing manual and automated threat modeling processes. In this connection, we establish the baseline value of Auspex to threat modelers through an evaluation procedure based on feedback collected from cybersecurity subject matter experts measuring the quality and utility of threat models generated by Auspex on real banking systems. We conclude with a discussion of system performance and plans for enhancements to Auspex.

**Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng, Jiannan Guan, Peng Wang, Mengkang Hu, Yuhang Zhou, Te Gao, Wangxiang Che  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09567)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "test-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and test-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

# The Value of Goal Commitment in Planning 

**Authors**: Alberto Pozanco, Marianela Morales, Daniel Borrajo, Manuela Veloso  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09545)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we revisit the concept of goal commitment from early planners in the presence of current forward chaining heuristic planners. We present a compilation that extends the original planning task with commit actions that enforce the persistence of specific goals once achieved, thereby committing to them in the search sub-tree. This approach imposes a specific goal achievement order in parts of the search tree, potentially introducing dead-end states. This can reduce search effort if the goal achievement order is correct. Otherwise, the search algorithm can expand nodes in the open list where goals do not persist. Experimental results demonstrate that the reformulated tasks suit state-of-the-art agile planners, enabling them to find better

# PairVDN - Pair-wise Decomposed Value Functions 

**Authors**: Zak Buzzard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09521)  

**Abstract**: Extending deep Q-learning to cooperative multi-agent settings is challenging due to the exponential growth of the joint action space, the non-stationary environment, and the credit assignment problem. Value decomposition allows deep Q-learning to be applied at the joint agent level, at the cost of reduced expressivity. Building on past work in this direction, our paper proposes PairVDN, a novel method for decomposing the value function into a collection of pair-wise, rather than per-agent, functions, improving expressivity at the cost of requiring a more complex (but still efficient) dynamic programming maximisation algorithm. Our method enables the representation of value functions which cannot be expressed as a monotonic combination of per-agent functions, unlike past approaches such as VDN and QMIX. We implement a novel many-agent cooperative environment, Box Jump, and demonstrate improved performance over these baselines in this setting. We open-source our code and environment at this https URL.

# ReMA: Learning to Meta-think for LLMs with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Ziyu Wan, Yunxiang Li, Yan Song, Hanjing Wang, Linyi Yang, Mark Schmidt, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang, Shuyue Hu, Ying Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09501)  

**Abstract**: Recent research on Reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sought to further enhance their performance by integrating meta-thinking -- enabling models to monitor, evaluate, and control their reasoning processes for more adaptive and effective problem-solving. However, current single-agent work lacks a specialized design for acquiring meta-thinking, resulting in low efficacy. To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforced Meta-thinking Agents (ReMA), a novel framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to elicit meta-thinking behaviors, encouraging LLMs to think about thinking. ReMA decouples the reasoning process into two hierarchical agents: a high-level meta-thinking agent responsible for generating strategic oversight and plans, and a low-level reasoning agent for detailed executions. Through iterative reinforcement learning with aligned objectives, these agents explore and learn collaboration, leading to improved generalization and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that ReMA outperforms single-agent RL baselines on complex reasoning tasks, including competitive-level mathematical benchmarks and LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further illustrate the evolving dynamics of each distinct agent, providing valuable insights into how the meta-thinking reasoning process enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

# Online Language Splatting 

**Authors**: Saimouli Katragadda, Cho-Ying Wu, Yuliang Guo, Xinyu Huang, Guoquan Huang, Liu Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09447)  

**Abstract**: To enable AI agents to interact seamlessly with both humans and 3D environments, they must not only perceive the 3D world accurately but also align human language with 3D spatial representations. While prior work has made significant progress by integrating language features into geometrically detailed 3D scene representations using 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS), these approaches rely on computationally intensive offline preprocessing of language features for each input image, limiting adaptability to new environments. In this work, we introduce Online Language Splatting, the first framework to achieve online, near real-time, open-vocabulary language mapping within a 3DGS-SLAM system without requiring pre-generated language features. The key challenge lies in efficiently fusing high-dimensional language features into 3D representations while balancing the computation speed, memory usage, rendering quality and open-vocabulary capability. To this end, we innovatively design: (1) a high-resolution CLIP embedding module capable of generating detailed language feature maps in 18ms per frame, (2) a two-stage online auto-encoder that compresses 768-dimensional CLIP features to 15 dimensions while preserving open-vocabulary capabilities, and (3) a color-language disentangled optimization approach to improve rendering quality. Experimental results show that our online method not only surpasses the state-of-the-art offline methods in accuracy but also achieves more than 40x efficiency boost, demonstrating the potential for dynamic and interactive AI applications.

# In-Context Defense in Computer Agents: An Empirical Study 

**Authors**: Pei Yang, Hai Ci, Mike Zheng Shou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09241)  

**Abstract**: Computer agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced human-computer interaction, enabling users to perform complex tasks through natural language instructions. However, these agents are vulnerable to context deception attacks, an emerging threat where adversaries embed misleading content into the agent's operational environment, such as a pop-up window containing deceptive instructions. Existing defenses, such as instructing agents to ignore deceptive elements, have proven largely ineffective. As the first systematic study on protecting computer agents, we introduce textbf{in-context defense}, leveraging in-context learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to counter such attacks. Our approach involves augmenting the agent's context with a small set of carefully curated exemplars containing both malicious environments and corresponding defensive responses. These exemplars guide the agent to first perform explicit defensive reasoning before action planning, reducing susceptibility to deceptive attacks. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing attack success rates by 91.2% on pop-up window attacks, 74.6% on average on environment injection attacks, while achieving 100% successful defenses against distracting advertisements. Our findings highlight that (1) defensive reasoning must precede action planning for optimal performance, and (2) a minimal number of exemplars (fewer than three) is sufficient to induce an agent's defensive behavior.

**Authors**: Joscha Grüger, Tobias Geyer, Tobias Brix, Michael Storck, Sonja Leson, Laura Bley, Carsten Weishaupt, Ralph Bergmann, Stephan A. Braun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09164)  

**Abstract**: This research focuses on evaluating and enhancing data readiness for the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) in the context of skin cancer treatment. The study, conducted at the Skin Tumor Center of the University Hospital Münster, delves into the essential role of data quality, availability, and extractability in implementing effective AI applications in oncology. By employing a multifaceted methodology, including literature review, data readiness assessment, and expert workshops, the study addresses the challenges of integrating AI into clinical decision-making. The research identifies crucial data points for skin cancer treatment decisions, evaluates their presence and quality in various information systems, and highlights the difficulties in extracting information from unstructured data. The findings underline the significance of high-quality, accessible data for the success of AI-driven CDSS in medical settings, particularly in the complex field of oncology.

# Imitation Learning of Correlated Policies in Stackelberg Games 

**Authors**: Kunag-Da Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Wen-Chih Peng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08883)  

**Abstract**: Stackelberg games, widely applied in domains like economics and security, involve asymmetric interactions where a leader's strategy drives follower responses. Accurately modeling these dynamics allows domain experts to optimize strategies in interactive scenarios, such as turn-based sports like badminton. In multi-agent systems, agent behaviors are interdependent, and traditional Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) methods often fail to capture these complex interactions. Correlated policies, which account for opponents' strategies, are essential for accurately modeling such dynamics. However, even methods designed for learning correlated policies, like CoDAIL, struggle in Stackelberg games due to their asymmetric decision-making, where leaders and followers cannot simultaneously account for each other's actions, often leading to non-correlated policies. Furthermore, existing MAIL methods that match occupancy measures or use adversarial techniques like GAIL or Inverse RL face scalability challenges, particularly in high-dimensional environments, and suffer from unstable training. To address these challenges, we propose a correlated policy occupancy measure specifically designed for Stackelberg games and introduce the Latent Stackelberg Differential Network (LSDN) to match it. LSDN models two-agent interactions as shared latent state trajectories and uses multi-output Geometric Brownian Motion (MO-GBM) to effectively capture joint policies. By leveraging MO-GBM, LSDN disentangles environmental influences from agent-driven transitions in latent space, enabling the simultaneous learning of interdependent policies. This design eliminates the need for adversarial training and simplifies the learning process. Extensive experiments on Iterative Matrix Games and multi-agent particle environments demonstrate that LSDN can better reproduce complex interaction dynamics than existing MAIL methods.

# Combining Local Symmetry Exploitation and Reinforcement Learning for Optimised Probabilistic Inference -- A Work In Progress 

**Authors**: Sagad Hamid, Tanya Braun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08786)  

**Abstract**: Efficient probabilistic inference by variable elimination in graphical models requires an optimal elimination order. However, finding an optimal order is a challenging combinatorial optimisation problem for models with a large number of random variables. Most recently, a reinforcement learning approach has been proposed to find efficient contraction orders in tensor networks. Due to the duality between graphical models and tensor networks, we adapt this approach to probabilistic inference in graphical models. Furthermore, we incorporate structure exploitation into the process of finding an optimal order. Currently, the agent's cost function is formulated in terms of intermediate result sizes which are exponential in the number of indices (i.e., random variables). We show that leveraging specific structures during inference allows for introducing compact encodings of intermediate results which can be significantly smaller. By considering the compact encoding sizes for the cost function instead, we enable the agent to explore more efficient contraction orders. The structure we consider in this work is the presence of local symmetries (i.e., symmetries within a model's factors).

# Neurosymbolic Decision Trees 

**Authors**: Matthias Möller, Arvid Norlander, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires, Luc De Raedt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08762)  

**Abstract**: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI studies the integration of neural networks (NNs) and symbolic reasoning based on logic. Usually, NeSy techniques focus on learning the neural, probabilistic and/or fuzzy parameters of NeSy models. Learning the symbolic or logical structure of such models has, so far, received less attention. We introduce neurosymbolic decision trees (NDTs), as an extension of decision trees together with a novel NeSy structure learning algorithm, which we dub NeuID3. NeuID3 adapts the standard top-down induction of decision tree algorithms and combines it with a neural probabilistic logic representation, inherited from the DeepProbLog family of models. The key advantage of learning NDTs with NeuID3 is the support of both symbolic and subsymbolic data (such as images), and that they can exploit background knowledge during the induction of the tree structure, In our experimental evaluation we demonstrate the benefits of NeSys structure learning over more traditonal approaches such as purely data-driven learning with neural networks.

# How to Protect Yourself from 5G Radiation? Investigating LLM Responses to Implicit Misinformation 

**Authors**: Ruohao Guo, Wei Xu, Alan Ritter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09598)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in diverse scenarios, the extent to which they could tacitly spread misinformation emerges as a critical safety concern. Current research primarily evaluates LLMs on explicit false statements, overlooking how misinformation often manifests subtly as unchallenged premises in real-world user interactions. We curated ECHOMIST, the first comprehensive benchmark for implicit misinformation, where the misinformed assumptions are embedded in a user query to LLMs. ECHOMIST is based on rigorous selection criteria and carefully curated data from diverse sources, including real-world human-AI conversations and social media interactions. We also introduce a new evaluation metric to measure whether LLMs can recognize and counter false information rather than amplify users' misconceptions. Through an extensive empirical study on a wide range of LLMs, including GPT-4, Claude, and Llama, we find that current models perform alarmingly poorly on this task, often failing to detect false premises and generating misleading explanations. Our findings underscore the critical need for an increased focus on implicit misinformation in LLM safety research.

# Cost-Optimal Grouped-Query Attention for Long-Context LLMs 

**Authors**: Yingfa Chen, Yutong Wu, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09579)  

**Abstract**: Building effective and efficient Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has recently become a research focus, requiring maximizing model language capabilities and minimizing training and deployment costs. Existing efforts have primarily described complex relationships among model performance, parameter size, and data size, as well as searched for the optimal compute allocation to train LLMs. However, they overlook the impacts of context length and attention head configuration (the number of query and key-value heads in grouped-query attention) on training and inference. In this paper, we systematically compare models with different parameter sizes, context lengths, and attention head configurations in terms of model performance, computational cost, and memory cost. Then, we extend the existing scaling methods, which are based solely on parameter size and training compute, to guide the construction of cost-optimal LLMs during both training and inference. Our quantitative scaling studies show that, when processing sufficiently long sequences, a larger model with fewer attention heads can achieve a lower loss while incurring lower computational and memory costs. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing practical LLMs, especially in long-context processing scenarios. We will publicly release our code and data.

# Block Diffusion: Interpolating Between Autoregressive and Diffusion Language Models 

**Authors**: Marianne Arriola, Aaron Gokaslan, Justin T Chiu, Zhihan Yang, Zhixuan Qi, Jiaqi Han, Subham Sekhar Sahoo, Volodymyr Kuleshov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09573)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion language models offer unique benefits over autoregressive models due to their potential for parallelized generation and controllability, yet they lag in likelihood modeling and are limited to fixed-length generation. In this work, we introduce a class of block diffusion language models that interpolate between discrete denoising diffusion and autoregressive models. Block diffusion overcomes key limitations of both approaches by supporting flexible-length generation and improving inference efficiency with KV caching and parallel token sampling. We propose a recipe for building effective block diffusion models that includes an efficient training algorithm, estimators of gradient variance, and data-driven noise schedules to minimize the variance. Block diffusion sets a new state-of-the-art performance among diffusion models on language modeling benchmarks and enables generation of arbitrary-length sequences. We provide the code, along with the model weights and blog post on the project page: this https URL

# Global Convergence and Rich Feature Learning in $L$-Layer Infinite-Width Neural Networks under $μ$P Parametrization 

**Authors**: Zixiang Chen, Greg Yang, Qingyue Zhao, Quanquan Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09565)  

**Abstract**: Despite deep neural networks' powerful representation learning capabilities, theoretical understanding of how networks can simultaneously achieve meaningful feature learning and global convergence remains elusive. Existing approaches like the neural tangent kernel (NTK) are limited because features stay close to their initialization in this parametrization, leaving open questions about feature properties during substantial evolution. In this paper, we investigate the training dynamics of infinitely wide, $L$-layer neural networks using the tensor program (TP) framework. Specifically, we show that, when trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the Maximal Update parametrization ($\mu$P) and mild conditions on the activation function, SGD enables these networks to learn linearly independent features that substantially deviate from their initial values. This rich feature space captures relevant data information and ensures that any convergent point of the training process is a global minimum. Our analysis leverages both the interactions among features across layers and the properties of Gaussian random variables, providing new insights into deep representation learning. We further validate our theoretical findings through experiments on real-world datasets.

# Differentially Private Equilibrium Finding in Polymatrix Games 

**Authors**: Mingyang Liu, Gabriele Farina, Asuman Ozdaglar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09538)  

**Abstract**: We study equilibrium finding in polymatrix games under differential privacy constraints. To start, we show that high accuracy and asymptotically vanishing differential privacy budget (as the number of players goes to infinity) cannot be achieved simultaneously under either of the two settings: (i) We seek to establish equilibrium approximation guarantees in terms of Euclidean distance to the equilibrium set, and (ii) the adversary has access to all communication channels. Then, assuming the adversary has access to a constant number of communication channels, we develop a novel distributed algorithm that recovers strategies with simultaneously vanishing Nash gap (in expected utility, also referred to as exploitability and privacy budget as the number of players increases.

# GenHPE: Generative Counterfactuals for 3D Human Pose Estimation with Radio Frequency Signals 

**Authors**: Shuokang Huang, Julie A. McCann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09537)  

**Abstract**: Human pose estimation (HPE) detects the positions of human body joints for various applications. Compared to using cameras, HPE using radio frequency (RF) signals is non-intrusive and more robust to adverse conditions, exploiting the signal variations caused by human interference. However, existing studies focus on single-domain HPE confined by domain-specific confounders, which cannot generalize to new domains and result in diminished HPE performance. Specifically, the signal variations caused by different human body parts are entangled, containing subject-specific confounders. RF signals are also intertwined with environmental noise, involving environment-specific confounders. In this paper, we propose GenHPE, a 3D HPE approach that generates counterfactual RF signals to eliminate domain-specific confounders. GenHPE trains generative models conditioned on human skeleton labels, learning how human body parts and confounders interfere with RF signals. We manipulate skeleton labels (i.e., removing body parts) as counterfactual conditions for generative models to synthesize counterfactual RF signals. The differences between counterfactual signals approximately eliminate domain-specific confounders and regularize an encoder-decoder model to learn domain-independent representations. Such representations help GenHPE generalize to new subjects/environments for cross-domain 3D HPE. We evaluate GenHPE on three public datasets from WiFi, ultra-wideband, and millimeter wave. Experimental results show that GenHPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods and reduces estimation errors by up to 52.2mm for cross-subject HPE and 10.6mm for cross-environment HPE.

# Evaluating Visual Explanations of Attention Maps for Transformer-based Medical Imaging 

**Authors**: Minjae Chung, Jong Bum Won, Ganghyun Kim, Yujin Kim, Utku Ozbulak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09535)  

**Abstract**: Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated superior performance in medical imaging problems, they face explainability issues similar to previous architectures such as convolutional neural networks. Recent research efforts suggest that attention maps, which are part of decision-making process of ViTs can potentially address the explainability issue by identifying regions influencing predictions, especially in models pretrained with self-supervised learning. In this work, we compare the visual explanations of attention maps to other commonly used methods for medical imaging problems. To do so, we employ four distinct medical imaging datasets that involve the identification of (1) colonic polyps, (2) breast tumors, (3) esophageal inflammation, and (4) bone fractures and hardware implants. Through large-scale experiments on the aforementioned datasets using various supervised and self-supervised pretrained ViTs, we find that although attention maps show promise under certain conditions and generally surpass GradCAM in explainability, they are outperformed by transformer-specific interpretability methods. Our findings indicate that the efficacy of attention maps as a method of interpretability is context-dependent and may be limited as they do not consistently provide the comprehensive insights required for robust medical decision-making.

# CombatVLA: An Efficient Vision-Language-Action Model for Combat Tasks in 3D Action Role-Playing Games 

**Authors**: Peng Chen, Pi Bu, Yingyao Wang, Xinyi Wang, Ziming Wang, Jie Guo, Yingxiu Zhao, Qi Zhu, Jun Song, Siran Yang, Jiamang Wang, Bo Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09527)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have expanded the capabilities of embodied intelligence. However, significant challenges remain in real-time decision-making in complex 3D environments, which demand second-level responses, high-resolution perception, and tactical reasoning under dynamic conditions. To advance the field, we introduce CombatVLA, an efficient VLA model optimized for combat tasks in 3D action role-playing games(ARPGs). Specifically, our CombatVLA is a 3B model trained on video-action pairs collected by an action tracker, where the data is formatted as action-of-thought (AoT) sequences. Thereafter, CombatVLA seamlessly integrates into an action execution framework, allowing efficient inference through our truncated AoT strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that CombatVLA not only outperforms all existing models on the combat understanding benchmark but also achieves a 50-fold acceleration in game combat. Moreover, it has a higher task success rate than human players. We will open-source all resources, including the action tracker, dataset, benchmark, model weights, training code, and the implementation of the framework at this https URL.

# Search-R1: Training LLMs to Reason and Leverage Search Engines with Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Bowen Jin, Hansi Zeng, Zhenrui Yue, Dong Wang, Hamed Zamani, Jiawei Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09516)  

**Abstract**: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Retrieval augmentation and tool-use training approaches where a search engine is treated as a tool lack complex multi-turn retrieval flexibility or require large-scale supervised data. Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities during inference to use search engines is not optimal, since the LLM does not learn how to optimally interact with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of the DeepSeek-R1 model where the LLM learns -- solely through reinforcement learning (RL) -- to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM rollouts with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 26% (Qwen2.5-7B), 21% (Qwen2.5-3B), and 10% (LLaMA3.2-3B) over SOTA baselines. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning. The code and model checkpoints are available at this https URL.

# RESTRAIN: Reinforcement Learning-Based Secure Framework for Trigger-Action IoT Environment 

**Authors**: Md Morshed Alam, Lokesh Chandra Das, Sandip Roy, Sachin Shetty, Weichao Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09513)  

**Abstract**: Internet of Things (IoT) platforms with trigger-action capability allow event conditions to trigger actions in IoT devices autonomously by creating a chain of interactions. Adversaries exploit this chain of interactions to maliciously inject fake event conditions into IoT hubs, triggering unauthorized actions on target IoT devices to implement remote injection attacks. Existing defense mechanisms focus mainly on the verification of event transactions using physical event fingerprints to enforce the security policies to block unsafe event transactions. These approaches are designed to provide offline defense against injection attacks. The state-of-the-art online defense mechanisms offer real-time defense, but extensive reliability on the inference of attack impacts on the IoT network limits the generalization capability of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a platform-independent multi-agent online defense system, namely RESTRAIN, to counter remote injection attacks at runtime. RESTRAIN allows the defense agent to profile attack actions at runtime and leverages reinforcement learning to optimize a defense policy that complies with the security requirements of the IoT network. The experimental results show that the defense agent effectively takes real-time defense actions against complex and dynamic remote injection attacks and maximizes the security gain with minimal computational overhead.

# Double-Stage Feature-Level Clustering-Based Mixture of Experts Framework 

**Authors**: Bakary Badjie, José Cecílio, António Casimiro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09504)  

**Abstract**: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has succeeded in deep learning (DL). However, its complex architecture and advantages over dense models in image classification remain unclear. In previous studies, MoE performance has often been affected by noise and outliers in the input space. Some approaches incorporate input clustering for training MoE models, but most clustering algorithms lack access to labeled data, limiting their effectiveness. This paper introduces the Double-stage Feature-level Clustering and Pseudo-labeling-based Mixture of Experts (DFCP-MoE) framework, which consists of input feature extraction, feature-level clustering, and a computationally efficient pseudo-labeling strategy. This approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers while leveraging a small subset of labeled data to label a large portion of unlabeled inputs. We propose a conditional end-to-end joint training method that improves expert specialization by training the MoE model on well-labeled, clustered inputs. Unlike traditional MoE and dense models, the DFCP-MoE framework effectively captures input space diversity, leading to competitive inference results. We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets for multi-class classification tasks.

# MindGYM: Enhancing Vision-Language Models via Synthetic Self-Challenging Questions 

**Authors**: Zhe Xu, Daoyuan Chen, Zhenqing Ling, Yaliang Li, Ying Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09499)  

**Abstract**: Large vision-language models (VLMs) face challenges in achieving robust, transferable reasoning abilities due to reliance on labor-intensive manual instruction datasets or computationally expensive self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we introduce MindGYM, a framework that enhances VLMs through synthetic self-challenging questions, consisting of three stages: (1) Seed Single-Hop Question Synthesis, generating cognitive questions across textual (e.g., logical deduction) and multimodal contexts (e.g., diagram-based queries) spanning eight semantic areas like ethical analysis; (2) Challenging Multi-Hop Question Synthesis, combining seed questions via diverse principles like bridging, visual-textual alignment, to create multi-step problems demanding deeper reasoning; and (3) Thinking-Induced Curriculum Fine-Tuning, a structured pipeline that progressively trains the model from scaffolded reasoning to standalone inference. By leveraging the model's self-synthesis capability, MindGYM achieves high data efficiency (e.g., +16% gains on MathVision-Mini with only 400 samples), computational efficiency (reducing both training and inference costs), and robust generalization across tasks. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks demonstrate superior performance over strong baselines, with notable improvements (+15.77% win rates) in reasoning depth and breadth validated via GPT-based scoring. MindGYM underscores the viability of self-challenging for refining VLM capabilities while minimizing human intervention and resource demands. Code and data are released to advance multimodal reasoning research.

# Sparse Autoencoder as a Zero-Shot Classifier for Concept Erasing in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Zhihua Tian, Sirun Nan, Ming Xu, Shengfang Zhai, Wenjie Qu, Jian Liu, Kui Ren, Ruoxi Jia, Jiaheng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09446)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating high-quality images but also raise people's concerns about generating harmful or misleading content. While extensive approaches have been proposed to erase unwanted concepts without requiring retraining from scratch, they inadvertently degrade performance on normal generation tasks. In this work, we propose Interpret then Deactivate (ItD), a novel framework to enable precise concept removal in T2I diffusion models while preserving overall performance. ItD first employs a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to interpret each concept as a combination of multiple features. By permanently deactivating the specific features associated with target concepts, we repurpose SAE as a zero-shot classifier that identifies whether the input prompt includes target concepts, allowing selective concept erasure in diffusion models. Moreover, we demonstrate that ItD can be easily extended to erase multiple concepts without requiring further training. Comprehensive experiments across celebrity identities, artistic styles, and explicit content demonstrate ItD's effectiveness in eliminating targeted concepts without interfering with normal concept generation. Additionally, ItD is also robust against adversarial prompts designed to circumvent content filters. Code is available at: this https URL.

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a pivotal paradigm in multimodal understanding, offering a powerful framework for integrating visual and linguistic information. However, the increasing complexity and diversity of tasks present significant challenges in coordinating load balancing across heterogeneous visual experts, where optimizing one specialist's performance often compromises others' capabilities. To address task heterogeneity and expert load imbalance, we propose Astrea, a novel multi-expert collaborative VLM architecture based on progressive pre-alignment. Astrea introduces three key innovations: 1) A heterogeneous expert coordination mechanism that integrates four specialized models (detection, segmentation, classification, captioning) into a comprehensive expert matrix covering essential visual comprehension elements; 2) A dynamic knowledge fusion strategy featuring progressive pre-alignment to harmonize experts within the VLM latent space through contrastive learning, complemented by probabilistically activated stochastic residual connections to preserve knowledge continuity; 3) An enhanced optimization framework utilizing momentum contrastive learning for long-range dependency modeling and adaptive weight allocators for real-time expert contribution calibration. Extensive evaluations across 12 benchmark tasks spanning VQA, image captioning, and cross-modal retrieval demonstrate Astrea's superiority over state-of-the-art models, achieving an average performance gain of +4.7\%. This study provides the first empirical demonstration that progressive pre-alignment strategies enable VLMs to overcome task heterogeneity limitations, establishing new methodological foundations for developing general-purpose multimodal agents.

**Authors**: Krzysztof Adamkiewicz, Paweł W. Woźniak, Julia Dominiak, Andrzej Romanowski, Jakob Karolus, Stanislav Frolov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09436)  

**Abstract**: Recent technological advances popularized the use of image generation among the general public. Crafting effective prompts can, however, be difficult for novice users. To tackle this challenge, we developed PromptMap, a new interaction style for text-to-image AI that allows users to freely explore a vast collection of synthetic prompts through a map-like view with semantic zoom. PromptMap groups images visually by their semantic similarity, allowing users to discover relevant examples. We evaluated PromptMap in a between-subject online study ($n=60$) and a qualitative within-subject study ($n=12$). We found that PromptMap supported users in crafting prompts by providing them with examples. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using LLMs to create vast example collections. Our work contributes a new interaction style that supports users unfamiliar with prompting in achieving a satisfactory image output.

# CASTLE: Benchmarking Dataset for Static Code Analyzers and LLMs towards CWE Detection 

**Authors**: Richard A. Dubniczky, Krisztofer Zoltán Horvát, Tamás Bisztray, Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Lucas C. Cordeiro, Norbert Tihanyi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09433)  

**Abstract**: Identifying vulnerabilities in source code is crucial, especially in critical software components. Existing methods such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, formal verification, and recently Large Language Models are widely used to detect security flaws. This paper introduces CASTLE (CWE Automated Security Testing and Low-Level Evaluation), a benchmarking framework for evaluating the vulnerability detection capabilities of different methods. We assess 13 static analysis tools, 10 LLMs, and 2 formal verification tools using a hand-crafted dataset of 250 micro-benchmark programs covering 25 common CWEs. We propose the CASTLE Score, a novel evaluation metric to ensure fair comparison. Our results reveal key differences: ESBMC (a formal verification tool) minimizes false positives but struggles with vulnerabilities beyond model checking, such as weak cryptography or SQL injection. Static analyzers suffer from high false positives, increasing manual validation efforts for developers. LLMs perform exceptionally well in the CASTLE dataset when identifying vulnerabilities in small code snippets. However, their accuracy declines, and hallucinations increase as the code size grows. These results suggest that LLMs could play a pivotal role in future security solutions, particularly within code completion frameworks, where they can provide real-time guidance to prevent vulnerabilities. The dataset is accessible at this https URL.

# Multimodal Language Modeling for High-Accuracy Single Cell Transcriptomics Analysis and Generation 

**Authors**: Yaorui Shi, Jiaqi Yang, Sihang Li, Junfeng Fang, Xiang Wang, Zhiyuan Liu, Yang Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09427)  

**Abstract**: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have revolutionized scientific research, yet their application to single-cell analysis remains limited. Text PLMs cannot process single-cell RNA sequencing data, while cell PLMs lack the ability to handle free text, restricting their use in multimodal tasks. Existing efforts to bridge these modalities often suffer from information loss or inadequate single-modal pre-training, leading to suboptimal performances. To address these challenges, we propose Single-Cell MultiModal Generative Pre-trained Transformer (scMMGPT), a unified PLM for joint cell and text modeling. scMMGPT effectively integrates the state-of-the-art cell and text PLMs, facilitating cross-modal knowledge sharing for improved performance. To bridge the text-cell modality gap, scMMGPT leverages dedicated cross-modal projectors, and undergoes extensive pre-training on 27 million cells -- the largest dataset for multimodal cell-text PLMs to date. This large-scale pre-training enables scMMGPT to excel in joint cell-text tasks, achieving an 84\% relative improvement of textual discrepancy for cell description generation, 20.5\% higher accuracy for cell type annotation, and 4\% improvement in $k$-NN accuracy for text-conditioned pseudo-cell generation, outperforming baselines.

# AI-based Framework for Robust Model-Based Connector Mating in Robotic Wire Harness Installation 

**Authors**: Claudius Kienle, Benjamin Alt, Finn Schneider, Tobias Pertlwieser, Rainer Jäkel, Rania Rayyes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09409)  

**Abstract**: Despite the widespread adoption of industrial robots in automotive assembly, wire harness installation remains a largely manual process, as it requires precise and flexible manipulation. To address this challenge, we design a novel AI-based framework that automates cable connector mating by integrating force control with deep visuotactile learning. Our system optimizes search-and-insertion strategies using first-order optimization over a multimodal transformer architecture trained on visual, tactile, and proprioceptive data. Additionally, we design a novel automated data collection and optimization pipeline that minimizes the need for machine learning expertise. The framework optimizes robot programs that run natively on standard industrial controllers, permitting human experts to audit and certify them. Experimental validations on a center console assembly task demonstrate significant improvements in cycle times and robustness compared to conventional robot programming approaches.

# Multi-Agent Image Restoration 

**Authors**: Xu Jiang, Gehui Li, Bin Chen, Jian Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09403)  

**Abstract**: Image restoration (IR) is challenging due to the complexity of real-world degradations. While many specialized and all-in-one IR models have been developed, they fail to effectively handle complex, mixed degradations. Recent agentic methods RestoreAgent and AgenticIR leverage intelligent, autonomous workflows to alleviate this issue, yet they suffer from suboptimal results and inefficiency due to their resource-intensive finetunings, and ineffective searches and tool execution trials for satisfactory outputs. In this paper, we propose MAIR, a novel Multi-Agent approach for complex IR problems. We introduce a real-world degradation prior, categorizing degradations into three types: (1) scene, (2) imaging, and (3) compression, which are observed to occur sequentially in real world, and reverse them in the opposite order. Built upon this three-stage restoration framework, MAIR emulates a team of collaborative human specialists, including a "scheduler" for overall planning and multiple "experts" dedicated to specific degradations. This design minimizes search space and trial efforts, improving image quality while reducing inference costs. In addition, a registry mechanism is introduced to enable easy integration of new tools. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that proposed MAIR achieves competitive performance and improved efficiency over the previous agentic IR system. Code and models will be made available.

# ForAug: Recombining Foregrounds and Backgrounds to Improve Vision Transformer Training with Bias Mitigation 

**Authors**: Tobias Christian Nauen, Brian Moser, Federico Raue, Stanislav Frolov, Andreas Dengel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09399)  

**Abstract**: Transformers, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have achieved state-of-the-art performance in large-scale image classification. However, they often require large amounts of data and can exhibit biases that limit their robustness and generalizability. This paper introduces ForAug, a novel data augmentation scheme that addresses these challenges and explicitly includes inductive biases, which commonly are part of the neural network architecture, into the training data. ForAug is constructed by using pretrained foundation models to separate and recombine foreground objects with different backgrounds, enabling fine-grained control over image composition during training. It thus increases the data diversity and effective number of training samples. We demonstrate that training on ForNet, the application of ForAug to ImageNet, significantly improves the accuracy of ViTs and other architectures by up to 4.5 percentage points (p.p.) on ImageNet and 7.3 p.p. on downstream tasks. Importantly, ForAug enables novel ways of analyzing model behavior and quantifying biases. Namely, we introduce metrics for background robustness, foreground focus, center bias, and size bias and show that training on ForNet substantially reduces these biases compared to training on ImageNet. In summary, ForAug provides a valuable tool for analyzing and mitigating biases, enabling the development of more robust and reliable computer vision models. Our code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL.

# Close-up-GS: Enhancing Close-Up View Synthesis in 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Self-Training 

**Authors**: Jiatong Xia, Lingqiao Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09396)  

**Abstract**: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in synthesizing novel views after training on a given set of viewpoints. However, its rendering quality deteriorates when the synthesized view deviates significantly from the training views. This decline occurs due to (1) the model's difficulty in generalizing to out-of-distribution scenarios and (2) challenges in interpolating fine details caused by substantial resolution changes and occlusions. A notable case of this limitation is close-up view generation--producing views that are significantly closer to the object than those in the training set. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach for close-up view generation based by progressively training the 3DGS model with self-generated data. Our solution is based on three key ideas. First, we leverage the See3D model, a recently introduced 3D-aware generative model, to enhance the details of rendered views. Second, we propose a strategy to progressively expand the ``trust regions'' of the 3DGS model and update a set of reference views for See3D. Finally, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy to carefully update the 3DGS model with training data generated from the above schemes. We further define metrics for close-up views evaluation to facilitate better research on this problem. By conducting evaluations on specifically selected scenarios for close-up views, our proposed approach demonstrates a clear advantage over competitive solutions.

# Towards Next-Generation Recommender Systems: A Benchmark for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs 

**Authors**: Jiani Huang, Shijie Wang, Liang-bo Ning, Wenqi Fan, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Qing Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09382)  

**Abstract**: Recommender systems (RecSys) are widely used across various modern digital platforms and have garnered significant attention. Traditional recommender systems usually focus only on fixed and simple recommendation scenarios, making it difficult to generalize to new and unseen recommendation tasks in an interactive paradigm. Recently, the advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the foundational architecture of RecSys, driving their evolution into more intelligent and interactive personalized recommendation assistants. However, most existing studies rely on fixed task-specific prompt templates to generate recommendations and evaluate the performance of personalized assistants, which limits the comprehensive assessments of their capabilities. This is because commonly used datasets lack high-quality textual user queries that reflect real-world recommendation scenarios, making them unsuitable for evaluating LLM-based personalized recommendation assistants. To address this gap, we introduce RecBench+, a new dataset benchmark designed to access LLMs' ability to handle intricate user recommendation needs in the era of LLMs. RecBench+ encompasses a diverse set of queries that span both hard conditions and soft preferences, with varying difficulty levels. We evaluated commonly used LLMs on RecBench+ and uncovered below findings: 1) LLMs demonstrate preliminary abilities to act as recommendation assistants, 2) LLMs are better at handling queries with explicitly stated conditions, while facing challenges with queries that require reasoning or contain misleading information. Our dataset has been released at this https URL.

# Pig behavior dataset and Spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism for pig behavior recognition 

**Authors**: Fangzheng Qi, Zhenjie Hou, En Lin, Xing Li, iuzhen Liang, Xinwen Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09378)  

**Abstract**: The recognition of pig behavior plays a crucial role in smart farming and welfare assurance for pigs. Currently, in the field of pig behavior recognition, the lack of publicly available behavioral datasets not only limits the development of innovative algorithms but also hampers model robustness and algorithm this http URL paper proposes a dataset containing 13 pig behaviors that significantly impact this http URL on this dataset, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal perception and enhancement networks based on the attention mechanism to model the spatiotemporal features of pig behaviors and their associated interaction areas in video data. The network is composed of a spatiotemporal perception network and a spatiotemporal feature enhancement network. The spatiotemporal perception network is responsible for establishing connections between the pigs and the key regions of their behaviors in the video data. The spatiotemporal feature enhancement network further strengthens the important spatial features of individual pigs and captures the long-term dependencies of the spatiotemporal features of individual behaviors by remodeling these connections, thereby enhancing the model's perception of spatiotemporal changes in pig behaviors. Experimental results demonstrate that on the dataset established in this paper, our proposed model achieves a MAP score of 75.92%, which is an 8.17% improvement over the best-performing traditional model. This study not only improces the accuracy and generalizability of individual pig behavior recognition but also provides new technological tools for modern smart farming. The dataset and related code will be made publicly available alongside this paper.

# Revisiting Medical Image Retrieval via Knowledge Consolidation 

**Authors**: Yang Nan, Huichi Zhou, Xiaodan Xing, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Lei Zhu, Zhifan Gao, Alejandro F Fangi, Guang Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09370)  

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence and digital medicine increasingly permeate healthcare systems, robust governance frameworks are essential to ensure ethical, secure, and effective implementation. In this context, medical image retrieval becomes a critical component of clinical data management, playing a vital role in decision-making and safeguarding patient information. Existing methods usually learn hash functions using bottleneck features, which fail to produce representative hash codes from blended embeddings. Although contrastive hashing has shown superior performance, current approaches often treat image retrieval as a classification task, using category labels to create positive/negative pairs. Moreover, many methods fail to address the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue when models encounter external OOD queries or adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel method to consolidate knowledge of hierarchical features and optimisation functions. We formulate the knowledge consolidation by introducing Depth-aware Representation Fusion (DaRF) and Structure-aware Contrastive Hashing (SCH). DaRF adaptively integrates shallow and deep representations into blended features, and SCH incorporates image fingerprints to enhance the adaptability of positive/negative pairings. These blended features further facilitate OOD detection and content-based recommendation, contributing to a secure AI-driven healthcare environment. Moreover, we present a content-guided ranking to improve the robustness and reproducibility of retrieval results. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively recognise OOD samples and significantly outperform existing approaches in medical image retrieval (p<0.05). In particular, our method achieves a 5.6-38.9% improvement in mean Average Precision on the anatomical radiology dataset.

# Membership Inference Attacks fueled by Few-Short Learning to detect privacy leakage tackling data integrity 

**Authors**: Daniel Jiménez-López, Nuria Rodríguez-Barroso, M. Victoria Luzón, Francisco Herrera  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09365)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning models have an intrinsic privacy issue as they memorize parts of their training data, creating a privacy leakage. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) exploit it to obtain confidential information about the data used for training, aiming to steal information. They can be repurposed as a measurement of data integrity by inferring whether it was used to train a machine learning model. While state-of-the-art attacks achieve a significant privacy leakage, their requirements are not feasible enough, hindering their role as practical tools to assess the magnitude of the privacy risk. Moreover, the most appropriate evaluation metric of MIA, the True Positive Rate at low False Positive Rate lacks interpretability. We claim that the incorporation of Few-Shot Learning techniques to the MIA field and a proper qualitative and quantitative privacy evaluation measure should deal with these issues. In this context, our proposal is twofold. We propose a Few-Shot learning based MIA, coined as the FeS-MIA model, which eases the evaluation of the privacy breach of a deep learning model by significantly reducing the number of resources required for the purpose. Furthermore, we propose an interpretable quantitative and qualitative measure of privacy, referred to as Log-MIA measure. Jointly, these proposals provide new tools to assess the privacy leakage and to ease the evaluation of the training data integrity of deep learning models, that is, to analyze the privacy breach of a deep learning model. Experiments carried out with MIA over image classification and language modeling tasks and its comparison to the state-of-the-art show that our proposals excel at reporting the privacy leakage of a deep learning model with little extra information.

# RetSTA: An LLM-Based Approach for Standardizing Clinical Fundus Image Reports 

**Authors**: Jiushen Cai, Weihang Zhang, Hanruo Liu, Ningli Wang, Huiqi Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09358)  

**Abstract**: Standardization of clinical reports is crucial for improving the quality of healthcare and facilitating data integration. The lack of unified standards, including format, terminology, and style, is a great challenge in clinical fundus diagnostic reports, which increases the difficulty for large language models (LLMs) to understand the data. To address this, we construct a bilingual standard terminology, containing fundus clinical terms and commonly used descriptions in clinical diagnosis. Then, we establish two models, RetSTA-7B-Zero and RetSTA-7B. RetSTA-7B-Zero, fine-tuned on an augmented dataset simulating clinical scenarios, demonstrates powerful standardization behaviors. However, it encounters a challenge of limitation to cover a wider range of diseases. To further enhance standardization performance, we build RetSTA-7B, which integrates a substantial amount of standardized data generated by RetSTA-7B-Zero along with corresponding English data, covering diverse complex clinical scenarios and achieving report-level standardization for the first time. Experimental results demonstrate that RetSTA-7B outperforms other compared LLMs in bilingual standardization task, which validates its superior performance and generalizability. The checkpoints are available at this https URL.

# Automatic Operator-level Parallelism Planning for Distributed Deep Learning -- A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach 

**Authors**: Ruifeng She, Bowen Pang, Kai Li, Zehua Liu, Tao Zhong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09357)  

**Abstract**: As the artificial intelligence community advances into the era of large models with billions of parameters, distributed training and inference have become essential. While various parallelism strategies-data, model, sequence, and pipeline-have been successfully implemented for popular neural networks on main-stream hardware, optimizing the distributed deployment schedule requires extensive expertise and manual effort. Further more, while existing frameworks with most simple chain-like structures, they struggle with complex non-linear architectures. Mixture-of-experts and multi-modal models feature intricate MIMO and branch-rich topologies that require fine-grained operator-level parallelization beyond the capabilities of existing frameworks. We propose formulating parallelism planning as a scheduling optimization problem using mixed-integer programming. We propose a bi-level solution framework balancing optimality with computational efficiency, automatically generating effective distributed plans that capture both the heterogeneous structure of modern neural networks and the underlying hardware constraints. In experiments comparing against expert-designed strategies like DeepSeek's DualPipe, our framework achieves comparable or superior performance, reducing computational bubbles by half under the same memory constraints. The framework's versatility extends beyond throughput optimization to incorporate hardware utilization maximization, memory capacity constraints, and other considerations or potential strategies. Such capabilities position our solution as both a valuable research tool for exploring optimal parallelization strategies and a practical industrial solution for large-scale AI deployment.

# MOAT: Evaluating LMMs for Capability Integration and Instruction Grounding 

**Authors**: Zhoutong Ye, Mingze Sun, Huan-ang Gao, Chun Yu, Yuanchun Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09348)  

**Abstract**: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential as generalists in vision-language (VL) tasks. However, there remains a significant gap between state-of-the-art LMMs and human performance when it comes to complex tasks that require a combination of fundamental VL capabilities, as well as tasks involving the grounding of complex instructions. To thoroughly investigate the human-LMM gap and its underlying causes, we propose MOAT, a diverse benchmark with complex real-world VL tasks that are challenging for LMMs. Specifically, the tasks in MOAT require LMMs to engage in generalist problem solving by integrating fundamental VL capabilities such as reading text, counting, understanding spatial relations, grounding textual and visual instructions, etc. All these abilities fit into a taxonomy proposed by us that contains 10 fundamental VL capabilities, enabling MOAT to provide a fine-grained view of LMMs' strengths and weaknesses. Besides, MOAT is the first benchmark to explicitly evaluate LMMs' ability to ground complex text and visual instructions, which is essential to many real-world applications. We evaluate over 20 proprietary and open source LMMs, as well as humans, on MOAT, and found that humans achieved 82.7% accuracy while the best performing LMM (OpenAI o1) achieved only 38.8%. To guide future model development, we analyze common trends in our results and discuss the underlying causes of observed performance gaps between LMMs and humans, focusing on which VL capability forms the bottleneck in complex tasks, whether test time scaling improves performance on MOAT, and how tiling harms LMMs' capability to count. Code and data are available at this https URL.

# Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts 

**Authors**: Hongyu Chen, Seraphina Goldfarb-Tarrant  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09347)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.

# NVP-HRI: Zero Shot Natural Voice and Posture-based Human-Robot Interaction via Large Language Model 

**Authors**: Yuzhi Lai, Shenghai Yuan, Youssef Nassar, Mingyu Fan, Thomas Weber, Matthias Rätsch  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09335)  

**Abstract**: Effective Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is crucial for future service robots in aging societies. Existing solutions are biased toward only well-trained objects, creating a gap when dealing with new objects. Currently, HRI systems using predefined gestures or language tokens for pretrained objects pose challenges for all individuals, especially elderly ones. These challenges include difficulties in recalling commands, memorizing hand gestures, and learning new names. This paper introduces NVP-HRI, an intuitive multi-modal HRI paradigm that combines voice commands and deictic posture. NVP-HRI utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to analyze visual cues and depth data, enabling precise structural object representation. Through a pre-trained SAM network, NVP-HRI allows interaction with new objects via zero-shot prediction, even without prior knowledge. NVP-HRI also integrates with a large language model (LLM) for multimodal commands, coordinating them with object selection and scene distribution in real time for collision-free trajectory solutions. We also regulate the action sequence with the essential control syntax to reduce LLM hallucination risks. The evaluation of diverse real-world tasks using a Universal Robot showcased up to 59.2\% efficiency improvement over traditional gesture control, as illustrated in the video this https URL. Our code and design will be openly available at this https URL.

# CyberLLMInstruct: A New Dataset for Analysing Safety of Fine-Tuned LLMs Using Cyber Security Data 

**Authors**: Adel ElZemity, Budi Arief, Shujun Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09334)  

**Abstract**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into cyber security applications presents significant opportunities, such as enhancing threat analysis and malware detection, but can also introduce critical risks and safety concerns, including personal data leakage and automated generation of new malware. To address these challenges, we developed CyberLLMInstruct, a dataset of 54,928 instruction-response pairs spanning cyber security tasks such as malware analysis, phishing simulations, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The dataset was constructed through a multi-stage process. This involved sourcing data from multiple resources, filtering and structuring it into instruction-response pairs, and aligning it with real-world scenarios to enhance its applicability. Seven open-source LLMs were chosen to test the usefulness of CyberLLMInstruct: Phi 3 Mini 3.8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Llama 3 8B, Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Llama 2 70B. In our primary example, we rigorously assess the safety of fine-tuned models using the OWASP top 10 framework, finding that fine-tuning reduces safety resilience across all tested LLMs and every adversarial attack (e.g., the security score of Llama 3.1 8B against prompt injection drops from 0.95 to 0.15). In our second example, we show that these same fine-tuned models can also achieve up to 92.50 percent accuracy on the CyberMetric benchmark. These findings highlight a trade-off between performance and safety, showing the importance of adversarial testing and further research into fine-tuning methodologies that can mitigate safety risks while still improving performance across diverse datasets and domains. All scripts required to reproduce the dataset, along with examples and relevant resources for replicating our results, will be made available upon the paper's acceptance.

# SDD-4DGS: Static-Dynamic Aware Decoupling in Gaussian Splatting for 4D Scene Reconstruction 

**Authors**: Dai Sun, Huhao Guan, Kun Zhang, Xike Xie, S. Kevin Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09332)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic and static components in scenes often exhibit distinct properties, yet most 4D reconstruction methods treat them indiscriminately, leading to suboptimal performance in both cases. This work introduces SDD-4DGS, the first framework for static-dynamic decoupled 4D scene reconstruction based on Gaussian Splatting. Our approach is built upon a novel probabilistic dynamic perception coefficient that is naturally integrated into the Gaussian reconstruction pipeline, enabling adaptive separation of static and dynamic components. With carefully designed implementation strategies to realize this theoretical framework, our method effectively facilitates explicit learning of motion patterns for dynamic elements while maintaining geometric stability for static structures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDD-4DGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction fidelity, with enhanced detail restoration for static structures and precise modeling of dynamic motions. The code will be released.

# Group-robust Machine Unlearning 

**Authors**: Thomas De Min, Subhankar Roy, Stéphane Lathuilière, Elisa Ricci, Massimiliano Mancini  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09330)  

**Abstract**: Machine unlearning is an emerging paradigm to remove the influence of specific training data (i.e., the forget set) from a model while preserving its knowledge of the rest of the data (i.e., the retain set). Previous approaches assume the forget data to be uniformly distributed from all training datapoints. However, if the data to unlearn is dominant in one group, we empirically show that performance for this group degrades, leading to fairness issues. This work tackles the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed forget sets, which we call group-robust machine unlearning, by presenting a simple, effective strategy that mitigates the performance loss in dominant groups via sample distribution reweighting. Moreover, we present MIU (Mutual Information-aware Machine Unlearning), the first approach for group robustness in approximate machine unlearning. MIU minimizes the mutual information between model features and group information, achieving unlearning while reducing performance degradation in the dominant group of the forget set. Additionally, MIU exploits sample distribution reweighting and mutual information calibration with the original model to preserve group robustness. We conduct experiments on three datasets and show that MIU outperforms standard methods, achieving unlearning without compromising model robustness. Source code available at this https URL.

# A Survey on Enhancing Causal Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Xin Li, Zhuo Cai, Shoujin Wang, Kun Yu, Fang Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09326)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in language tasks and beyond. However, due to their limited inherent causal reasoning ability, LLMs still face challenges in handling tasks that require robust causal reasoning ability, such as health-care and economic analysis. As a result, a growing body of research has focused on enhancing the causal reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the booming research, there lacks a survey to well review the challenges, progress and future directions in this area. To bridge this significant gap, we systematically review literature on how to strengthen LLMs' causal reasoning ability in this paper. We start from the introduction of background and motivations of this topic, followed by the summarisation of key challenges in this area. Thereafter, we propose a novel taxonomy to systematically categorise existing methods, together with detailed comparisons within and between classes of methods. Furthermore, we summarise existing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for assessing LLMs' causal reasoning ability. Finally, we outline future research directions for this emerging field, offering insights and inspiration to researchers and practitioners in the area.

# DAVE: Diagnostic benchmark for Audio Visual Evaluation 

**Authors**: Gorjan Radevski, Teodora Popordanoska, Matthew B. Blaschko, Tinne Tuytelaars  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09321)  

**Abstract**: Audio-visual understanding is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to integrate and interpret information from both auditory and visual modalities. Despite recent advances in multi-modal learning, existing benchmarks often suffer from strong visual bias -- where answers can be inferred from visual data alone -- and provide only aggregate scores that conflate multiple sources of error. This makes it difficult to determine whether models struggle with visual understanding, audio interpretation, or audio-visual alignment. In this work, we introduce DAVE (Diagnostic Audio Visual Evaluation), a novel benchmark dataset designed to systematically evaluate audio-visual models across controlled challenges. DAVE alleviates existing limitations by (i) ensuring both modalities are necessary to answer correctly and (ii) decoupling evaluation into atomic subcategories. Our detailed analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals specific failure modes and provides targeted insights for improvement. By offering this standardized diagnostic framework, we aim to facilitate more robust development of audio-visual models. The dataset is released: this https URL

# Adaptive political surveys and GPT-4: Tackling the cold start problem with simulated user interactions 

**Authors**: Fynn Bachmann, Daan van der Weijden, Lucien Heitz, Cristina Sarasua, Abraham Bernstein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09311)  

**Abstract**: Adaptive questionnaires dynamically select the next question for a survey participant based on their previous answers. Due to digitalisation, they have become a viable alternative to traditional surveys in application areas such as political science. One limitation, however, is their dependency on data to train the model for question selection. Often, such training data (i.e., user interactions) are unavailable a priori. To address this problem, we (i) test whether Large Language Models (LLM) can accurately generate such interaction data and (ii) explore if these synthetic data can be used to pre-train the statistical model of an adaptive political survey. To evaluate this approach, we utilise existing data from the Swiss Voting Advice Application (VAA) Smartvote in two ways: First, we compare the distribution of LLM-generated synthetic data to the real distribution to assess its similarity. Second, we compare the performance of an adaptive questionnaire that is randomly initialised with one pre-trained on synthetic data to assess their suitability for training. We benchmark these results against an "oracle" questionnaire with perfect prior knowledge. We find that an off-the-shelf LLM (GPT-4) accurately generates answers to the Smartvote questionnaire from the perspective of different Swiss parties. Furthermore, we demonstrate that initialising the statistical model with synthetic data can (i) significantly reduce the error in predicting user responses and (ii) increase the candidate recommendation accuracy of the VAA. Our work emphasises the considerable potential of LLMs to create training data to improve the data collection process in adaptive questionnaires in LLM-affine areas such as political surveys.

# Steering No-Regret Agents in MFGs under Model Uncertainty 

**Authors**: Leo Widmer, Jiawei Huang, Niao He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09309)  

**Abstract**: Incentive design is a popular framework for guiding agents' learning dynamics towards desired outcomes by providing additional payments beyond intrinsic rewards. However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the desired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty.

**Authors**: Somsubhra De, Advait Vats  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09289)  

**Abstract**: The rise of Generative AI has led to a surge in AI-generated reviews, often posing a serious threat to the credibility of online platforms. Reviews serve as the primary source of information about products and services. Authentic reviews play a vital role in consumer decision-making. The presence of fabricated content misleads consumers, undermines trust and facilitates potential fraud in digital marketplaces. This study focuses on detecting AI-generated product reviews in Tamil and Malayalam, two low-resource languages where research in this domain is relatively under-explored. We worked on a range of approaches - from traditional machine learning methods to advanced transformer-based models such as Indic-BERT, IndicSBERT, MuRIL, XLM-RoBERTa and MalayalamBERT. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of leveraging the state-of-the-art transformers in accurately identifying AI-generated content, demonstrating the potential in enhancing the detection of fake reviews in low-resource language settings.

**Authors**: Haoxuan Wang, Jinlong Peng, Qingdong He, Hao Yang, Ying Jin, Jiafu Wu, Xiaobin Hu, Yanjie Pan, Zhenye Gan, Mingmin Chi, Bo Peng, Yabiao Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09277)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of diffusion models in image generation, the demand for more powerful and flexible controllable frameworks is increasing. Although existing methods can guide generation beyond text prompts, the challenge of effectively combining multiple conditional inputs while maintaining consistency with all of them remains unsolved. To address this, we introduce UniCombine, a DiT-based multi-conditional controllable generative framework capable of handling any combination of conditions, including but not limited to text prompts, spatial maps, and subject images. Specifically, we introduce a novel Conditional MMDiT Attention mechanism and incorporate a trainable LoRA module to build both the training-free and training-based versions. Additionally, we propose a new pipeline to construct SubjectSpatial200K, the first dataset designed for multi-conditional generative tasks covering both the subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditions. Extensive experimental results on multi-conditional generation demonstrate the outstanding universality and powerful capability of our approach with state-of-the-art performance.

# Single-Qudit Quantum Neural Networks for Multiclass Classification 

**Authors**: Leandro C. Souza, Renato Portugal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09269)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a single-qudit quantum neural network for multiclass classification, by using the enhanced representational capacity of high-dimensional qudit states. Our design employs an $d$-dimensional unitary operator, where $d$ corresponds to the number of classes, constructed using the Cayley transform of a skew-symmetric matrix, to efficiently encode and process class information. This architecture enables a direct mapping between class labels and quantum measurement outcomes, reducing circuit depth and computational overhead. To optimize network parameters, we introduce a hybrid training approach that combines an extended activation function -- derived from a truncated multivariable Taylor series expansion -- with support vector machine optimization for weight determination. We evaluate our model on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets, demonstrating competitive accuracy while maintaining a compact single-qudit quantum circuit. Our findings highlight the potential of qudit-based QNNs as scalable alternatives to classical deep learning models, particularly for multiclass classification. However, practical implementation remains constrained by current quantum hardware limitations. This research advances quantum machine learning by demonstrating the feasibility of higher-dimensional quantum systems for efficient learning tasks.

# SCOPE-DTI: Semi-Inductive Dataset Construction and Framework Optimization for Practical Usability Enhancement in Deep Learning-Based Drug Target Interaction Prediction 

**Authors**: Yigang Chen, Xiang Ji, Ziyue Zhang, Yuming Zhou, Yang-Chi-Dung Lin, Hsi-Yuan Huang, Tao Zhang, Yi Lai, Ke Chen, Chang Su, Xingqiao Lin, Zihao Zhu, Yanggyi Zhang, Kangping Wei, Jiehui Fu, Yixian Huang, Shidong Cui, Shih-Chung Yen, Ariel Warshel, Hsien-Da Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09251)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning-based drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods have demonstrated strong performance; however, real-world applicability remains constrained by limited data diversity and modeling complexity. To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.

# Considering Length Diversity in Retrieval-Augmented Summarization 

**Authors**: Juseon-Do, Jaesung Hwang, Jingun Kwon, Hidetaka Kamigaito, Manabu Okumura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09249)  

**Abstract**: This study investigates retrieval-augmented summarization by specifically examining the impact of exemplar summary lengths under length constraints, not covered by previous work. We propose a Diverse Length-aware Maximal Marginal Relevance (DL-MMR) algorithm to better control summary lengths. This algorithm combines the query relevance with diverse target lengths in retrieval-augmented summarization. Unlike previous methods that necessitate exhaustive exemplar exemplar relevance comparisons using MMR, DL-MMR considers the exemplar target length as well and avoids comparing exemplars to each other, thereby reducing computational cost and conserving memory during the construction of an exemplar pool. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of DL-MMR, which considers length diversity, compared to the original MMR algorithm. DL-MMR additionally showed the effectiveness in memory saving of 781,513 times and computational cost reduction of 500,092 times, while maintaining the same level of informativeness.

# LREF: A Novel LLM-based Relevance Framework for E-commerce 

**Authors**: Tian Tang, Zhixing Tian, Zhenyu Zhu, Chenyang Wang, Haiqing Hu, Guoyu Tang, Lin Liu, Sulong Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09223)  

**Abstract**: Query and product relevance prediction is a critical component for ensuring a smooth user experience in e-commerce search. Traditional studies mainly focus on BERT-based models to assess the semantic relevance between queries and products. However, the discriminative paradigm and limited knowledge capacity of these approaches restrict their ability to comprehend the relevance between queries and products fully. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent research has begun to explore their application to industrial search systems, as LLMs provide extensive world knowledge and flexible optimization for reasoning processes. Nonetheless, directly leveraging LLMs for relevance prediction tasks introduces new challenges, including a high demand for data quality, the necessity for meticulous optimization of reasoning processes, and an optimistic bias that can result in over-recall. To overcome the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called the LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) aimed at enhancing e-commerce search relevance. The framework comprises three main stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with Data Selection, Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for de-biasing. We evaluate the performance of the framework through a series of offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, as well as online A/B testing. The results indicate significant improvements in both offline and online metrics. Ultimately, the model was deployed in a well-known e-commerce application, yielding substantial commercial benefits.

# Evaluating the Generalizability of LLMs in Automated Program Repair 

**Authors**: Fengjie Li, Jiajun Jiang, Jiajun Sun, Hongyu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09217)  

**Abstract**: LLM-based automated program repair methods have attracted significant attention for their state-of-the-art performance. However, they were primarily evaluated on a few well known datasets like Defects4J, raising questions about their effectiveness on new datasets. In this study, we evaluate 11 top-performing LLMs on DEFECTS4J-TRANS, a new dataset derived from transforming Defects4J while maintaining the original semantics. Results from experiments on both Defects4J and DEFECTS4J-TRANS show that all studied LLMs have limited generalizability in APR tasks, with the average number of correct and plausible patches decreasing by 49.48% and 42.90%, respectively, on DEFECTS4J-TRANS. Further investigation into incorporating additional repair-relevant information in repair prompts reveals that, although this information significantly enhances the LLMs' capabilities (increasing the number of correct and plausible patches by up to 136.67% and 121.82%, respectively), performance still falls short of their original results. This indicates that prompt engineering alone is insufficient to substantially enhance LLMs' repair capabilities. Based on our study, we also offer several recommendations for future research.

# Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latant Space 

**Authors**: Jian Zhu, Zhengyu Jia, Tian Gao, Jiaxin Deng, Shidi Li, Fu Liu, Peng Jia, Xianpeng Lang, Xiaolong Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09215)  

**Abstract**: Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving \textbf{W}orld \textbf{M}odel named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying \textbf{E}go-\textbf{O}ther vehicle \textbf{T}rajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30\% in FID and 55\% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.

# Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Corrupted Clients 

**Authors**: Xiuwen Fang, Mang Ye, Bo Du  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09206)  

**Abstract**: This paper studies a challenging robust federated learning task with model heterogeneous and data corrupted clients, where the clients have different local model structures. Data corruption is unavoidable due to factors such as random noise, compression artifacts, or environmental conditions in real-world deployment, drastically crippling the entire federated system. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel Robust Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning (RAHFL) framework. We propose a Diversity-enhanced supervised Contrastive Learning technique to enhance the resilience and adaptability of local models on various data corruption patterns. Its basic idea is to utilize complex augmented samples obtained by the mixed-data augmentation strategy for supervised contrastive learning, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to learn robust and diverse feature representations. Furthermore, we design an Asymmetric Heterogeneous Federated Learning strategy to resist corrupt feedback from external clients. The strategy allows clients to perform selective one-way learning during collaborative learning phase, enabling clients to refrain from incorporating lower-quality information from less robust or underperforming collaborators. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in diverse, challenging federated learning environments. Our code and models are public available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Giovanni Bocchi, Patrizio Frosini, Alessandra Micheletti, Alessandro Pedretti, Carmen Gratteri, Filippo Lunghini, Andrea Rosario Beccari, Carmine Talarico  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09199)  

**Abstract**: Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as mathematical tools for constructing networks for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Recent findings suggest that such models can be inserted within the domain of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) due to their inherent interpretability. In this study, we aim to verify this claim with respect to GENEOnet, a GENEO network developed for an application in computational biochemistry by employing various statistical analyses and experiments. Such experiments first allow us to perform a sensitivity analysis on GENEOnet's parameters to test their significance. Subsequently, we show that GENEOnet exhibits a significantly higher proportion of equivariance compared to other methods. Lastly, we demonstrate that GENEOnet is on average robust to perturbations arising from molecular dynamics. These results collectively serve as proof of the explainability, trustworthiness, and robustness of GENEOnet and confirm the beneficial use of GENEOs in the context of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence.

# Long-Term Planning Around Humans in Domestic Environments with 3D Scene Graphs 

**Authors**: Ermanno Bartoli, Dennis Rotondi, Kai O. Arras, Iolanda Leite  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09173)  

**Abstract**: Long-term planning for robots operating in domestic environments poses unique challenges due to the interactions between humans, objects, and spaces. Recent advancements in trajectory planning have leveraged vision-language models (VLMs) to extract contextual information for robots operating in real-world environments. While these methods achieve satisfying performance, they do not explicitly model human activities. Such activities influence surrounding objects and reshape spatial constraints. This paper presents a novel approach to trajectory planning that integrates human preferences, activities, and spatial context through an enriched 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation. By incorporating activity-based relationships, our method captures the spatial impact of human actions, leading to more context-sensitive trajectory adaptation. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach effectively assigns costs to spaces influenced by human activities, ensuring that the robot trajectory remains contextually appropriate and sensitive to the ongoing environment. This balance between task efficiency and social appropriateness enhances context-aware human-robot interactions in domestic settings. Future work includes implementing a full planning pipeline and conducting user studies to evaluate trajectory acceptability.

# Is LLMs Hallucination Usable? LLM-based Negative Reasoning for Fake News Detection 

**Authors**: Chaowei Zhang, Zongling Feng, Zewei Zhang, Jipeng Qiang, Guandong Xu, Yun Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09153)  

**Abstract**: The questionable responses caused by knowledge hallucination may lead to LLMs' unstable ability in decision-making. However, it has never been investigated whether the LLMs' hallucination is possibly usable to generate negative reasoning for facilitating the detection of fake news. This study proposes a novel supervised self-reinforced reasoning rectification approach - SR$^3$ that yields both common reasonable reasoning and wrong understandings (negative reasoning) for news via LLMs reflection for semantic consistency learning. Upon that, we construct a negative reasoning-based news learning model called - \emph{NRFE}, which leverages positive or negative news-reasoning pairs for learning the semantic consistency between them. To avoid the impact of label-implicated reasoning, we deploy a student model - \emph{NRFE-D} that only takes news content as input to inspect the performance of our method by distilling the knowledge from \emph{NRFE}. The experimental results verified on three popular fake news datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with three kinds of baselines including prompting on LLMs, fine-tuning on pre-trained SLMs, and other representative fake news detection methods.

# Reangle-A-Video: 4D Video Generation as Video-to-Video Translation 

**Authors**: Hyeonho Jeong, Suhyeon Lee, Jong Chul Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09151)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Reangle-A-Video, a unified framework for generating synchronized multi-view videos from a single input video. Unlike mainstream approaches that train multi-view video diffusion models on large-scale 4D datasets, our method reframes the multi-view video generation task as video-to-videos translation, leveraging publicly available image and video diffusion priors. In essence, Reangle-A-Video operates in two stages. (1) Multi-View Motion Learning: An image-to-video diffusion transformer is synchronously fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner to distill view-invariant motion from a set of warped videos. (2) Multi-View Consistent Image-to-Images Translation: The first frame of the input video is warped and inpainted into various camera perspectives under an inference-time cross-view consistency guidance using DUSt3R, generating multi-view consistent starting images. Extensive experiments on static view transport and dynamic camera control show that Reangle-A-Video surpasses existing methods, establishing a new solution for multi-view video generation. We will publicly release our code and data. Project page: this https URL

# Efficient UAV Swarm-Based Multi-Task Federated Learning with Dynamic Task Knowledge Sharing 

**Authors**: Yubo Yang, Tao Yang, Xiaofeng Wu, Ziyu Guo, Bo Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09144)  

**Abstract**: UAV swarms are widely used in emergency communications, area monitoring, and disaster relief. Coordinated by control centers, they are ideal for federated learning (FL) frameworks. However, current UAV-assisted FL methods primarily focus on single tasks, overlooking the need for multi-task training. In disaster relief scenarios, UAVs perform tasks such as crowd detection, road feasibility analysis, and disaster assessment, which exhibit time-varying demands and potential correlations. In order to meet the time-varying requirements of tasks and complete multiple tasks efficiently under resource constraints, in this paper, we propose a UAV swarm based multi-task FL framework, where ground emergency vehicles (EVs) collaborate with UAVs to accomplish multiple tasks efficiently under constrained energy and bandwidth resources. Through theoretical analysis, we identify key factors affecting task performance and introduce a task attention mechanism to dynamically evaluate task importance, thereby achieving efficient resource allocation. Additionally, we propose a task affinity (TA) metric to capture the dynamic correlation among tasks, thereby promoting task knowledge sharing to accelerate training and improve the generalization ability of the model in different scenarios. To optimize resource allocation, we formulate a two-layer optimization problem to jointly optimize UAV transmission power, computation frequency, bandwidth allocation, and UAV-EV associations. For the inner problem, we derive closed-form solutions for transmission power, computation frequency, and bandwidth allocation and apply a block coordinate descent method for optimization. For the outer problem, a two-stage algorithm is designed to determine optimal UAV-EV associations. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals a trade-off between UAV energy consumption and multi-task performance.

# Investigation of Frame Differences as Motion Cues for Video Object Segmentation 

**Authors**: Sota Kawamura, Hirotada Honda, Shugo Nakamura, Takashi Sano  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09132)  

**Abstract**: Automatic Video Object Segmentation (AVOS) refers to the task of autonomously segmenting target objects in video sequences without relying on human-provided annotations in the first frames. In AVOS, the use of motion information is crucial, with optical flow being a commonly employed method for capturing motion cues. However, the computation of optical flow is resource-intensive, making it unsuitable for real-time applications, especially on edge devices with limited computational resources. In this study, we propose using frame differences as an alternative to optical flow for motion cue extraction. We developed an extended U-Net-like AVOS model that takes a frame on which segmentation is performed and a frame difference as inputs, and outputs an estimated segmentation map. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves performance comparable to the model with optical flow as an input, particularly when applied to videos captured by stationary cameras. Our results suggest the usefulness of employing frame differences as motion cues in cases with limited computational resources.

# On the Internal Representations of Graph Metanetworks 

**Authors**: Taesun Yeom, Jaeho Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09120)  

**Abstract**: Weight space learning is an emerging paradigm in the deep learning community. The primary goal of weight space learning is to extract informative features from a set of parameters using specially designed neural networks, often referred to as \emph{metanetworks}. However, it remains unclear how these metanetworks learn solely from parameters. To address this, we take the first step toward understanding \emph{representations} of metanetworks, specifically graph metanetworks (GMNs), which achieve state-of-the-art results in this field, using centered kernel alignment (CKA). Through various experiments, we reveal that GMNs and general neural networks (\textit{e.g.,} multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs)) differ in terms of their representation space.

# Sometimes Painful but Certainly Promising: Feasibility and Trade-offs of Language Model Inference at the Edge 

**Authors**: Maximilian Abstreiter, Sasu Tarkoma, Roberto Morabito  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09114)  

**Abstract**: The rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) has expanded the capabilities of natural language processing, powering applications from text generation to complex decision-making. While state-of-the-art LMs often boast hundreds of billions of parameters and are primarily deployed in data centers, recent trends show a growing focus on compact models-typically under 10 billion parameters-enabled by techniques such as quantization and other model compression techniques. This shift paves the way for LMs on edge devices, offering potential benefits such as enhanced privacy, reduced latency, and improved data sovereignty. However, the inherent complexity of even these smaller models, combined with the limited computing resources of edge hardware, raises critical questions about the practical trade-offs in executing LM inference outside the cloud. To address these challenges, we present a comprehensive evaluation of generative LM inference on representative CPU-based and GPU-accelerated edge devices. Our study measures key performance indicators-including memory usage, inference speed, and energy consumption-across various device configurations. Additionally, we examine throughput-energy trade-offs, cost considerations, and usability, alongside an assessment of qualitative model performance. While quantization helps mitigate memory overhead, it does not fully eliminate resource bottlenecks, especially for larger models. Our findings quantify the memory and energy constraints that must be considered for practical real-world deployments, offering concrete insights into the trade-offs between model size, inference performance, and efficiency. The exploration of LMs at the edge is still in its early stages. We hope this study provides a foundation for future research, guiding the refinement of models, the enhancement of inference efficiency, and the advancement of edge-centric AI systems.

# Constraint-Guided Learning of Data-driven Health Indicator Models: An Application on the Pronostia Bearing Dataset 

**Authors**: Yonas Tefera, Quinten Van Baelen, Maarten Meire, Stijn Luca, Peter Karsmakers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09113)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a constraint-guided deep learning framework for developing physically consistent health indicators in bearing prognostics and health management. Conventional data-driven methods often lack physical plausibility, while physics-based models are limited by incomplete system knowledge. To address this, we integrate domain knowledge into deep learning using constraints to enforce monotonicity, bound output values between 1 and 0 (representing healthy to failed states), and ensure consistency between signal energy trends and health indicator estimates. This eliminates the need for complex loss term balancing. We implement constraint-guided gradient descent within an autoencoder architecture, creating a constrained autoencoder. However, the framework is adaptable to other architectures. Using time-frequency representations of accelerometer signals from the Pronostia dataset, our constrained model generates smoother, more reliable degradation profiles compared to conventional methods, aligning with expected physical behavior. Performance is assessed using three metrics: trendability, robustness, and consistency. Compared to a conventional baseline, the constrained model improves all three. Another baseline, incorporating monotonicity via a soft-ranking loss function, outperforms in trendability but falls short in robustness and consistency. An ablation study confirms that the monotonicity constraint enhances trendability, the boundary constraint ensures consistency, and the energy-health consistency constraint improves robustness. These findings highlight the effectiveness of constraint-guided deep learning in producing reliable, physically meaningful health indicators, offering a promising direction for future prognostic applications.

# Freeze and Cluster: A Simple Baseline for Rehearsal-Free Continual Category Discovery 

**Authors**: Chuyu Zhang, Xueyang Yu, Peiyan Gu, Xuming He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09106)  

**Abstract**: This paper addresses the problem of Rehearsal-Free Continual Category Discovery (RF-CCD), which focuses on continuously identifying novel class by leveraging knowledge from labeled data. Existing methods typically train from scratch, overlooking the potential of base models, and often resort to data storage to prevent forgetting. Moreover, because RF-CCD encompasses both continual learning and novel class discovery, previous approaches have struggled to effectively integrate advanced techniques from these fields, resulting in less convincing comparisons and failing to reveal the unique challenges posed by RF-CCD. To address these challenges, we lead the way in integrating advancements from both domains and conducting extensive experiments and analyses. Our findings demonstrate that this integration can achieve state-of-the-art results, leading to the conclusion that in the presence of pre-trained models, the representation does not improve and may even degrade with the introduction of unlabeled data. To mitigate representation degradation, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective baseline method. This method first utilizes prior knowledge of known categories to estimate the number of novel classes. It then acquires representations using a model specifically trained on the base classes, generates high-quality pseudo-labels through k-means clustering, and trains only the classifier layer. We validate our conclusions and methods by conducting extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, including the Stanford Cars, CUB, iNat, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. The results clearly illustrate our findings, demonstrate the effectiveness of our baseline, and pave the way for future advancements in RF-CCD.

# The Shape of Attraction in UMAP: Exploring the Embedding Forces in Dimensionality Reduction 

**Authors**: Mohammad Tariqul Islam, Jason W. Fleischer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09101)  

**Abstract**: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is among the most popular neighbor embedding methods. The method relies on attractive and repulsive forces among high-dimensional data points to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. In this paper, we analyze the forces to reveal their effects on cluster formations and visualization. Repulsion emphasizes differences, controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our analysis makes UMAP and similar embedding methods more interpretable, more robust, and more accurate.

# Multi-Modal Foundation Models for Computational Pathology: A Survey 

**Authors**: Dong Li, Guihong Wan, Xintao Wu, Xinyu Wu, Xiaohui Chen, Yi He, Christine G. Lian, Peter K. Sorger, Yevgeniy R. Semenov, Chen Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09091)  

**Abstract**: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in computational pathology (CPath), enabling scalable and generalizable analysis of histopathological images. While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.

**Authors**: Zhaoling Chen, Xiangru Tang, Gangda Deng, Fang Wu, Jialong Wu, Zhiwei Jiang, Viktor Prasanna, Arman Cohan, Xingyao Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09089)  

**Abstract**: Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

# Everything Can Be Described in Words: A Simple Unified Multi-Modal Framework with Semantic and Temporal Alignment 

**Authors**: Xiaowei Bi, Zheyuan Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09081)  

**Abstract**: Long Video Question Answering (LVQA) is challenging due to the need for temporal reasoning and large-scale multimodal data processing. Existing methods struggle with retrieving cross-modal information from long videos, especially when relevant details are sparsely distributed. We introduce UMaT (Unified Multi-modal as Text), a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that efficiently processes extremely long videos while maintaining cross-modal coherence. UMaT converts visual and auditory data into a unified textual representation, ensuring semantic and temporal alignment. Short video clips are analyzed using a vision-language model, while automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes dialogue. These text-based representations are structured into temporally aligned segments, with adaptive filtering to remove redundancy and retain salient details. The processed data is embedded into a vector database, enabling precise retrieval of dispersed yet relevant content. Experiments on a benchmark LVQA dataset show that UMaT outperforms existing methods in multimodal integration, long-form video understanding, and sparse information retrieval. Its scalability and interpretability allow it to process videos over an hour long while maintaining semantic and temporal coherence. These findings underscore the importance of structured retrieval and multimodal synchronization for advancing LVQA and long-form AI systems.

# Theoretical Guarantees for High Order Trajectory Refinement in Generative Flows 

**Authors**: Chengyue Gong, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yu Tian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09069)  

**Abstract**: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, offering computational advantages over diffusion models by leveraging deterministic Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) instead of stochastic dynamics. While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.

# Probing Network Decisions: Capturing Uncertainties and Unveiling Vulnerabilities Without Label Information 

**Authors**: Youngju Joung, Sehyun Lee, Jaesik Choi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09068)  

**Abstract**: To improve trust and transparency, it is crucial to be able to interpret the decisions of Deep Neural classifiers (DNNs). Instance-level examinations, such as attribution techniques, are commonly employed to interpret the model decisions. However, when interpreting misclassified decisions, human intervention may be required. Analyzing the attribu tions across each class within one instance can be particularly labor intensive and influenced by the bias of the human interpreter. In this paper, we present a novel framework to uncover the weakness of the classifier via counterfactual examples. A prober is introduced to learn the correctness of the classifier's decision in terms of binary code-hit or miss. It enables the creation of the counterfactual example concerning the prober's decision. We test the performance of our prober's misclassification detection and verify its effectiveness on the image classification benchmark datasets. Furthermore, by generating counterfactuals that penetrate the prober, we demonstrate that our framework effectively identifies vulnerabilities in the target classifier without relying on label information on the MNIST dataset.

# Probing Latent Subspaces in LLM for AI Security: Identifying and Manipulating Adversarial States 

**Authors**: Xin Wei Chia, Jonathan Pan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09066)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to adversarial manipulations such as jailbreaking via prompt injection attacks. These attacks bypass safety mechanisms to generate restricted or harmful content. In this study, we investigated the underlying latent subspaces of safe and jailbroken states by extracting hidden activations from a LLM. Inspired by attractor dynamics in neuroscience, we hypothesized that LLM activations settle into semi stable states that can be identified and perturbed to induce state transitions. Using dimensionality reduction techniques, we projected activations from safe and jailbroken responses to reveal latent subspaces in lower dimensional spaces. We then derived a perturbation vector that when applied to safe representations, shifted the model towards a jailbreak state. Our results demonstrate that this causal intervention results in statistically significant jailbreak responses in a subset of prompts. Next, we probed how these perturbations propagate through the model's layers, testing whether the induced state change remains localized or cascades throughout the network. Our findings indicate that targeted perturbations induced distinct shifts in activations and model responses. Our approach paves the way for potential proactive defenses, shifting from traditional guardrail based methods to preemptive, model agnostic techniques that neutralize adversarial states at the representation level.

# Implicit Contrastive Representation Learning with Guided Stop-gradient 

**Authors**: Byeongchan Lee, Sehyun Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09058)  

**Abstract**: In self-supervised representation learning, Siamese networks are a natural architecture for learning transformation-invariance by bringing representations of positive pairs closer together. But it is prone to collapse into a degenerate solution. To address the issue, in contrastive learning, a contrastive loss is used to prevent collapse by moving representations of negative pairs away from each other. But it is known that algorithms with negative sampling are not robust to a reduction in the number of negative samples. So, on the other hand, there are algorithms that do not use negative pairs. Many positive-only algorithms adopt asymmetric network architecture consisting of source and target encoders as a key factor in coping with collapse. By exploiting the asymmetric architecture, we introduce a methodology to implicitly incorporate the idea of contrastive learning. As its implementation, we present a novel method guided stop-gradient. We apply our method to benchmark algorithms SimSiam and BYOL and show that our method stabilizes training and boosts performance. We also show that the algorithms with our method work well with small batch sizes and do not collapse even when there is no predictor. The code is available at this https URL.

# TreeX: Generating Global Graphical GNN Explanations via Critical Subtree Extraction 

**Authors**: Shengyao Lu, Jiuding Yang, Baochun Li, Di Niu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09051)  

**Abstract**: The growing demand for transparency and interpretability in critical domains has driven increased interests in comprehending the explainability of Message-Passing (MP) Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Although substantial research efforts have been made to generate explanations for individual graph instances, identifying global explaining concepts for a GNN still poses great challenges, especially when concepts are desired in a graphical form on the dataset level. While most prior works treat GNNs as black boxes, in this paper, we propose to unbox GNNs by analyzing and extracting critical subtrees incurred by the inner workings of message passing, which correspond to critical subgraphs in the datasets. By aggregating subtrees in an embedding space with an efficient algorithm, which does not require complex subgraph matching or search, we can make intuitive graphical explanations for Message-Passing GNNs on local, class and global levels. We empirically show that our proposed approach not only generates clean subgraph concepts on a dataset level in contrast to existing global explaining methods which generate non-graphical rules (e.g., language or embeddings) as explanations, but it is also capable of providing explanations for individual instances with a comparable or even superior performance as compared to leading local-level GNN explainers.

# Discovering Influential Neuron Path in Vision Transformers 

**Authors**: Yifan Wang, Yifei Liu, Yingdong Shi, Changming Li, Anqi Pang, Sibei Yang, Jingyi Yu, Kan Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09046)  

**Abstract**: Vision Transformer models exhibit immense power yet remain opaque to human understanding, posing challenges and risks for practical applications. While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning. The project website including implementation code is available at this https URL.

# ManeuverGPT Agentic Control for Safe Autonomous Stunt Maneuvers 

**Authors**: Shawn Azdam, Pranav Doma, Aliasghar Moj Arab  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09035)  

**Abstract**: The next generation of active safety features in autonomous vehicles should be capable of safely executing evasive hazard-avoidance maneuvers akin to those performed by professional stunt drivers to achieve high-agility motion at the limits of vehicle handling. This paper presents a novel framework, ManeuverGPT, for generating and executing high-dynamic stunt maneuvers in autonomous vehicles using large language model (LLM)-based agents as controllers. We target aggressive maneuvers, such as J-turns, within the CARLA simulation environment and demonstrate an iterative, prompt-based approach to refine vehicle control parameters, starting tabula rasa without retraining model weights. We propose an agentic architecture comprised of three specialized agents (1) a Query Enricher Agent for contextualizing user commands, (2) a Driver Agent for generating maneuver parameters, and (3) a Parameter Validator Agent that enforces physics-based and safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate successful J-turn execution across multiple vehicle models through textual prompts that adapt to differing vehicle dynamics. We evaluate performance via established success criteria and discuss limitations regarding numeric precision and scenario complexity. Our findings underscore the potential of LLM-driven control for flexible, high-dynamic maneuvers, while highlighting the importance of hybrid approaches that combine language-based reasoning with algorithmic validation.

# RFUAV: A Benchmark Dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection and Identification 

**Authors**: Rui Shi, Xiaodong Yu, Shengming Wang, Yijia Zhang, Lu Xu, Peng Pan, Chunlai Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09033)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose RFUAV as a new benchmark dataset for radio-frequency based (RF-based) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) identification and address the following challenges: Firstly, many existing datasets feature a restricted variety of drone types and insufficient volumes of raw data, which fail to meet the demands of practical applications. Secondly, existing datasets often lack raw data covering a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), or do not provide tools for transforming raw data to different SNR levels. This limitation undermines the validity of model training and evaluation. Lastly, many existing datasets do not offer open-access evaluation tools, leading to a lack of unified evaluation standards in current research within this field. RFUAV comprises approximately 1.3 TB of raw frequency data collected from 37 distinct UAVs using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) device in real-world environments. Through in-depth analysis of the RF data in RFUAV, we define a drone feature sequence called RF drone fingerprint, which aids in distinguishing drone signals. In addition to the dataset, RFUAV provides a baseline preprocessing method and model evaluation tools. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that these preprocessing methods achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance using the provided evaluation tools. The RFUAV dataset and baseline implementation are publicly available at this https URL.

# Teaching LLMs How to Learn with Contextual Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Younwoo Choi, Muhammad Adil Asif, Ziwen Han, John Willes, Rahul G. Krishnan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09032)  

**Abstract**: Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, "can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains.

# Enhancing High-Quality Code Generation in Large Language Models with Comparative Prefix-Tuning 

**Authors**: Yuan Jiang, Yujian Zhang, Liang Lu, Christoph Treude, Xiaohong Su, Shan Huang, Tiantian Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09020)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in commercial code completion engines, significantly enhancing coding efficiency and productivity. However, LLMs may generate code with quality issues that violate coding standards and best practices, such as poor code style and maintainability, even when the code is functionally correct. This necessitates additional effort from developers to improve the code, potentially negating the efficiency gains provided by LLMs. To address this problem, we propose a novel comparative prefix-tuning method for controllable high-quality code generation. Our method introduces a single, property-specific prefix that is prepended to the activations of the LLM, serving as a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning. Unlike existing methods that require training multiple prefixes, our approach trains only one prefix and leverages pairs of high-quality and low-quality code samples, introducing a sequence-level ranking loss to guide the model's training. This comparative approach enables the model to better understand the differences between high-quality and low-quality code, focusing on aspects that impact code quality. Additionally, we design a data construction pipeline to collect and annotate pairs of high-quality and low-quality code, facilitating effective training. Extensive experiments on the Code Llama 7B model demonstrate that our method improves code quality by over 100% in certain task categories, while maintaining functional correctness. We also conduct ablation studies and generalization experiments, confirming the effectiveness of our method's components and its strong generalization capability.

# Towards Quantifying Long-Range Interactions in Graph Machine Learning: a Large Graph Dataset and a Measurement 

**Authors**: Huidong Liang, Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde, Baskaran Sripathmanathan, Michael Bronstein, Xiaowen Dong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09008)  

**Abstract**: Long-range dependencies are critical for effective graph representation learning, yet most existing datasets focus on small graphs tailored to inductive tasks, offering limited insight into long-range interactions. Current evaluations primarily compare models employing global attention (e.g., graph transformers) with those using local neighborhood aggregation (e.g., message-passing neural networks) without a direct measurement of long-range dependency. In this work, we introduce City-Networks, a novel large-scale transductive learning dataset derived from real-world city roads. This dataset features graphs with over $10^5$ nodes and significantly larger diameters than those in existing benchmarks, naturally embodying long-range information. We annotate the graphs using an eccentricity-based approach, ensuring that the classification task inherently requires information from distant nodes. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic measurement based on the Jacobians of neighbors from distant hops, offering a principled quantification of long-range dependencies. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications for both our dataset design and the proposed measurement - particularly by focusing on over-smoothing and influence score dilution - which establishes a robust foundation for further exploration of long-range interactions in graph neural networks.

# KNighter: Transforming Static Analysis with LLM-Synthesized Checkers 

**Authors**: Chenyuan Yang, Zijie Zhao, Zichen Xie, Haoyu Li, Lingming Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09002)  

**Abstract**: Static analysis is a powerful technique for bug detection in critical systems like operating system kernels. However, designing and implementing static analyzers is challenging, time-consuming, and typically limited to predefined bug patterns. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for static analysis, directly applying them to scan large codebases remains impractical due to computational constraints and contextual limitations.
We present KNighter, the first approach that unlocks practical LLM-based static analysis by automatically synthesizing static analyzers from historical bug patterns. Rather than using LLMs to directly analyze massive codebases, our key insight is leveraging LLMs to generate specialized static analyzers guided by historical patch knowledge. KNighter implements this vision through a multi-stage synthesis pipeline that validates checker correctness against original patches and employs an automated refinement process to iteratively reduce false positives. Our evaluation on the Linux kernel demonstrates that KNighter generates high-precision checkers capable of detecting diverse bug patterns overlooked by existing human-written analyzers. To date, KNighter-synthesized checkers have discovered 70 new bugs/vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel, with 56 confirmed and 41 already fixed. 11 of these findings have been assigned CVE numbers. This work establishes an entirely new paradigm for scalable, reliable, and traceable LLM-based static analysis for real-world systems via checker synthesis.

# DistJoin: A Decoupled Join Cardinality Estimator based on Adaptive Neural Predicate Modulation 

**Authors**: Kaixin Zhang, Hongzhi Wang, Ziqi Li, Yabin Lu, Yingze Li, Yu Yan, Yiming Guan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08994)  

**Abstract**: Research on learned cardinality estimation has achieved significant progress in recent years. However, existing methods still face distinct challenges that hinder their practical deployment in production environments. We conceptualize these challenges as the "Trilemma of Cardinality Estimation", where learned cardinality estimation methods struggle to balance generality, accuracy, and updatability. To address these challenges, we introduce DistJoin, a join cardinality estimator based on efficient distribution prediction using multi-autoregressive models. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a method for estimating both equi and non-equi join cardinality by leveraging the conditional probability distributions of individual tables in a decoupled manner. (2) To meet the requirements of efficient training and inference for DistJoin, we develop Adaptive Neural Predicate Modulation (ANPM), a high-throughput conditional probability distribution estimation model. (3) We formally analyze the variance of existing similar methods and demonstrate that such approaches suffer from variance accumulation issues. To mitigate this problem, DistJoin employs a selectivity-based approach rather than a count-based approach to infer join cardinality, effectively reducing variance. In summary, DistJoin not only represents the first data-driven method to effectively support both equi and non-equi joins but also demonstrates superior accuracy while enabling fast and flexible updates. We evaluate DistJoin on JOB-light and JOB-light-ranges, extending the evaluation to non-equi join conditions. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves the highest accuracy, robustness to data updates, generality, and comparable update and inference speed relative to existing methods.

# JBFuzz: Jailbreaking LLMs Efficiently and Effectively Using Fuzzing 

**Authors**: Vasudev Gohil  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08990)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great promise as language understanding and decision making tools, and they have permeated various aspects of our everyday life. However, their widespread availability also comes with novel risks, such as generating harmful, unethical, or offensive content, via an attack called jailbreaking. Despite extensive efforts from LLM developers to align LLMs using human feedback, they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To tackle this issue, researchers often employ red-teaming to understand and investigate jailbreak prompts. However, existing red-teaming approaches lack effectiveness, scalability, or both. To address these issues, we propose JBFuzz, a novel effective, automated, and scalable red-teaming technique for jailbreaking LLMs.
JBFuzz is inspired by the success of fuzzing for detecting bugs/vulnerabilities in software. We overcome three challenges related to effectiveness and scalability by devising novel seed prompts, a lightweight mutation engine, and a lightweight and accurate evaluator for guiding the fuzzer. Assimilating all three solutions results in a potent fuzzer that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. We perform extensive experimental evaluation of JBFuzz using nine popular and widely-used LLMs. We find that JBFuzz successfully jailbreaks all LLMs for various harmful/unethical questions, with an average attack success rate of 99%. We also find that JBFuzz is extremely efficient as it jailbreaks a given LLM for a given question in 60 seconds on average. Our work highlights the susceptibility of the state-of-the-art LLMs to jailbreak attacks even after safety alignment, and serves as a valuable red-teaming tool for LLM developers.

# Are ECGs enough? Deep learning classification of cardiac anomalies using only electrocardiograms 

**Authors**: Joao D.S. Marques, Arlindo L. Oliveira  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08960)  

**Abstract**: Electrocardiography (ECG) is an essential tool for diagnosing multiple cardiac anomalies: it provides valuable clinical insights, while being affordable, fast and available in many settings. However, in the current literature, the role of ECG analysis is often unclear: many approaches either rely on additional imaging modalities, such as Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA), which may not always be available, or do not effectively generalize across different classification problems. Furthermore, the availability of public ECG datasets is limited and, in practice, these datasets tend to be small, making it essential to optimize learning strategies. In this study, we investigate the performance of multiple neural network architectures in order to assess the impact of various approaches. Moreover, we check whether these practices enhance model generalization when transfer learning is used to translate information learned in larger ECG datasets, such as PTB-XL and CPSC18, to a smaller, more challenging dataset for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. By leveraging transfer learning, we analyze the extent to which we can improve learning efficiency and predictive performance on limited data. Code available at this https URL .

# FP3: A 3D Foundation Policy for Robotic Manipulation 

**Authors**: Rujia Yang, Geng Chen, Chuan Wen, Yang Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08950)  

**Abstract**: Following its success in natural language processing and computer vision, foundation models that are pre-trained on large-scale multi-task datasets have also shown great potential in robotics. However, most existing robot foundation models rely solely on 2D image observations, ignoring 3D geometric information, which is essential for robots to perceive and reason about the 3D world. In this paper, we introduce FP3, a first large-scale 3D foundation policy model for robotic manipulation. FP3 builds on a scalable diffusion transformer architecture and is pre-trained on 60k trajectories with point cloud observations. With the model design and diverse pre-training data, FP3 can be efficiently fine-tuned for downstream tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that with only 80 demonstrations, FP3 is able to learn a new task with over 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects, significantly surpassing existing robot foundation models.

# KAN-Mixers: a new deep learning architecture for image classification 

**Authors**: Jorge Luiz dos Santos Canuto, Linnyer Beatrys Ruiz Aylon, Rodrigo Clemente Thom de Souza  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08939)  

**Abstract**: Due to their effective performance, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures have become the standard for solving computer vision tasks. Such architectures require large data sets and rely on convolution and self-attention operations. In 2021, MLP-Mixer emerged, an architecture that relies only on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and achieves extremely competitive results when compared to CNNs and ViTs. Despite its good performance in computer vision tasks, the MLP-Mixer architecture may not be suitable for refined feature extraction in images. Recently, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) was proposed as a promising alternative to MLP models. KANs promise to improve accuracy and interpretability when compared to MLPs. Therefore, the present work aims to design a new mixer-based architecture, called KAN-Mixers, using KANs as main layers and evaluate its performance, in terms of several performance metrics, in the image classification task. As main results obtained, the KAN-Mixers model was superior to the MLP, MLP-Mixer and KAN models in the Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with 0.9030 and 0.6980 of average accuracy, respectively.

# Simulator Ensembles for Trustworthy Autonomous Driving Testing 

**Authors**: Lev Sorokin, Matteo Biagiola, Andrea Stocco  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08936)  

**Abstract**: Scenario-based testing with driving simulators is extensively used to identify failing conditions of automated driving assistance systems (ADAS) and reduce the amount of in-field road testing. However, existing studies have shown that repeated test execution in the same as well as in distinct simulators can yield different outcomes, which can be attributed to sources of flakiness or different implementations of the physics, among other factors. In this paper, we present MultiSim, a novel approach to multi-simulation ADAS testing based on a search-based testing approach that leverages an ensemble of simulators to identify failure-inducing, simulator-agnostic test scenarios. During the search, each scenario is evaluated jointly on multiple simulators. Scenarios that produce consistent results across simulators are prioritized for further exploration, while those that fail on only a subset of simulators are given less priority, as they may reflect simulator-specific issues rather than generalizable failures. Our case study, which involves testing a deep neural network-based ADAS on different pairs of three widely used simulators, demonstrates that MultiSim outperforms single-simulator testing by achieving on average a higher rate of simulator-agnostic failures by 51%. Compared to a state-of-the-art multi-simulator approach that combines the outcome of independent test generation campaigns obtained in different simulators, MultiSim identifies 54% more simulator-agnostic failing tests while showing a comparable validity rate. An enhancement of MultiSim that leverages surrogate models to predict simulator disagreements and bypass executions does not only increase the average number of valid failures but also improves efficiency in finding the first valid failure.

# HessianForge: Scalable LiDAR reconstruction with Physics-Informed Neural Representation and Smoothness Energy Constraints 

**Authors**: Hrishikesh Viswanath, Md Ashiqur Rahman, Chi Lin, Damon Conover, Aniket Bera  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08929)  

**Abstract**: Accurate and efficient 3D mapping of large-scale outdoor environments from LiDAR measurements is a fundamental challenge in robotics, particularly towards ensuring smooth and artifact-free surface reconstructions. Although the state-of-the-art methods focus on memory-efficient neural representations for high-fidelity surface generation, they often fail to produce artifact-free manifolds, with artifacts arising due to noisy and sparse inputs. To address this issue, we frame surface mapping as a physics-informed energy optimization problem, enforcing surface smoothness by optimizing an energy functional that penalizes sharp surface ridges. Specifically, we propose a deep learning based approach that learns the signed distance field (SDF) of the surface manifold from raw LiDAR point clouds using a physics-informed loss function that optimizes the $L_2$-Hessian energy of the surface. Our learning framework includes a hierarchical octree based input feature encoding and a multi-scale neural network to iteratively refine the signed distance field at different scales of resolution. Lastly, we introduce a test-time refinement strategy to correct topological inconsistencies and edge distortions that can arise in the generated mesh. We propose a \texttt{CUDA}-accelerated least-squares optimization that locally adjusts vertex positions to enforce feature-preserving smoothing. We evaluate our approach on large-scale outdoor datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of improved accuracy and smoothness.

# Backtracking for Safety 

**Authors**: Bilgehan Sel, Dingcheng Li, Phillip Wallis, Vaishakh Keshava, Ming Jin, Siddhartha Reddy Jonnalagadda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08919)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, but ensuring their safety and alignment with human values remains crucial. Current safety alignment methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning-based approaches, can exhibit vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and often result in shallow safety alignment, primarily focusing on preventing harmful content in the initial tokens of the generated output. While methods like resetting can help recover from unsafe generations by discarding previous tokens and restarting the generation process, they are not well-suited for addressing nuanced safety violations like toxicity that may arise within otherwise benign and lengthy generations. In this paper, we propose a novel backtracking method designed to address these limitations. Our method allows the model to revert to a safer generation state, not necessarily at the beginning, when safety violations occur during generation. This approach enables targeted correction of problematic segments without discarding the entire generated text, thereby preserving efficiency. We demonstrate that our method dramatically reduces toxicity appearing through the generation process with minimal impact to efficiency.

# Robust Unsupervised Fault Diagnosis For High-Dimensional Nonlinear Noisy Data 

**Authors**: Dandan Zhao, Hongpeng Yin, Jintang Bian, Han Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08916)  

**Abstract**: Traditional fault diagnosis methods struggle to handle fault data, with complex data characteristics such as high dimensions and large noise. Deep learning is a promising solution, which typically works well only when labeled fault data are available. To address these problems, a robust unsupervised fault diagnosis using machine learning is proposed in this paper. First, a special dimension reduction method for the high-dimensional fault data is designed. Second, the extracted features are enhanced by incorporating nonlinear information through the learning of a graph structure. Third, to alleviate the problem of reduced fault-diagnosis accuracy attributed to noise and outliers, $l_{2,1}$-norm and typicality-aware constraints are introduced from the perspective of model optimization, respectively. Finally, this paper provides comprehensive theoretical and experimental evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The experiments on both the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process and a real hot-steel milling process show that the proposed method exhibits better robustness compared to other methods, maintaining high diagnostic accuracy even in the presence of outliers or noise.

# Interpreting the Repeated Token Phenomenon in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Itay Yona, Ilia Shumailov, Jamie Hayes, Federico Barbero, Yossi Gandelsman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08908)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their impressive capabilities, often fail to accurately repeat a single word when prompted to, and instead output unrelated text. This unexplained failure mode represents a vulnerability, allowing even end-users to diverge models away from their intended behavior. We aim to explain the causes for this phenomenon and link it to the concept of ``attention sinks'', an emergent LLM behavior crucial for fluency, in which the initial token receives disproportionately high attention scores. Our investigation identifies the neural circuit responsible for attention sinks and shows how long repetitions disrupt this circuit. We extend this finding to other non-repeating sequences that exhibit similar circuit disruptions. To address this, we propose a targeted patch that effectively resolves the issue without negatively impacting the model's overall performance. This study provides a mechanistic explanation for an LLM vulnerability, demonstrating how interpretability can diagnose and address issues, and offering insights that pave the way for more secure and reliable models.

# Prompt-OT: An Optimal Transport Regularization Paradigm for Knowledge Preservation in Vision-Language Model Adaptation 

**Authors**: Xiwen Chen, Wenhui Zhu, Peijie Qiu, Hao Wang, Huayu Li, Haiyu Wu, Aristeidis Sotiras, Yalin Wang, Abolfazl Razi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08906)  

**Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong performance but struggle when adapted to downstream tasks. Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient and effective strategy to adapt VLMs while preserving their pre-trained knowledge. However, existing methods still lead to overfitting and degrade zero-shot generalization. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal transport (OT)-guided prompt learning framework that mitigates forgetting by preserving the structural consistency of feature distributions between pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Unlike conventional point-wise constraints, OT naturally captures cross-instance relationships and expands the feasible parameter space for prompt tuning, allowing a better trade-off between adaptation and generalization. Our approach enforces joint constraints on both vision and text representations, ensuring a holistic feature alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple yet effective method can outperform existing prompt learning strategies in base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset evaluation, and domain generalization without additional augmentation or ensemble techniques.

# LLMs Know What to Drop: Self-Attention Guided KV Cache Eviction for Efficient Long-Context Inference 

**Authors**: Guangtao Wang, Shubhangi Upasani, Chen Wu, Darshan Gandhi, Jonathan Li, Changran Hu, Bo Li, Urmish Thakker  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08879)  

**Abstract**: Efficient long-context inference is critical as large language models (LLMs) adopt context windows of ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. However, the growing key-value (KV) cache and the high computational complexity of attention create significant bottlenecks in memory usage and latency. In this paper, we find that attention in diverse long-context tasks exhibits sparsity, and LLMs implicitly "know" which tokens can be dropped or evicted at the head level after the pre-filling stage. Based on this insight, we propose Self-Attention Guided Eviction~(SAGE-KV), a simple and effective KV eviction cache method for long-context inference. After prefilling, our method performs a one-time top-k selection at both the token and head levels to compress the KV cache, enabling efficient inference with the reduced cache. Evaluations on LongBench and three long-context LLMs (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct-128k, Llama3-8B-Prolong-512k-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-128k) show that SAGE-KV maintains accuracy comparable to full attention while significantly improving efficiency. Specifically, SAGE-KV achieves 4x higher memory efficiency with improved accuracy over the static KV cache selection method StreamLLM, and 2x higher memory efficiency with better accuracy than the dynamic KV cache selection method Quest.

**Authors**: Cameron Redovian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08872)  

**Abstract**: We integrate a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm with the DreamerV3 architecture to improve load balancing in operating systems. This approach enables rapid adaptation to dynamic workloads with minimal retraining, outperforming the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm in standard and adaptive trials. It demonstrates robust resilience to catastrophic forgetting, maintaining high performance under varying workload distributions and sizes. These findings have important implications for optimizing resource management and performance in modern operating systems. By addressing the challenges posed by dynamic and heterogeneous workloads, our approach advances the adaptability and efficiency of reinforcement learning in real-world system management tasks.

# Zero-Shot Action Generalization with Limited Observations 

**Authors**: Abdullah Alchihabi, Hanping Zhang, Yuhong Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08867)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable success in solving sequential decision-making problems. However, in real-world scenarios, RL agents often struggle to generalize when faced with unseen actions that were not encountered during training. Some previous works on zero-shot action generalization rely on large datasets of action observations to capture the behaviors of new actions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel zero-shot framework, Action Generalization from Limited Observations (AGLO). Our framework has two main components: an action representation learning module and a policy learning module. The action representation learning module extracts discriminative embeddings of actions from limited observations, while the policy learning module leverages the learned action representations, along with augmented synthetic action representations, to learn a policy capable of handling tasks with unseen actions. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for zero-shot action generalization across multiple benchmark tasks, showcasing its effectiveness in generalizing to new actions with minimal action observations.

# ResBench: Benchmarking LLM-Generated FPGA Designs with Resource Awareness 

**Authors**: Ce Guo, Tong Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08823)  

**Abstract**: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in modern hardware design, yet writing Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for FPGA implementation remains labor-intensive and complex. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for automating HDL generation, but existing benchmarks for LLM HDL code generation primarily evaluate functional correctness while overlooking the critical aspect of hardware resource efficiency. Moreover, current benchmarks lack diversity, failing to capture the broad range of real-world FPGA applications. To address these gaps, we introduce ResBench, the first resource-oriented benchmark explicitly designed to differentiate between resource-optimized and inefficient LLM-generated HDL. ResBench consists of 56 problems across 12 categories, covering applications from finite state machines to financial computing. Our evaluation framework systematically integrates FPGA resource constraints, with a primary focus on Lookup Table (LUT) usage, enabling a realistic assessment of hardware efficiency. Experimental results reveal substantial differences in resource utilization across LLMs, demonstrating ResBench's effectiveness in distinguishing models based on their ability to generate resource-optimized FPGA designs.

# Cross-Examiner: Evaluating Consistency of Large Language Model-Generated Explanations 

**Authors**: Danielle Villa, Maria Chang, Keerthiram Murugesan, Rosario Uceda-Sosa, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08815)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to explain their outputs to enhance accuracy and transparency. However, evidence suggests that these explanations can misrepresent the models' true reasoning processes. One effective way to identify inaccuracies or omissions in these explanations is through consistency checking, which typically involves asking follow-up questions. This paper introduces, cross-examiner, a new method for generating follow-up questions based on a model's explanation of an initial question. Our method combines symbolic information extraction with language model-driven question generation, resulting in better follow-up questions than those produced by LLMs alone. Additionally, this approach is more flexible than other methods and can generate a wider variety of follow-up questions.

# Robust Multi-Objective Controlled Decoding of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Seongho Son, William Bankes, Sangwoong Yoon, Shyam Sundhar Ramesh, Xiaohang Tang, Ilija Bogunovic  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08796)  

**Abstract**: Test-time alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences offers a flexible way to generate responses aligned to diverse objectives without extensive retraining of LLMs. Existing methods achieve alignment to multiple objectives simultaneously (e.g., instruction-following, helpfulness, conciseness) by optimizing their corresponding reward functions. However, they often rely on predefined weights or optimize for averages, sacrificing one objective for another and leading to unbalanced outcomes. To address this, we introduce Robust Multi-Objective Decoding (RMOD), a novel inference-time algorithm that optimizes for improving worst-case rewards. RMOD formalizes the robust decoding problem as a maximin two-player game between reward weights and the sampling policy, solving for the Nash equilibrium. We show that the game reduces to a convex optimization problem to find the worst-case weights, while the best response policy can be computed analytically. We also introduce a practical RMOD variant designed for efficient decoding with contemporary LLMs, incurring minimal computational overhead compared to non-robust Multi-Objective Decoding (MOD) methods. Our experimental results showcase the effectiveness of RMOD in generating responses equitably aligned with diverse objectives, outperforming baselines up to 20%.

# Towards Interpretable Protein Structure Prediction with Sparse Autoencoders 

**Authors**: Nithin Parsan, David J. Yang, John J. Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08764)  

**Abstract**: Protein language models have revolutionized structure prediction, but their nonlinear nature obscures how sequence representations inform structure prediction. While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) offer a path to interpretability here by learning linear representations in high-dimensional space, their application has been limited to smaller protein language models unable to perform structure prediction. In this work, we make two key advances: (1) we scale SAEs to ESM2-3B, the base model for ESMFold, enabling mechanistic interpretability of protein structure prediction for the first time, and (2) we adapt Matryoshka SAEs for protein language models, which learn hierarchically organized features by forcing nested groups of latents to reconstruct inputs independently. We demonstrate that our Matryoshka SAEs achieve comparable or better performance than standard architectures. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that SAEs trained on ESM2-3B significantly outperform those trained on smaller models for both biological concept discovery and contact map prediction. Finally, we present an initial case study demonstrating how our approach enables targeted steering of ESMFold predictions, increasing structure solvent accessibility while fixing the input sequence. To facilitate further investigation by the broader community, we open-source our code, dataset, pretrained models this https URL , and visualizer this https URL .

# Heterogeneous Graph Structure Learning through the Lens of Data-generating Processes 

**Authors**: Keyue Jiang, Bohan Tang, Xiaowen Dong, Laura Toni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08760)  

**Abstract**: Inferring the graph structure from observed data is a key task in graph machine learning to capture the intrinsic relationship between data entities. While significant advancements have been made in learning the structure of homogeneous graphs, many real-world graphs exhibit heterogeneous patterns where nodes and edges have multiple types. This paper fills this gap by introducing the first approach for heterogeneous graph structure learning (HGSL). To this end, we first propose a novel statistical model for the data-generating process (DGP) of heterogeneous graph data, namely hidden Markov networks for heterogeneous graphs (H2MN). Then we formalize HGSL as a maximum a-posterior estimation problem parameterized by such DGP and derive an alternating optimization method to obtain a solution together with a theoretical justification of the optimization conditions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that our proposed method excels in learning structure on heterogeneous graphs in terms of edge type identification and edge weight recovery.

# Exposing Product Bias in LLM Investment Recommendation 

**Authors**: Yuhan Zhi, Xiaoyu Zhang, Longtian Wang, Shumin Jiang, Shiqing Ma, Xiaohong Guan, Chao Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08750)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs), as a new generation of recommendation engines, possess powerful summarization and data analysis capabilities, surpassing traditional recommendation systems in both scope and performance. One promising application is investment recommendation. In this paper, we reveal a novel product bias in LLM investment recommendation, where LLMs exhibit systematic preferences for specific products. Such preferences can subtly influence user investment decisions, potentially leading to inflated valuations of products and financial bubbles, posing risks to both individual investors and market stability. To comprehensively study the product bias, we develop an automated pipeline to create a dataset of 567,000 samples across five asset classes (stocks, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, savings, and portfolios). With this dataset, we present the bf first study on product bias in LLM investment recommendations. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit clear product preferences, such as certain stocks (e.g., `AAPL' from Apple and `MSFT' from Microsoft). Notably, this bias persists even after applying debiasing techniques. We urge AI researchers to take heed of the product bias in LLM investment recommendations and its implications, ensuring fairness and security in the digital space and market.

# Source-free domain adaptation based on label reliability for cross-domain bearing fault diagnosis 

**Authors**: Wenyi Wu, Hao Zhang, Zhisen Wei, Xiao-Yuan Jing, Qinghua Zhang, Songsong Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08749)  

**Abstract**: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has been exploited for cross-domain bearing fault diagnosis without access to source data. Current methods select partial target samples with reliable pseudo-labels for model adaptation, which is sub-optimal due to the ignored target samples. We argue that every target sample can contribute to model adaptation, and accordingly propose in this paper a novel SFDA-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis that exploits both reliable and unreliable pseudo-labels. We develop a data-augmentation-based label voting strategy to divide the target samples into reliable and unreliable ones. We propose to explore the underlying relation between feature space and label space by using the reliable pseudo-labels as ground-truth labels, meanwhile, alleviating negative transfer by maximizing the entropy of the unreliable pseudo-labels. The proposed method achieves well-balance between discriminability and diversity by taking advantage of reliable and unreliable pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments are conducted on two bearing fault benchmarks, demonstrating that our approach achieves significant performance improvements against existing SFDA-based bearing fault diagnosis methods. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Mirror Descent and Novel Exponentiated Gradient Algorithms Using Trace-Form Entropies and Deformed Logarithms 

**Authors**: Andrzej Cichocki, Toshihisa Tanaka, Sergio Cruces  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08748)  

**Abstract**: In this paper we propose and investigate a wide class of Mirror Descent updates (MD) and associated novel Generalized Exponentiated Gradient (GEG) algorithms by exploiting various trace-form entropies and associated deformed logarithms and their inverses - deformed (generalized) exponential functions. The proposed algorithms can be considered as extension of entropic MD and generalization of multiplicative updates. In the literature, there exist nowadays over fifty mathematically well defined generalized entropies, so impossible to exploit all of them in one research paper. So we focus on a few selected most popular entropies and associated logarithms like the Tsallis, Kaniadakis and Sharma-Taneja-Mittal and some of their extension like Tempesta or Kaniadakis-Scarfone entropies. The shape and properties of the deformed logarithms and their inverses are tuned by one or more hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution of training data, which can be designed to the specific geometry of the optimization problem, leading to potentially faster convergence and better performance. The using generalized entropies and associated deformed logarithms in the Bregman divergence, used as a regularization term, provides some new insight into exponentiated gradient descent updates.

# Neural Network for Blind Unmixing: a novel MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) Approach 

**Authors**: Chao Zhou, Wei Pu, Miguel Rodrigues  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08745)  

**Abstract**: Hyperspectral image (HSI) unmixing is a challenging research problem that tries to identify the constituent components, known as endmembers, and their corresponding proportions, known as abundances, in the scene by analysing images captured by hyperspectral cameras. Recently, many deep learning based unmixing approaches have been proposed with the surge of machine learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, these methods face two notable challenges: 1. They frequently yield results lacking physical significance, such as signatures corresponding to unknown or non-existent materials. 2. CNNs, as general-purpose network structures, are not explicitly tailored for unmixing tasks. In response to these concerns, our work draws inspiration from double deep image prior (DIP) techniques and algorithm unrolling, presenting a novel network structure that effectively addresses both issues. Specifically, we first propose a MatrixConv Unmixing (MCU) approach for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively, which can be solved via certain iterative solvers. We then unroll these solvers to build two sub-networks, endmember estimation DIP (UEDIP) and abundance estimation DIP (UADIP), to generate the estimation of endmember and abundance, respectively. The overall network is constructed by assembling these two sub-networks. In order to generate meaningful unmixing results, we also propose a composite loss function. To further improve the unmixing quality, we also add explicitly a regularizer for endmember and abundance estimation, respectively. The proposed methods are tested for effectiveness on both synthetic and real datasets.

# Oasis: One Image is All You Need for Multimodal Instruction Data Synthesis 

**Authors**: Letian Zhang, Quan Cui, Bingchen Zhao, Cheng Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08741)  

**Abstract**: The success of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has been largely attributed to the large-scale training data. However, the training data of many MLLMs is unavailable due to privacy concerns. The expensive and labor-intensive process of collecting multi-modal data further exacerbates the problem. Is it possible to synthesize multi-modal training data automatically without compromising diversity and quality? In this paper, we propose a new method, Oasis, to synthesize high-quality multi-modal data with only images. Oasis breaks through traditional methods by prompting only images to the MLLMs, thus extending the data diversity by a large margin. Our method features a delicate quality control method which ensures the data quality. We collected over 500k data and conducted incremental experiments on LLaVA-NeXT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of MLLMs. The image-based synthesis also allows us to focus on the specific-domain ability of MLLMs. Code and data will be publicly available.

# HeGMN: Heterogeneous Graph Matching Network for Learning Graph Similarity 

**Authors**: Shilong Sang, Ke-Jia Chen, Zheng liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08739)  

**Abstract**: Graph similarity learning (GSL), also referred to as graph matching in many scenarios, is a fundamental problem in computer vision, pattern recognition, and graph learning. However, previous GSL methods assume that graphs are homogeneous and struggle to maintain their performance on heterogeneous graphs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a Heterogeneous Graph Matching Network (HeGMN), which is an end-to-end graph similarity learning framework composed of a two-tier matching mechanism. Firstly, a heterogeneous graph isomorphism network is proposed as the encoder, which reinvents graph isomorphism network for heterogeneous graphs by perceiving different semantic relationships during aggregation. Secondly, a graph-level and node-level matching modules are designed, both employing type-aligned matching principles. The former conducts graph-level matching by node type alignment, and the latter computes the interactions between the cross-graph nodes with the same type thus reducing noise interference and computational overhead. Finally, the graph-level and node-level matching features are combined and fed into fully connected layers for predicting graph similarity scores. In experiments, we propose a heterogeneous graph resampling method to construct heterogeneous graph pairs and define the corresponding heterogeneous graph edit distance, filling the gap in missing datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HeGMN consistently achieves advanced performance on graph similarity prediction across all datasets.

# Representing 3D Shapes With 64 Latent Vectors for 3D Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: In Cho, Youngbeom Yoo, Subin Jeon, Seon Joo Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08737)  

**Abstract**: Constructing a compressed latent space through a variational autoencoder (VAE) is the key for efficient 3D diffusion models. This paper introduces COD-VAE, a VAE that encodes 3D shapes into a COmpact set of 1D latent vectors without sacrificing quality. COD-VAE introduces a two-stage autoencoder scheme to improve compression and decoding efficiency. First, our encoder block progressively compresses point clouds into compact latent vectors via intermediate point patches. Second, our triplane-based decoder reconstructs dense triplanes from latent vectors instead of directly decoding neural fields, significantly reducing computational overhead of neural fields decoding. Finally, we propose uncertainty-guided token pruning, which allocates resources adaptively by skipping computations in simpler regions and improves the decoder efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that COD-VAE achieves 16x compression compared to the baseline while maintaining quality. This enables 20.8x speedup in generation, highlighting that a large number of latent vectors is not a prerequisite for high-quality reconstruction and generation.

**Authors**: Aniket Vaidya, Anurag Awasthi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08734)  

**Abstract**: In today's increasingly digital interactions, robust Identity Verification (IDV) is crucial for security and trust. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming IDV, enhancing accuracy and fraud detection. This paper introduces ``Zero to One,'' a holistic conceptual framework for developing AI-powered IDV products. This paper outlines the foundational problem and research objectives that necessitate a new framework for IDV in the age of AI. It details the evolution of identity verification and the current regulatory landscape to contextualize the need for a robust conceptual model. The core of the paper is the presentation of the ``Zero to One'' framework itself, dissecting its four essential components: Document Verification, Biometric Verification, Risk Assessment, and Orchestration. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this conceptual model and suggesting future research directions focused on the framework's further development and application. The framework addresses security, privacy, UX, and regulatory compliance, offering a structured approach to building effective IDV solutions. Successful IDV platforms require a balanced conceptual understanding of verification methods, risk management, and operational scalability, with AI as a key enabler. This paper presents the ``Zero to One'' framework as a refined conceptual model, detailing verification layers, and AI's transformative role in shaping next-generation IDV products.

# Quantifying Circadian Desynchrony in ICU Patients and Its Association with Delirium 

**Authors**: Yuanfang Ren, Andrea E. Davidson, Jiaqing Zhang, Miguel Contreras, Ayush K. Patel, Michelle Gumz, Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Parisa Rashidi, Azra Bihorac  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08732)  

**Abstract**: Background: Circadian desynchrony characterized by the misalignment between an individual's internal biological rhythms and external environmental cues, significantly affects various physiological processes and health outcomes. Quantifying circadian desynchrony often requires prolonged and frequent monitoring, and currently, an easy tool for this purpose is missing. Additionally, its association with the incidence of delirium has not been clearly explored. Methods: A prospective observational study was carried out in intensive care units (ICU) of a tertiary hospital. Circadian transcriptomics of blood monocytes from 86 individuals were collected on two consecutive days, although a second sample could not be obtained from all participants. Using two public datasets comprised of healthy volunteers, we replicated a model for determining internal circadian time. We developed an approach to quantify circadian desynchrony by comparing internal circadian time and external blood collection time. We applied the model and quantified circadian desynchrony index among ICU patients, and investigated its association with the incidence of delirium. Results: The replicated model for determining internal circadian time achieved comparable high accuracy. The quantified circadian desynchrony index was significantly higher among critically ill ICU patients compared to healthy subjects, with values of 10.03 hours vs 2.50-2.95 hours (p < 0.001). Most ICU patients had a circadian desynchrony index greater than 9 hours. Additionally, the index was lower in patients whose blood samples were drawn after 3pm, with values of 5.00 hours compared to 10.01-10.90 hours in other groups (p < 0.001)...

# Preserving Product Fidelity in Large Scale Image Recontextualization with Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Ishaan Malhi, Praneet Dutta, Ellie Talius, Sally Ma, Brendan Driscoll, Krista Holden, Garima Pruthi, Arunachalam Narayanaswamy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08729)  

**Abstract**: We present a framework for high-fidelity product image recontextualization using text-to-image diffusion models and a novel data augmentation pipeline. This pipeline leverages image-to-video diffusion, in/outpainting & negatives to create synthetic training data, addressing limitations of real-world data collection for this task. Our method improves the quality and diversity of generated images by disentangling product representations and enhancing the model's understanding of product characteristics. Evaluation on the ABO dataset and a private product dataset, using automated metrics and human assessment, demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in generating realistic and compelling product visualizations, with implications for applications such as e-commerce and virtual product showcasing.

# Enhancing Traffic Signal Control through Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Policy Reuse 

**Authors**: Yihong Li, Chengwei Zhang, Furui Zhan, Wanting Liu, Kailing Zhou, Longji Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08728)  

**Abstract**: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown significant potential in traffic signal control (TSC). However, current MARL-based methods often suffer from insufficient generalization due to the fixed traffic patterns and road network conditions used during training. This limitation results in poor adaptability to new traffic scenarios, leading to high retraining costs and complex deployment. To address this challenge, we propose two algorithms: PLight and PRLight. PLight employs a model-based reinforcement learning approach, pretraining control policies and environment models using predefined source-domain traffic scenarios. The environment model predicts the state transitions, which facilitates the comparison of environmental features. PRLight further enhances adaptability by adaptively selecting pre-trained PLight agents based on the similarity between the source and target domains to accelerate the learning process in the target domain. We evaluated the algorithms through two transfer settings: (1) adaptability to different traffic scenarios within the same road network, and (2) generalization across different road networks. The results show that PRLight significantly reduces the adaptation time compared to learning from scratch in new TSC scenarios, achieving optimal performance using similarities between available and target scenarios.

# Training Plug-n-Play Knowledge Modules with Deep Context Distillation 

**Authors**: Lucas Caccia, Alan Ansell, Edoardo Ponti, Ivan Vulić, Alessandro Sordoni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08727)  

**Abstract**: Dynamically integrating new or rapidly evolving information after (Large) Language Model pre-training remains challenging, particularly in low-data scenarios or when dealing with private and specialized documents. In-context learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) face limitations, including their high inference costs and their inability to capture global document information. In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context. Our method outperforms standard next-token prediction and pre-instruction training techniques, across two datasets. Finally, we highlight synergies between KMs and retrieval-augmented generation.

# SIMAC: A Semantic-Driven Integrated Multimodal Sensing And Communication Framework 

**Authors**: Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Feibo Jiang, Kezhi Wang, Dapeng Oliver Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08726)  

**Abstract**: Traditional single-modality sensing faces limitations in accuracy and capability, and its decoupled implementation with communication systems increases latency in bandwidth-constrained environments. Additionally, single-task-oriented sensing systems fail to address users' diverse demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose a semantic-driven integrated multimodal sensing and communication (SIMAC) framework. This framework leverages a joint source-channel coding architecture to achieve simultaneous sensing decoding and transmission of sensing results. Specifically, SIMAC first introduces a multimodal semantic fusion (MSF) network, which employs two extractors to extract semantic information from radar signals and images, respectively. MSF then applies cross-attention mechanisms to fuse these unimodal features and generate multimodal semantic representations. Secondly, we present a large language model (LLM)-based semantic encoder (LSE), where relevant communication parameters and multimodal semantics are mapped into a unified latent space and input to the LLM, enabling channel-adaptive semantic encoding. Thirdly, a task-oriented sensing semantic decoder (SSD) is proposed, in which different decoded heads are designed according to the specific needs of tasks. Simultaneously, a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to train the SIMAC framework, achieving diverse sensing services. Finally, experimental simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves diverse sensing services and higher accuracy.

# The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government 

**Authors**: Zeynep Engin, Jon Crowcroft, David Hand, Philip Treleaven  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08725)  

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.

# A Recipe for Improving Remote Sensing VLM Zero Shot Generalization 

**Authors**: Aviad Barzilai, Yotam Gigi, Vered Silverman, Yehonathan Refael, Bolous Jaber, Amr Helmy, Tomer Shekel, George Leifman, Genady Beryozkin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08722)  

**Abstract**: Foundation models have had a significant impact across various AI applications, enabling use cases that were previously impossible. Contrastive Visual Language Models (VLMs), in particular, have outperformed other techniques in many tasks. However, their prevalence in remote sensing (RS) is still limited, due to the scarcity of diverse remote-sensing visual-language datasets. In this work we introduce two novel image-caption datasets for training of remote sensing foundation models. The first dataset pairs aerial and satellite imagery with captions generated by Gemini using landmarks extracted from Google Maps. The second dataset utilizes public web images and their corresponding alt-text, filtered for the remote sensing domain, resulting in a diverse dataset with greater breadth in image styles and subject matter. These datasets are used to pre-train the MaMMUT~\citep{kuo2023mammutsimplearchitecturejoint} VLM architecture, resulting in state-of-the-art generalization performance in zero-shot cross-modal retrieval on well-known public benchmarks. Finally, we present our ongoing research to distill image-level knowledge gained in the VLM contrastive training procedure to enhance the model's localization ability. Specifically, we iteratively generate pseudo-labels for image regions based on the model's attention maps and use these labels for further training. To mitigate noisy attention maps and create robust segmentation masks, we introduce a novel attention-pooling mechanism called the Smooth-Attention-Operation.

# AI for Just Work: Constructing Diverse Imaginations of AI beyond "Replacing Humans" 

**Authors**: Weina Jin, Nicholas Vincent, Ghassan Hamarneh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08720)  

**Abstract**: The AI community usually focuses on "how" to develop AI techniques, but lacks thorough open discussions on "why" we develop AI. Lacking critical reflections on the general visions and purposes of AI may make the community vulnerable to manipulation. In this position paper, we explore the "why" question of AI. We denote answers to the "why" question the imaginations of AI, which depict our general visions, frames, and mindsets for the prospects of AI. We identify that the prevailing vision in the AI community is largely a monoculture that emphasizes objectives such as replacing humans and improving productivity. Our critical examination of this mainstream imagination highlights its underpinning and potentially unjust assumptions. We then call to diversify our collective imaginations of AI, embedding ethical assumptions from the outset in the imaginations of AI. To facilitate the community's pursuit of diverse imaginations, we demonstrate one process for constructing a new imagination of "AI for just work," and showcase its application in the medical image synthesis task to make it more ethical. We hope this work will help the AI community to open dialogues with civil society on the visions and purposes of AI, and inspire more technical works and advocacy in pursuit of diverse and ethical imaginations to restore the value of AI for the public good.

# A Semantic Link Network Model for Supporting Traceability of Logistics on Blockchain 

**Authors**: Xiaoping Sun, Sirui Zhuge, Hai Zhuge  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08717)  

**Abstract**: The ability of tracing states of logistic transportations requires an efficient storage and retrieval of the state of logistic transportations and locations of logistic objects. However, the restriction of sharing states and locations of logistic objects across organizations from different countries makes it hard to deploy a centralized database for implementing the traceability in a cross-border logistic system. This paper proposes a semantic data model on Blockchain to represent a logistic process based on the Semantic Link Network model where each semantic link represents a logistic transportation of a logistic object between two parties. A state representation model is designed to represent the states of a logistic transportation with semantic links. It enables the locations of logistic objects to be derived from the link states. A mapping from the semantic links to the blockchain transactions is designed to enable schema of semantic links and states of semantic links to be published in blockchain transactions. To improve the efficiency of tracing a path of semantic links on blockchain platform, an algorithm is designed to build shortcuts along the path of semantic links to enable a query on the path of a logistic object to reach the target in logarithmic steps on the blockchain platform. A reward-penalty policy is designed to allow participants to confirm the state of links on blockchain. Analysis and simulation demonstrate the flexibility, effectiveness and the efficiency of Semantic Link Network on immutable blockchain for implementing logistic traceability.

# AuthorMist: Evading AI Text Detectors with Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Isaac David, Arthur Gervais  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08716)  

**Abstract**: In the age of powerful AI-generated text, automatic detectors have emerged to identify machine-written content. This poses a threat to author privacy and freedom, as text authored with AI assistance may be unfairly flagged. We propose AuthorMist, a novel reinforcement learning-based system to transform AI-generated text into human-like writing. AuthorMist leverages a 3-billion-parameter language model as a backbone, fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GPRO) to paraphrase text in a way that evades AI detectors.
Our framework establishes a generic approach where external detector APIs (GPTZero, WinstonAI, this http URL, etc.) serve as reward functions within the reinforcement learning loop, enabling the model to systematically learn outputs that these detectors are less likely to classify as AI-generated. This API-as-reward methodology can be applied broadly to optimize text against any detector with an accessible interface. Experiments on multiple datasets and detectors demonstrate that AuthorMist effectively reduces the detectability of AI-generated text while preserving the original meaning. Our evaluation shows attack success rates ranging from 78.6% to 96.2% against individual detectors, significantly outperforming baseline paraphrasing methods. AuthorMist maintains high semantic similarity (above 0.94) with the original text while successfully evading detection. These results highlight limitations in current AI text detection technologies and raise questions about the sustainability of the detection-evasion arms race.

# Versatile Multimodal Controls for Whole-Body Talking Human Animation 

**Authors**: Zheng Qin, Ruobing Zheng, Yabing Wang, Tianqi Li, Zixin Zhu, Minghui Yang, Ming Yang, Le Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08714)  

**Abstract**: Human animation from a single reference image shall be flexible to synthesize whole-body motion for either a headshot or whole-body portrait, where the motions are readily controlled by audio signal and text prompts. This is hard for most existing methods as they only support producing pre-specified head or half-body motion aligned with audio inputs. In this paper, we propose a versatile human animation method, i.e., VersaAnimator, which generates whole-body talking human from arbitrary portrait images, not only driven by audio signal but also flexibly controlled by text prompts. Specifically, we design a text-controlled, audio-driven motion generator that produces whole-body motion representations in 3D synchronized with audio inputs while following textual motion descriptions. To promote natural smooth motion, we propose a code-pose translation module to link VAE codebooks with 2D DWposes extracted from template videos. Moreover, we introduce a multi-modal video diffusion that generates photorealistic human animation from a reference image according to both audio inputs and whole-body motion representations. Extensive experiments show that VersaAnimator outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.

# TH-Bench: Evaluating Evading Attacks via Humanizing AI Text on Machine-Generated Text Detectors 

**Authors**: Jingyi Zheng, Junfeng Wang, Zhen Sun, Wenhan Dong, Yule Liu, Xinlei He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08708)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, Machine-Generated Texts (MGTs) have become increasingly fluent, high-quality, and informative. Existing wide-range MGT detectors are designed to identify MGTs to prevent the spread of plagiarism and misinformation. However, adversaries attempt to humanize MGTs to evade detection (named evading attacks), which requires only minor modifications to bypass MGT detectors. Unfortunately, existing attacks generally lack a unified and comprehensive evaluation framework, as they are assessed using different experimental settings, model architectures, and datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce the Text-Humanization Benchmark (TH-Bench), the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate evading attacks against MGT detectors. TH-Bench evaluates attacks across three key dimensions: evading effectiveness, text quality, and computational overhead. Our extensive experiments evaluate 6 state-of-the-art attacks against 13 MGT detectors across 6 datasets, spanning 19 domains and generated by 11 widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that no single evading attack excels across all three dimensions. Through in-depth analysis, we highlight the strengths and limitations of different attacks. More importantly, we identify a trade-off among three dimensions and propose two optimization insights. Through preliminary experiments, we validate their correctness and effectiveness, offering potential directions for future research.

# Life-Cycle Routing Vulnerabilities of LLM Router 

**Authors**: Qiqi Lin, Xiaoyang Ji, Shengfang Zhai, Qingni Shen, Zhi Zhang, Yuejian Fang, Yansong Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08704)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, yet their performance and computational costs vary significantly. LLM routers play a crucial role in dynamically balancing these trade-offs. While previous studies have primarily focused on routing efficiency, security vulnerabilities throughout the entire LLM router life cycle, from training to inference, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into the life-cycle routing vulnerabilities of LLM routers. We evaluate both white-box and black-box adversarial robustness, as well as backdoor robustness, across several representative routing models under extensive experimental settings. Our experiments uncover several key findings: 1) Mainstream DNN-based routers tend to exhibit the weakest adversarial and backdoor robustness, largely due to their strong feature extraction capabilities that amplify vulnerabilities during both training and inference; 2) Training-free routers demonstrate the strongest robustness across different attack types, benefiting from the absence of learnable parameters that can be manipulated. These findings highlight critical security risks spanning the entire life cycle of LLM routers and provide insights for developing more robust models.

**Authors**: Julien Posso, Hugo Kieffer, Nicolas Menga, Omar Hlimi, Sébastien Tarris, Hubert Guerard, Guy Bois, Matthieu Couderc, Eric Jenn  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08700)  

**Abstract**: This study introduces a lightweight U-Net model optimized for real-time semantic segmentation of aerial images, targeting the efficient utilization of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded computing platforms. We maintain the accuracy of the U-Net on a real-world dataset while significantly reducing the model's parameters and Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations by a factor of 16. Our comprehensive analysis covers three hardware platforms (CPU, GPU, and FPGA) and five different toolchains (TVM, FINN, Vitis AI, TensorFlow GPU, and cuDNN), assessing each on metrics such as latency, power consumption, memory footprint, energy efficiency, and FPGA resource usage. The results highlight the trade-offs between these platforms and toolchains, with a particular focus on the practical deployment challenges in real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate that while the FPGA with Vitis AI emerges as the superior choice due to its performance, energy efficiency, and maturity, it requires specialized hardware knowledge, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach in selecting embedded computing solutions for semantic segmentation tasks

# Blockchain As a Platform For Artificial Intelligence (AI) Transparency 

**Authors**: Afroja Akther, Ayesha Arobee, Abdullah Al Adnan, Omum Auyon, ASM Johirul Islam, Farhad Akter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08699)  

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly complex and autonomous, concerns over transparency and accountability have intensified. The "black box" problem in AI decision-making limits stakeholders' ability to understand, trust, and verify outcomes, particularly in high-stakes sectors such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized, immutable, and transparent characteristics, presents a potential solution to enhance AI transparency and auditability. This paper explores the integration of blockchain with AI to improve decision traceability, data provenance, and model accountability. By leveraging blockchain as an immutable record-keeping system, AI decision-making can become more interpretable, fostering trust among users and regulatory compliance. However, challenges such as scalability, integration complexity, and computational overhead must be addressed to fully realize this synergy. This study discusses existing research, proposes a framework for blockchain-enhanced AI transparency, and highlights practical applications, benefits, and limitations. The findings suggest that blockchain could be a foundational technology for ensuring AI systems remain accountable, ethical, and aligned with regulatory standards.

# ProReflow: Progressive Reflow with Decomposed Velocity 

**Authors**: Lei Ke, Haohang Xu, Xuefei Ning, Yu Li, Jiajun Li, Haoling Li, Yuxuan Lin, Dongsheng Jiang, Yujiu Yang, Linfeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04824)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in both image and video generation while still suffering from huge computation costs. As an effective solution, flow matching aims to reflow the diffusion process of diffusion models into a straight line for a few-step and even one-step generation. However, in this paper, we suggest that the original training pipeline of flow matching is not optimal and introduce two techniques to improve it. Firstly, we introduce progressive reflow, which progressively reflows the diffusion models in local timesteps until the whole diffusion progresses, reducing the difficulty of flow matching. Second, we introduce aligned v-prediction, which highlights the importance of direction matching in flow matching over magnitude matching. Experimental results on SDv1.5 and SDXL demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, for example, conducting on SDv1.5 achieves an FID of 10.70 on MSCOCO2014 validation set with only 4 sampling steps, close to our teacher model (32 DDIM steps, FID = 10.05).

**Authors**: Josue N. Rivera, Dengfeng Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01297)  

**Abstract**: This paper formalizes Hamiltonian-Informed Optimal Neural (Hion) controllers, a novel class of neural network-based controllers for dynamical systems and explicit non-linear model predictive control. Hion controllers estimate future states and compute optimal control inputs using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The proposed framework allows for customization of transient behavior, addressing limitations of existing methods. The Taylored Multi-Faceted Approach for Neural ODE and Optimal Control (T-mano) architecture facilitates training and ensures accurate state estimation. Optimal control strategies are demonstrated for both linear and non-linear dynamical systems.
