However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \\textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \\textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25.

However, existing open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses (those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning, thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.'}

Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven baselines."}

Moving beyond just preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository, we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe deployment in diverse global contexts."}

Despite recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present \\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \\emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and \\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider, Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\\% higher than SOTA, and the CoT pipeline is 1.4\\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data. Overall, \\emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic industrial constraints. The code is available at this https URL.'}

This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.'}

We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use. RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world scenarios. Code: this https URL.'}
