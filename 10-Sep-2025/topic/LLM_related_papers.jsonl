However, activating such capabilities through training remains challenging, as existing methods predominantly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) over synthetic data, which encourages teacher-forced imitation rather than exploration and generalization. Different from them, we propose \\textbf{Parallel-R1}, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables parallel thinking behaviors for complex real-world reasoning tasks. Our framework employs a progressive curriculum that explicitly addresses the cold-start problem in training parallel thinking with RL. We first use SFT on prompt-generated trajectories from easier tasks to instill the parallel thinking ability, then transition to RL to explore and generalize this skill on harder problems. Experiments on various math benchmarks, including MATH, AMC23, and AIME, show that Parallel-R1 successfully instills parallel thinking, leading to 8.4% accuracy improvements over the sequential thinking model trained directly on challenging tasks with RL. Further analysis reveals a clear shift in the model's thinking behavior: at an early stage, it uses parallel thinking as an exploration strategy, while in a later stage, it uses the same capability for multi-perspective verification. Most significantly, we validate parallel thinking as a \\textbf{mid-training exploration scaffold}, where this temporary exploratory phase unlocks a higher performance ceiling after RL, yielding a 42.9% improvement over the baseline on AIME25.

Retraining LLMs is not a cost-effective option, making knowledge editing (KE) without modifying parameters particularly necessary. We find that although existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based KE methods excel at editing simple knowledge, they struggle with KE in multi-hop question answering due to the issue of "edit skipping", which refers to skipping the relevant edited fact in inference. In addition to the diversity of natural language expressions of knowledge, edit skipping also arises from the mismatch between the granularity of LLMs in problem-solving and the facts in the edited memory. To address this issue, we propose a novel Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Editing method with guided decomposition (IRAKE) through the guidance from single edited facts and entire edited cases. Experimental results demonstrate that IRAKE mitigates the failure of editing caused by edit skipping and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for KE in multi-hop question answering.'}

However, clinical reports are often lengthy and filled with clinical jargon, making it difficult for domain experts to identify important aspects in the document efficiently. This paper presents the methodology we applied in the MultiClinSUM shared task for summarising clinical case documents. We used an Iterative Self-Prompting technique on large language models (LLMs) by asking LLMs to generate task-specific prompts and refine them via example-based few-shot learning. Furthermore, we used lexical and embedding space metrics, ROUGE and BERT-score, to guide the model fine-tuning with epochs. Our submission using perspective-aware ISP on GPT-4 and GPT-4o achieved ROUGE scores (46.53, 24.68, 30.77) and BERTscores (87.84, 83.25, 85.46) for (P, R, F1) from the official evaluation on 3,396 clinical case reports from various specialties extracted from open journals. The high BERTscore indicates that the model produced semantically equivalent output summaries compared to the references, even though the overlap at the exact lexicon level is lower, as reflected in the lower ROUGE scores.

Thereafter, DK2R uses an LLM to evaluate each knowledge type's utility by analyzing LLM-generated provisional probe responses. Moreover, DK2R separately summarizes the intention-oriented key clues via dedicated reasoning, which are further used as auxiliary signals to enhance LLM-based textual response generation. Extensive experiments conducted on a public dataset verify the superiority of DK2R. We have released the codes and parameters."}

It is therefore beneficial to develop an efficient method that can automatically extract training instances from unlabeled texts for training RE models. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been adopted in various natural language processing tasks, with RE also benefiting from their advances. However, when leveraging LLMs for RE with predefined relation categories, two key challenges arise. First, in a multi-class classification setting, LLMs often struggle to comprehensively capture the semantics of every relation, leading to suboptimal results. Second, although employing binary classification for each relation individually can mitigate this issue, it introduces significant computational overhead, resulting in impractical time complexity for real-world applications. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework called M-BRe to extract training instances from unlabeled texts for RE. It utilizes three modules to combine the advantages of both of the above classification approaches: Relation Grouping, Relation Extraction, and Label Decision. Extensive experiments confirm its superior capability in discovering high-quality training samples from unlabeled texts for RE.'}

Using GPT-Judger and further human validation, we introduce the Factuality-Weighted Score (FWS), a composite metric prioritizing factual accuracy beyond coherence to guide watermarking deployment in medical domains.

It covers a diverse set of tasks, including Emotion Classification, Emotion Detection, Emotion QA, Emotion Conversation, Emotion Summary, and Emotion Expression. On average, the input length for these tasks reaches 8,777 tokens, with long-form generation required for Emotion Expression. To enhance performance under realistic constraints, we incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Collaborative Emotional Modeling (CoEM), and compare them with standard prompt-based methods. Unlike conventional approaches, our RAG method leverages both the conversation context and the large language model itself as retrieval sources, avoiding reliance on external knowledge bases. The CoEM method further improves performance by decomposing the task into five stages, integrating both retrieval augmentation and limited knowledge injection. Experimental results show that both RAG and CoEM consistently enhance EI-related performance across most long-context tasks, advancing LLMs toward more practical and real-world EI applications.

These developments have led to more direct communication between humans and LLMs in various situations, such as social companionship and psychological support. However, LLMs often exhibit limitations in emotional perception and social competence during real-world conversations. These limitations partly originate from their inability to adapt their communication style and emotional expression to different social and task contexts. In this work, we introduce PersonaFuse, a novel LLM post-training framework that enables LLMs to adapt and express different personalities for varying situations. Inspired by Trait Activation Theory and the Big Five personality model, PersonaFuse employs a Mixture-of-Expert architecture that combines persona adapters with a dynamic routing network, enabling contextual trait expression. Experimental results show that PersonaFuse substantially outperforms baseline models across multiple dimensions of social-emotional intelligence. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing general reasoning ability or model safety, which remain common limitations of direct prompting and supervised fine-tuning approaches. PersonaFuse also delivers consistent improvements in downstream human-centered applications, such as mental health counseling and review-based customer service. Finally, human preference evaluations against leading LLMs, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, demonstrate that PersonaFuse achieves competitive response quality despite its comparatively smaller model size. These findings demonstrate that PersonaFuse~offers a theoretically grounded and practical approach for developing social-emotional enhanced LLMs, marking a significant advancement toward more human-centric AI systems.'}

Traditional methods convert the document into text for processing by Large Language Models (LLMs), but this process strips away critical multi-modal information like figures. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) address this limitation, their constrained input size makes multi-page document comprehension infeasible. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods mitigate this by selecting relevant pages, but they rely solely on semantic relevance, ignoring logical connections between pages and the query, which is essential for reasoning.\nTo this end, we propose MoLoRAG, a logic-aware retrieval framework for multi-modal, multi-page document understanding. By constructing a page graph that captures contextual relationships between pages, a lightweight VLM performs graph traversal to retrieve relevant pages, including those with logical connections often overlooked. This approach combines semantic and logical relevance to deliver more accurate retrieval. After retrieval, the top-$K$ pages are fed into arbitrary LVLMs for question answering. To enhance flexibility, MoLoRAG offers two variants: a training-free solution for easy deployment and a fine-tuned version to improve logical relevance checking.

These rules are encoded in a lightweight Prolog engine, where uncertainty levels (low, medium, high) trigger aligned system actions with plain-language rationales.

In this work, we introduce Astra, the first LLM-based multi-agent system for GPU kernel optimization. Unlike previous approaches, Astra starts from existing CUDA implementations extracted from SGLang, a widely deployed framework for serving LLMs, rather than treating PyTorch modules as the specification. Within Astra, specialized LLM agents collaborate through iterative code generation, testing, profiling, and planning to produce kernels that are both correct and high-performance. On kernels from SGLang, Astra achieves an average speedup of 1.32x using zero-shot prompting with OpenAI o4-mini.

However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy. Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods, we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain And Match.

Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations', 'authors': 'Sihyun Park', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07311', 'abstract': "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been driven by pretraining, supervised fine tuning (SFT), and alignment tuning. Among these, SFT plays a crucial role in transforming a model 's general knowledge into structured responses tailored to specific tasks. However, there is no clearly established methodology for effective training data selection. Simply increasing the volume of data does not guarantee performance improvements, while preprocessing, sampling, and validation require substantial time and cost.\nTo address this issue, a variety of data selection methods have been proposed. Among them, knowledge based selection approaches identify suitable training data by analyzing the model 's responses. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on prompt engineering, making them sensitive to variations and incurring additional costs for prompt design.\nIn this study, we propose Knowledge Analysis via Model Internal Representations (KAMIR), a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by analyzing data based on the model 's internal representations. KAMIR computes similarities between the hidden states of each layer (block) and the final hidden states for a given input to assess the data. Unlike prior methods that were largely limited to multiple choice tasks, KAMIR can be applied to a wide range of tasks such as machine reading comprehension and summarization. Moreover, it selects data useful for training based on the model 's familiarity with the input, even with a small dataset and a simple classifier architecture. Experiments across diverse task datasets demonstrate that training with less familiar data leads to better generalization performance."}

Despite their success, LLM-based methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases. (1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking (MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. The source code is available at: this https URL"}

On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency. We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models.

If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging further reasoning when uncertainty persists.

Importantly, extended multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty thresholds and efficiency.

To construct poisoned documents, we propose ImportSnare, a novel attack framework employing two synergistic strategies: 1)Position-aware beam search optimizes hidden ranking sequences to elevate poisoned documents in retrieval results, and 2)Multilingual inductive suggestions generate jailbreaking sequences to manipulate LLMs into recommending malicious dependencies. Through extensive experiments across Python, Rust, and JavaScript, ImportSnare achieves significant attack success rates (over 50% for popular libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn) in general, and is also able to succeed even when the poisoning ratio is as low as 0.01%, targeting both custom and real-world malicious packages. Our findings reveal critical supply chain risks in LLM-powered development, highlighting inadequate security alignment for code generation tasks. To support future research, we will release the multilingual benchmark suite and datasets. The project homepage is this https URL."}

This study explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools, especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts. Secondly, we create a web application by integrating OpenAI's API to facilitate automated script generation from LLM-processed responses. The research focuses on the effectiveness of AI-enabled exploitation by comparing automated and manual penetration testing protocols, by determining LLM weaknesses and strengths along the way. We also provide security suggestions of AI-enabled exploitation, including ethical factors and potential misuse. The findings exhibit that while LLMs can significantly streamline the workflow of exploitation, they need to be controlled by humans to ensure accuracy and ethical application. This study adds to the increasing body of literature on AI-powered cybersecurity and its effect on ethical hacking, security research, and mobile device security."}

However, they can generate off-topic, discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract) theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment problem-solution space."}

Code refactoring improves software quality without changing external behavior. Despite its advantages, its benefits are hindered by the considerable cost of time, resources, and continuous effort it demands. Aim. Understanding why developers refactor, and which metrics capture these motivations, may support wider and more effective use of refactoring in practice. Method. We performed a large-scale empirical study to analyze developers refactoring activity, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify underlying motivations from version control data, comparing our findings with previous motivations reported in the literature. Results. LLMs matched human judgment in 80% of cases, but aligned with literature-based motivations in only 47%. They enriched 22% of motivations with more detailed rationale, often highlighting readability, clarity, and structural improvements. Most motivations were pragmatic, focused on simplification and maintainability. While metrics related to developer experience and code readability ranked highest, their correlation with motivation categories was weak. Conclusions. We conclude that LLMs effectively capture surface-level motivations but struggle with architectural reasoning. Their value lies in providing localized explanations, which, when combined with software metrics, can form hybrid approaches. Such integration offers a promising path toward prioritizing refactoring more systematically and balancing short-term improvements with long-term architectural goals.'}

User queries, however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost. Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures, identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches.'}

Our prompt engineering strategy scales to over 70 environment variables, and sim-to-real distillation enables successful policy transfer to a tactile-enabled fully actuated four-fingered dexterous robot hand. Text2Touch significantly outperforms a carefully tuned human-engineered baseline, demonstrating superior rotation speed and stability while relying on reward functions that are an order of magnitude shorter and simpler.

A holistically optimized framework is introduced for five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B, DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps (4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate response.

Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, malicious users can synthesize phishing emails that are free from spelling mistakes and other easily detectable features. Furthermore, such models can generate topic-specific phishing messages, tailoring content to the target domain and increasing the likelihood of success.\nDetecting such content remains a significant challenge, as LLM-generated phishing emails often lack clear or distinguishable linguistic features. As a result, most existing semantic-level detection approaches struggle to identify them reliably. While certain LLM-based detection methods have shown promise, they suffer from high computational costs and are constrained by the performance of the underlying language model, making them impractical for large-scale deployment.\nIn this work, we aim to address this issue. We propose Paladin, which embeds trigger-tag associations into vanilla LLM using various insertion strategies, creating them into instrumented LLMs. When an instrumented LLM generates content related to phishing, it will automatically include detectable tags, enabling easier identification. Based on the design on implicit and explicit triggers and tags, we consider four distinct scenarios in our work. We evaluate our method from three key perspectives: stealthiness, effectiveness, and robustness, and compare it with existing baseline methods. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the baselines, achieving over 90% detection accuracy across all scenarios.'}

This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency, outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we map Tessa\'s failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls. The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.'}

As a case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors. Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\\% confidence intervals, enabling effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and enhance forecasting robustness."}

Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models."}
