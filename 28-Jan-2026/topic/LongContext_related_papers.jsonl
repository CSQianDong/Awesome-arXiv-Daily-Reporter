{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2601.19193', 'title': 'CoReTab: Improving Multimodal Table Understanding with Code-driven Reasoning', 'authors': 'Van-Quang Nguyen, Takayuki Okatani', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19193', 'abstract': 'Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.'}

Although recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong translation capabilities, their effectiveness for APE--especially under document-level context--remains insufficiently understood. We present a systematic comparison of proprietary and open-weight LLMs under a naive document-level prompting setup, analyzing APE quality, contextual behavior, robustness, and efficiency.\nOur results show that proprietary LLMs achieve near human-level APE quality even with simple one-shot prompting, regardless of whether document context is provided. While these models exhibit higher robustness to data poisoning attacks than open-weight counterparts, this robustness also reveals a limitation: they largely fail to exploit document-level context for contextual error correction. Furthermore, standard automatic metrics do not reliably reflect these qualitative improvements, highlighting the continued necessity of human evaluation. Despite their strong performance, the substantial cost and latency overheads of proprietary LLMs render them impractical for real-world APE deployment. Overall, our findings elucidate both the promise and current limitations of LLM-based document-aware APE, and point toward the need for more efficient long-context modeling approaches for translation refinement.'}

Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.'}
