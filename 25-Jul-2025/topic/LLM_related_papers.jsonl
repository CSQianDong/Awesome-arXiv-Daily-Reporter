However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO), a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs. WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it accelerates inference by 6$\\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\\times$ speedup with higher performance. More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and provide an in-depth understanding of WINO."}

However, their performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats, remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and analysing Arabic structured data.'}

To address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs' attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.

TDR decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task dataset.

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model\'s reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector.

In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore, we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in the system prompt.

Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of performance.

Prior case retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR. LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.'}

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors, overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision. Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514 with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities."}

Inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly more prudent, while moderately more intelligent.

Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious documents and achieve high-precision filtering.

This sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias. Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt -- and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of 81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of 87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off relative to our original early-stopping method."}

Specifically, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and multimodal diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion as creative agents that engage designers in iterative cycles of proposal, critique, and revision.'}

Traditional deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes. Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes, helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity."}

Yet little is known about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios, and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability. The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9 percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable, transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational practice."}
