A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\\sim$3 hours ($\\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis."}

Bridging this gap often requires guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and preference learning.

The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal, the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation. The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics, computer science, and ethics.

With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities.

We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission).

Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer."}

A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.'}

To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, which projects the same image into different latent features based on timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features, the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results with only a single step."}

Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to 15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2) Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top 20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4) Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners can use before costly RL fine-tuning.'}

In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply, these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.'}

Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin optimisation problem in $\\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with $K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over the literature.

To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of climate change.

By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential."}

This paper introduces Vevo2, a unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5 Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2 consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control. Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice. Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody, we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility.

This work introduces \\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning.

To address this issue, we propose REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions.

By quantifying the information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant re-computation.

To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities, reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA) to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual modalities before late-fusing them.

Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete, error-prone, or overly general.\nIn this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep learning KT architectures.\nWe demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved predictive performance.

These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\\%$ under increased uncertainty.

A significant challenge is presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability among individuals.

In this paper, we identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers, ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.'}

We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal data.

To mitigate these challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters, resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods.

It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.'}

In this paper, we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences, thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations. Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e., ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of millions of POIs and users."}

In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text.

However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency function representation can significantly improve the performance of the learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation on a wide range of scenarios.

Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory, demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in model merging.'}

However, LLMs alone face significant limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory. To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration, all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance, we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow."}

While several dirty-label attacks that achieve high attack success rates (ASR) have been proposed, clean-label attacks are inherently more difficult. In this paper, we propose three sample selection strategies to improve attack effectiveness in clean-label scenarios: Minimum, Above50, and Below50. Our strategies identify those samples which the model predicts incorrectly or with low confidence, and by injecting backdoor triggers into such samples, we aim to induce a stronger association between the trigger patterns and the attacker-desired target label. We apply our methods to clean-label variants of four canonical backdoor attacks (InsertSent, WordInj, StyleBkd, SynBkd) and evaluate them on three datasets (IMDB, SST2, HateSpeech) and four model types (LSTM, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa). Results show that the proposed strategies, particularly the Minimum strategy, significantly improve the ASR over random sample selection with little or no degradation in the model's clean accuracy. Furthermore, clean-label attacks enhanced by our strategies outperform BITE, a state of the art clean-label attack method, in many configurations."}

While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.\nWe find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research."}

Traditional deterministic (point) forecasting methods are inadequate for capturing the full spectrum of potential volatility outcomes, underscoring the importance of probabilistic approaches.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to propose and systematically evaluate probabilistic forecasts of variance in cryptocurrency markets based on predictions derived from multiple base models. Our empirical results for Bitcoin demonstrate that the Quantile Estimation through Residual Simulation (QRS) method, particularly when applied to linear base models operating on log-transformed realized volatility data, consistently outperforms more sophisticated alternatives. Additionally, we highlight the robustness of the probabilistic stacking framework, providing comprehensive insights into uncertainty and risk inherent in cryptocurrency volatility forecasting.

In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache, eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks.

DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.

To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT.

We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically, by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the LLMs' system prompt.

This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question, text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations. Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94% accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1 Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic readiness in Brazil.'}

To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced. However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems. First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench. To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements (e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.'}

The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.\nAcross a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.\nOur findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic inference.

While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model\'s high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.'}

Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%).

Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or reasoning-distilled) models.

The goal of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal, face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\nTo overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality of our method.'}

To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\\% relative increase in user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.'}

Articles have emphasized the effect of AI on the cyber offense-defense balance, and commentators can be found arguing either that cyber will privilege attackers or defenders. For defenders, arguments are often made that AI will enable solutions like formal verification of all software--and for some well-equipped companies, this may be true. This conversation, however, does not match the reality for most companies. "Trailing-edge organizations," as we term them, rely heavily on legacy software, poorly staff security roles, and struggle to implement best practices like rapid deployment of security patches. These decisions may be the result of corporate inertia, but may also be the result of a seemingly-rational calculation that attackers may not bother targeting a firm due to lack of economic incentives, and as a result, underinvestment in defense will not be punished.\nThis approach to security may have been sufficient prior to the development of AI systems, but it is unlikely to remain viable in the near future. We argue that continuing improvements in AI\'s capabilities poses additional risks on two fronts: First, increased usage of AI will alter the economics of the marginal cyberattack and expose these trailing-edge organizations to more attackers, more frequently. Second, AI\'s advances will enable attackers to develop exploits and launch attacks earlier than they can today--meaning that it is insufficient for these companies to attain parity with today\'s leading defenders, but must instead aim for faster remediation timelines and more resilient software. The situation today portends a dramatically increased number of attacks in the near future. Moving forward, we offer a range of solutions for both organizations and governments to improve the defensive posture of firms which lag behind their peers today.'}

Second, we recursively prompt the model to transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting.

Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.\nWe introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models.\nOur findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing, and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.'}

Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios. Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.'}

Manual calculation of shares under numerous scenarios is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to assist with complex legal reasoning tasks. This study evaluates the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs to interpret and apply Islamic inheritance laws. We utilized the dataset proposed in the ArabicNLP QIAS 2025 challenge, which includes inheritance case scenarios given in Arabic and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to 92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025 challenge.'}

However, existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in ancient Chinese NLP.'}

This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts (CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs. Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process, which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization (DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.'}

This paper presents an AI-driven approach that leverages Vision Transformers (ViTs) to automatically classify children's engagement using visual cues such as gaze direction, interaction, and peer collaboration. Utilizing the Child-Play gaze dataset, our method is trained on annotated video segments to classify behavioral and collaborative engagement states (e.g., engaged, not engaged, collaborative, not collaborative). We evaluated three state-of-the-art transformer models: Vision Transformer (ViT), Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), and Swin Transformer. Among these, the Swin Transformer achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 97.58%, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling local and global attention. Our results highlight the potential of transformer-based architectures for scalable, automated engagement analysis in real-world educational settings."}
