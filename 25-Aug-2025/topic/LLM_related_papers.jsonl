The dataset draws on Modern Standard Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal reasoning.

However, deploying these models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero- and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and maintainable classification systems in industry applications.'}

We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.'}

However, the mechanisms underlying how and why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp - \\alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$ represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\\alpha$ determines the rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus paving the way for further explorations.'}

Such semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e., reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.'}

However, existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics, often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\\%$ under increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.'}

XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and locale-sensitive cases.

Statement B is", which requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits that mechanistically explain GPT-2\'s logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads. Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model\'s performance. By relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in mechanistic interpretability.'}

In this paper, we propose Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks, including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs, and plain text.

To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT.

Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies."}

Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA, the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015 through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs, including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.'}

To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM, significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision. DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%.

The role of disability cues in shaping these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters. Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.\nAcross a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess in up to 97\\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone does not mitigate stereotype amplification.\nOur findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment strategies.

While recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the "Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However, this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel "Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning, leveraging the model\'s high-frequency token processing capability. Although interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.'}

Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization (DPO) on $\\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain and out-of-domain conversations.

Third, we validate each synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating substantial gains over zero-shot prompting.

Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\nTo overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt compression method.

We design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio, compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the compression ratio.

Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025 shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.'}

Large Language Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally, promoting misinformation or biased narratives.\nWe introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models. Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with additional models.\nOur findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing, and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.'}

Several psychological models have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.'}

However, systematic biases toward particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.\nIn this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora. These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous data processing systems."}

Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs. Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process, which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization (DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities."}

The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.'}

Here, we test whether measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length, (ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of uncertainty (e.g., $\\textit{guess}$, $\\textit{stuck}$, $\\textit{hard}$) in the CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\\approx 70\\%$), and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\\approx 9\\%$), indicating that CoT length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks, i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.

With the astounding advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE.

Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task, RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in low-data settings."}

Although these studies have driven the progress in LLMs' safety alignment, it remains unclear whether LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\\&A to investigate the misuse threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential."}

However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets. Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent, context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems. Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities, personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to limited data availability.'}

This transition makes their ability to use external tools a critical capability. However, evaluating this skill presents a significant challenge. Existing benchmarks are often limited by their reliance on synthetic tools and severely constrained action spaces. To address these limitations, we introduce MCPVerse, an expansive, real-world benchmark for evaluating agentic tool use. MCPVerse integrates more than 550 real-world, executable tools to create an unprecedented action space exceeding 140k tokens, and employs outcome-based evaluation with real-time ground truth for time-sensitive tasks. We benchmarked the state-of-the-art LLMs across three modes (Oracle, Standard, and Max-Scale), revealing that while most models suffer performance degradation when confronted with larger tool sets, the agentic models, such as Claude-4-Sonnet, can effectively leverage expanded exploration spaces to improve accuracy. This finding not only exposes the limitations of state-of-the-art models in complex, real-world scenarios but also establishes MCPVerse as a critical benchmark for measuring and advancing agentic tool use capabilities.'}

This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.'}

Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.'}

It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.'}

To do so, designers often conduct iterative user testing and exploratory trial-and-error. This involves balancing multiple objectives in a high-dimensional space, making the process time-consuming and cognitively demanding. System-led optimization methods, such as those based on Bayesian optimization, can determine for designers which parameters to test next. However, they offer limited opportunities for designers to intervene in the optimization process, negatively impacting the designer's experience. We propose a design optimization framework that enables natural language interactions between designers and the optimization system, facilitating cooperative design optimization. This is achieved by integrating system-led optimization methods with Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing designers to intervene in the optimization process and better understand the system's reasoning. Experimental results show that our method provides higher user agency than a system-led method and shows promising optimization performance compared to manual design. It also matches the performance of an existing cooperative method with lower cognitive load."}

While their performance on reasoning and optimization tasks has been extensively evaluated, less attention has been paid to their ability to simulate human decision-making's variability and adaptability. We propose a process-oriented evaluation framework with progressive interventions (Intrinsicality, Instruction, and Imitation) to examine how LLM agents adapt under different levels of external guidance and human-derived noise. We validate the framework on two classic economics tasks, irrationality in the second-price auction and decision bias in the newsvendor problem, showing behavioral gaps between LLMs and humans.\nWe find that LLMs, by default, converge on stable and conservative strategies that diverge from observed human behaviors. Risk-framed instructions impact LLM behavior predictably but do not replicate human-like diversity. Incorporating human data through in-context learning narrows the gap but fails to reach human subjects' strategic variability. These results highlight a persistent alignment gap in behavioral fidelity and suggest that future LLM evaluations should consider more process-level realism. We present a process-oriented approach for assessing LLMs in dynamic decision-making tasks, offering guidance for their application in synthetic data for social science research."}

Yet, though prior work has shown LLMs to be capable of identifying emotional connections and recognizing reciprocity in trust games, little remains known about (i) how different strategies to build trust compare, (ii) how such trust can be measured implicitly, and (iii) how this relates to explicit measures of trust.\nWe study these questions by relating implicit measures of trust, i.e. susceptibility to persuasion and propensity to collaborate financially, with explicit measures of trust, i.e. a dyadic trust questionnaire well-established in psychology. We build trust in three ways: by building rapport dynamically, by starting from a prewritten script that evidences trust, and by adapting the LLMs' system prompt. Surprisingly, we find that the measures of explicit trust are either little or highly negatively correlated with implicit trust measures. These findings suggest that measuring trust between LLMs by asking their opinion may be deceiving. Instead, context-specific and implicit measures may be more informative in understanding how LLMs trust each other."}
