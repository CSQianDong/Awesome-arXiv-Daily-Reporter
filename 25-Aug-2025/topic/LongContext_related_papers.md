**Abstract**: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising 11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents; instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration, reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning across multiple documents.

# An Auditable Pipeline for Fuzzy Full-Text Screening in Systematic Reviews: Integrating Contrastive Semantic Highlighting and LLM Judgment

**Abstract**: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN). Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach), we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM) judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores, and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of 81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines (43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and end-to-end traceability.

# SurfaceLogicKV: Surface and Logic Attention Behaviors are All You Need for Robust KV Cache Compression 

**Authors**: Mengjie Li, William J. Song  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15806)  

**Abstract**: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or even FullKV in some specific situations

# Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records

**Abstract**: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities.
