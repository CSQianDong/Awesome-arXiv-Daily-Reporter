Most benchmarks focus on final outcomes but overlook the intermediate reasoning steps - such as planning, revision, and decision making under resource constraints. We argue that measuring these internal processes is essential for understanding model behavior and improving reliability. We propose using strategic games as a natural evaluation environment: closed, rule-based systems with clear states, limited resources, and automatic feedback. We introduce a framework that evaluates LLMs along three core dimensions: planning, revision, and resource-constrained decision making. To operationalize this, we define metrics beyond win rate, including overcorrection risk rate, correction success rate, improvement slope, and over-budget ratio. In 4320 adversarial rounds across 12 leading models, ChatGPT-o3-mini achieves the top composite score, with a win rate of 74.7 percent, a correction success rate of 78.6 percent, and an improvement slope of 0.041. By contrast, Qwen-Plus, despite an overcorrection risk rate of 81.6 percent, wins only 25.6 percent of its matches - primarily due to excessive resource use. We also observe a negative correlation between overcorrection risk rate and correction success rate (Pearson r = -0.51, p = 0.093), suggesting that more frequent edits do not always improve outcomes. Our findings highlight the value of assessing not only what LLMs decide but how they arrive at those decisions'}

This limitation arises because of the difficulty in acquiring a high-quality reasoning sample for downstream tasks. To address this, we propose Schema-R1, a reasoning schema linking model trained using reinforcement learning. Specifically, Schema-R1 consists of three key steps: constructing small batches of high-quality reasoning samples, supervised fine-tuning for cold-start initialization, and rule-based reinforcement learning training. The final results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances the reasoning ability of the schema linking model, achieving a 10\\% improvement in filter accuracy compared to the existing method.

In this work, we present a cascaded LLM decision framework that adaptively delegates tasks across multiple tiers of expertise -- a base model for initial candidate answers, a more capable and knowledgeable (but costlier) large model, and a human expert for when the model cascade abstains. Our method proceeds in two stages. First, a deferral policy determines whether to accept the base model's answer or regenerate it with the large model based on the confidence score. Second, an abstention policy decides whether the cascade model response is sufficiently certain or requires human intervention. Moreover, we incorporate an online learning mechanism in the framework that can leverage human feedback to improve decision quality over time. We demonstrate this approach to general question-answering (ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge) and medical question-answering (MedQA and MedMCQA). Our results show that our cascaded strategy outperforms in most cases single-model baselines in accuracy while reducing cost and providing a principled way to handle abstentions."}

Our results show that LLMs effectively leverage hedonic variables, such as property size and amenities, to produce meaningful estimates. While traditional machine learning models remain strong for pure predictive accuracy, LLMs offer a more accessible, interactive and interpretable alternative. Although self-explanations require cautious interpretation, we find that LLMs explain their predictions in agreement with state-of-the-art models, confirming their trustworthiness. Carefully selected in-context examples based on feature similarity and geographic proximity, significantly enhance LLM performance, yet LLMs struggle with overconfidence in price intervals and limited spatial reasoning.

To address these limitations, we propose a Symmetric Multimodal Preference Optimization (SymMPO), which conducts symmetric preference learning with direct preference supervision (i.e., response pairs) for visual understanding enhancement, while maintaining rigorous theoretical alignment with standard DPO. In addition to conventional ordinal preference learning, SymMPO introduces a preference margin consistency loss to quantitatively regulate the preference gap between symmetric preference pairs. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmarks demonstrate SymMPO's superior performance, validating its effectiveness in hallucination mitigation of MLLMs."}

The benchmark includes over 2,000 open-ended questions grounded in 486 images, ensuring that models must integrate visual interpretation with factual reasoning rather than rely on superficial textual cues. We evaluate thirteen state-of-the-art open-weight VLMs across multiple dimensions, including domain-specific accuracy and performance on adversarial crafted questions. Our findings reveal that even the strongest models achieve less than 45% overall accuracy, with particularly poor performance in music, mathematics, and adversarial settings. Furthermore, the results indicate significant discrepancies between success on popular benchmarks and real-world multimodal understanding. We conclude that middle school-level tasks offer a meaningful and underutilized avenue for stress-testing VLMs, especially in non-English contexts.

We propose a test-time collaboration framework in which a planner model first generates a plan, defined as a distilled and high-level abstraction of the problem.\nThis plan serves as a lightweight intermediate that guides a reasoner model, which generates a complete solution. Small and large models take turns acting as planner and reasoner, exchanging plans in a multi-round cascade to collaboratively solve complex tasks.

In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.'}

While AI has advanced in various creative domains, its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers. Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.'}

Unlike traditional web resources, autonomous AI agents initiate actions, maintain persistent state, spawn sub-agents, and negotiate directly with peers: demanding millisecond-level discovery, instant credential revocation, and cryptographic behavioral proofs that exceed current DNS/PKI capabilities. This paper analyzes whether to upgrade existing infrastructure or implement purpose-built registry architectures for autonomous agents. We identify critical failure points: DNS propagation (24-48 hours vs. required milliseconds), certificate revocation unable to scale to trillions of entities, and IPv4/IPv6 addressing inadequate for agent-scale routing. We evaluate three approaches: (1) Upgrade paths, (2) Switch options, (3) Hybrid registries. Drawing parallels to dialup-to-broadband transitions, we find that agent requirements constitute qualitative, and not incremental, changes. While upgrades offer compatibility and faster deployment, clean-slate solutions provide better performance but require longer for adoption. Our analysis suggests hybrid approaches will emerge, with centralized registries for critical agents and federated meshes for specialized use cases.'}

This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process, enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses only 30\\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar, +7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.'}

When tested on the field, one can only use the labels available at the time of training and testing (e.g. seen and assumed negatives). As vulnerabilities are discovered across calendar time, labels change and past performance is not necessarily aligned with future performance. Past works only considered the slices of the whole history (e.g. DiverseVUl) or individual differences between releases (e.g. Jimenez et al. ESEC/FSE 2019). Such approaches are either too optimistic in training (e.g. the whole history) or too conservative (e.g. consecutive releases). We propose a method to restructure a dataset into a series of datasets in which both training and testing labels change to account for the knowledge available at the time. If the model is actually learning, it should improve its performance over time as more data becomes available and data becomes more stable, an effect that can be checked with the Mann-Kendall test. We validate our methodology for vulnerability detection with 4 time-based datasets (3 projects from BigVul dataset + Vuldeepecker's NVD) and 5 ML models (Code2Vec, CodeBERT, LineVul, ReGVD, and Vuldeepecker).

A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions.

Moreover, the ego-vehicle employs a longitudinal braking action to ensure the safety of both itself and the surrounding vehicles. Our architecture consists of two modules: (i) a perception module that senses the environment, derives input numerical features, and converts them into linguistic categories; and communicates them to the prediction module; (ii) a pretrained prediction module that executes a KGE and Bayesian inference model to anticipate the target vehicle's maneuver and transforms the prediction into longitudinal braking action.

This phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance."}

This literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic, real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning models.

We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy.

Despite their promise, the robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops. Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid, equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field."}

A Synthetic Data Investigation', 'authors': 'Gregor Baer, Isel Grau, Chao Zhang, Pieter Van Gorp', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11790', 'abstract': 'Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects" raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.'}

To address this challenge, we introduce a standard anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables.

However, much of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct groups.

This paper investigates the performance of GPT-4o in repairing Java vulnerabilities from a widely used dataset (Vul4J), exploring how different contextual information affects automated vulnerability repair (AVR) capabilities. We compare the latest GPT-4o's performance against previous results with GPT-4 using identical prompts. We evaluated nine additional prompts crafted by us that contain various contextual information such as CWE or CVE information, and manually extracted code contexts. Each prompt was executed three times on 42 vulnerabilities, and the resulting fix candidates were validated using Vul4J's automated testing framework.\nOur results show that GPT-4o performed 11.9\\% worse on average than GPT-4 with the same prompt, but was able to fix 10.5\\% more distinct vulnerabilities in the three runs together. CVE information significantly improved repair rates, while the length of the task description had minimal impact.

Proper testing not only increases code coverage and prevents regressions but it can also ensure that any potential vulnerabilities in the software are identified and effectively fixed.

To help developers and security experts, this paper explores the automatic unit test generation capability of one of the most widely used large language models, GPT-4, from the perspective of vulnerabilities. We examine a subset of the VUL4J dataset containing real vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes to determine whether GPT-4 can generate syntactically and/or semantically correct unit tests based on the code before and after the fixes as evidence of vulnerability mitigation. We focus on the impact of code contexts, the effectiveness of GPT-4's self-correction ability, and the subjective usability of the generated test cases. Our results indicate that GPT-4 can generate syntactically correct test cases 66.5\\% of the time without domain-specific pre-training. Although the semantic correctness of the fixes could be automatically validated in only 7. 5\\% of the cases, our subjective evaluation shows that GPT-4 generally produces test templates that can be further developed into fully functional vulnerability-witnessing tests with relatively minimal manual effort.\nTherefore, despite the limited data, our initial findings suggest that GPT-4 can be effectively used in the generation of vulnerability-witnessing tests. It may not operate entirely autonomously, but it certainly plays a significant role in a partially automated process."}

This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.

I investigate whether BERT encodes abstract relational schemata by examining internal representations of concept pairs across taxonomic, mereological, and functional relations. I compare BERT's relational classification performance with representational structure in [CLS] token embeddings. Results reveal that pretrained BERT enables high classification accuracy, indicating latent relational signals. However, concept pairs organize by relation type in high-dimensional embedding space only after fine-tuning on supervised relation classification tasks. This indicates relational schemata are not emergent from pretraining alone but can be induced via task scaffolding. These findings demonstrate that behavioral performance does not necessarily imply structured conceptual understanding, though models can acquire inductive biases for grounded relational abstraction through appropriate training."}

Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality, widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability, we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers.

However, the efficacy of RLVR diminishes significantly when applied to agentic environments. These settings, characterized by multi-step, complex problem solving, lead to high failure rates even for frontier LLMs, as the reward landscape is too sparse for effective model training via conventional RLVR. In this work, we introduce Agent-RLVR, a framework that makes RLVR effective in challenging agentic settings, with an initial focus on software engineering tasks. Inspired by human pedagogy, Agent-RLVR introduces agent guidance, a mechanism that actively steers the agent towards successful trajectories by leveraging diverse informational cues. These cues, ranging from high-level strategic plans to dynamic feedback on the agent's errors and environmental interactions, emulate a teacher's guidance, enabling the agent to navigate difficult solution spaces and promotes active self-improvement via additional environment exploration. In the Agent-RLVR training loop, agents first attempt to solve tasks to produce initial trajectories, which are then validated by unit tests and supplemented with agent guidance. Agents then reattempt with guidance, and the agent policy is updated with RLVR based on the rewards of these guided trajectories. Agent-RLVR elevates the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct from 9.4% to 22.4% on SWE-Bench Verified.

While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second, for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence improving robustness."}

However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o.

In this paper, we propose Avey, a new neural foundational architecture that breaks away from both attention and recurrence. Avey comprises a ranker and an autoregressive neural processor, which collaboratively identify and contextualize only the most relevant tokens for any given token, regardless of their positions in the sequence.

In enterprise deployments these systems need to interact with API collections that can be extremely large and complex, often backed by databases. In order to create datasets with such characteristics, we explore how existing NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL query) datasets can be used to automatically create NL2API datasets. Specifically, this work describes a novel data generation pipeline that exploits the syntax of SQL queries to construct a functionally equivalent sequence of API calls. We apply this pipeline to one of the largest NL2SQL datasets, BIRD-SQL to create a collection of over 2500 APIs that can be served as invocable tools or REST-endpoints. We pair natural language queries from BIRD-SQL to ground-truth API sequences based on this API pool. We use this collection to study the performance of 10 public LLMs and find that all models struggle to determine the right set of tools (consisting of tasks of intent detection, sequencing with nested function calls, and slot-filling). We find that models have extremely low task completion rates (7-47 percent - depending on the dataset) which marginally improves to 50 percent when models are employed as ReACT agents that interact with the live API environment. The best task completion rates are far below what may be required for effective general-use tool-calling agents, suggesting substantial scope for improvement in current state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. We also conduct detailed ablation studies, such as assessing the impact of the number of tools available as well as the impact of tool and slot-name obfuscation.

Were TSFMs to achieve a level of generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions: (1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited} generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates. While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design, particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and scalable solutions for BEM.'}

We provide surprising evidence that while overall reasoning capabilities increase with model sophistication, the nature of errors increasingly mirrors predictable human reasoning fallacies: a previously unobserved inverse scaling phenomenon. To investigate this question, we apply the Erotetic Theory of Reasoning (ETR), a formal cognitive framework with empirical support for predicting human reasoning outcomes. Using the open-source package PyETR, we generate logical reasoning problems where humans predictably err, evaluating responses from 38 language models across 383 reasoning tasks. Our analysis indicates that as models advance in general capability (as measured by Chatbot Arena scores), the proportion of their incorrect answers that align with ETR-predicted human fallacies tends to increase ($\\rho = 0.360, p = 0.0265$). Notably, as we observe no correlation between model sophistication and logical correctness on these tasks, this shift in error patterns toward human-likeness occurs independently of error rate. These findings challenge the prevailing view that scaling language models naturally obtains normative rationality, suggesting instead a convergence toward human-like cognition inclusive of our characteristic biases and limitations, as we further confirm by demonstrating order-effects in language model reasoning.'}

To address this issue, we introduce a self-distillation loss during the pruning phase (rather than post-training) to fully exploit the predictions of the original model, thereby obtaining more accurate gradient information for pruning. Moreover, we find that, compared to attention modules, the predictions of LLM are less sensitive to multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which take up more than $5 \\times$ parameters (LLaMA3.2-1.2B). To this end, we focus on the pruning of MLP modules, to significantly compress LLM without obvious performance degradation.

Specifically, Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing PKT solutions.

However, this approach still lags behind dedicated fine-tuning, where a separate model is trained for each individual task.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, Many-Shot In-Context Fine-tuning (ManyICL), which significantly narrows this performance gap by extending the principles of ICL to a many-shot setting. To unlock the full potential of ManyICL and address the inherent inefficiency of processing long sequences with numerous in-context examples, we propose a novel training objective. Instead of solely predicting the final answer, our approach treats every answer within the context as a supervised training target. This effectively shifts the role of many-shot examples from prompts to targets for autoregressive learning. Through extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks, including classification, summarization, question answering, natural language inference, and math, we demonstrate that ManyICL substantially outperforms zero/few-shot fine-tuning and approaches the performance of dedicated fine-tuning.

However, existing evaluation frameworks often blur the distinctions between LLM chatbots and AI agents, leading to confusion among researchers selecting appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a systematic analysis of current evaluation approaches, grounded in an evolutionary perspective. We provide a detailed analytical framework that clearly differentiates AI agents from LLM chatbots along five key aspects: complex environment, multi-source instructor, dynamic feedback, multi-modal perception, and advanced capability. Further, we categorize existing evaluation benchmarks based on external environments driving forces, and resulting advanced internal capabilities. For each category, we delineate relevant evaluation attributes, presented comprehensively in practical reference tables. Finally, we synthesize current trends and outline future evaluation methodologies through four critical lenses: environment, agent, evaluator, and metrics. Our findings offer actionable guidance for researchers, facilitating the informed selection and application of benchmarks in AI agent evaluation, thus fostering continued advancement in this rapidly evolving research domain.'}

Seal', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11100', 'abstract': 'Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns. The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about 20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.'}

Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress, these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates. Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.

This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically, PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment."}

However, they are often tested only for a limited breadth of application domains; we do not understand whether certain C-SEO methods would be effective for a broad range of domains. Moreover, existing evaluations consider only a single-actor scenario where only one web document adopts a C-SEO method; in reality, multiple players are likely to competitively adopt the cutting-edge C-SEO techniques, drawing an analogy from the dynamics we have seen in SEO. We present C-SEO Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate C-SEO methods across multiple tasks, domains, and number of actors. We consider two search tasks, question answering and product recommendation, with three domains each. We also formalize a new evaluation protocol with varying adoption rates among involved actors. Our experiments reveal that most current C-SEO methods are largely ineffective, contrary to reported results in the literature. Instead, traditional SEO strategies, those aiming to improve the ranking of the source in the LLM context, are significantly more effective.

To empirically evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (n = 49) as they read S. Collins's ''The Hunger Games'' novel. We then use the topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our approach.

Previously, we introduced an ASR postprocessing method called error detection and context-aware error correction (ED-CEC), which leverages contextual information such as named entities and technical terms to improve the accuracy of ASR transcripts. Although ED-CEC achieves a notable success in correcting rare words, its accuracy remains low when dealing with rare words that have similar pronunciations but different spellings. To address this issue, we proposed a phoneme-augmented multimodal fusion method for context-aware error correction (PMF-CEC) method on the basis of ED-CEC, which allowed for better differentiation between target rare words and homophones. Additionally, we observed that the previous ASR error detection module suffers from overdetection. To mitigate this, we introduced a retention probability mechanism to filter out editing operations with confidence scores below a set threshold, preserving the original operation to improve error detection accuracy. Experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrated that our proposed PMF-CEC maintains reasonable inference speed while further reducing the biased word error rate compared with ED-CEC, showing a stronger advantage in correcting homophones.

This raises a central question: How does the position of retrieved evidence affect multimodal RAG performance? To answer this, we present the first comprehensive study of position bias in multimodal RAG systems. Through controlled experiments across text-only, image-only, and mixed-modality tasks, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy curve with respect to evidence position. To quantify this bias, we introduce the Position Sensitivity Index ($PSI_p$) and develop a visualization framework to trace attention allocation patterns across decoder layers. Our results reveal that multimodal interactions intensify position bias compared to unimodal settings, and that this bias increases logarithmically with retrieval range.

While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper."}

Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However, traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of 98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art.

We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm.

In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers.

Supervised detection relies on large, curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1 scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects, and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations -- suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting. Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases -- indicating that it elicits more useful diversity.

However, the ability of LLMs to comprehend code written with legacy languages remains a research gap challenged by real-world legacy systems lacking or containing inaccurate documentation that may impact LLM comprehension. To assess LLM comprehension of legacy languages, there is a need for objective LLM evaluation. In order to objectively measure LLM comprehension of legacy languages, we need an efficient, quantitative evaluation method. We leverage multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), an emerging LLM evaluation methodology, to evaluate LLM comprehension of legacy code and the impact of comment prevalence and inaccurate comments. In this work, we present preliminary findings on the impact of documentation on LLM comprehension of legacy code and outline strategic objectives for future work.'}

Ngo, Mark Roantree', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11004', 'abstract': 'Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population, significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\\%. Additionally, hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.'}

This paradigm enables LLMs to be tested in tasks that bridge the gap between digital and physical systems, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of their capabilities. To evaluate LLMs on these tasks, we propose Embedbench, the first comprehensive benchmark for embedded system programming, circuit design, and cross-platform this http URL consists of 126 cases, covering 9 electronic components across 3 hardware platforms. Through extensive experiments on 10 mainstream LLMs, we uncover several key findings. Surprisingly, despite the simplicity of the cases, DeepSeek-R1 achieves only a 55.6% pass@1 rate when provided with schematic information, and 50.0% when tasked with generating the schematics itself. In the cross-platform migration tasks, LLMs show relatively strong performance with MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico (with the top model achieving 73.8% pass@1), but perform poorly on ESP-IDF, where the best model reaches only 29.4% pass@1.Interestingly, we observe that general-purpose chat LLMs like DeepSeek-V3 often fail to utilize relevant pre-trained knowledge in this domain, while reasoning LLMs tend to overthink and overlook efficient knowledge during pretraining. Based on these insights, we propose two strategies: retrieval augmented generation and compiler feedback-to enhance LLM performance. These strategies result in significant improvements, with Deepseek-R1 reaching a 65.1% pass@1 with correct schematics, and 53.1% without. Additionally, the accuracy of the Arduino to ESP32 migration task improves from 21.4% to 27.8%.'}

Bailey', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11001', 'abstract': "Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize military combat systems, but ensuring these AI-enabled capabilities are truly mission-ready presents new challenges. We argue that current technology readiness assessments fail to capture critical AI-specific factors, leading to potential risks in deployment. We propose a new AI Readiness Framework to evaluate the maturity and trustworthiness of AI components in military systems. The central thesis is that a tailored framework - analogous to traditional Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) but expanded for AI - can better gauge an AI system's reliability, safety, and suitability for combat use. Using current data evaluation tools and testing practices, we demonstrate the framework's feasibility for near-term implementation. This structured approach provides military decision-makers with clearer insight into whether an AI-enabled system has met the necessary standards of performance, transparency, and human integration to be deployed with confidence, thus advancing the field of defense technology management and risk assessment."}

We propose a framework and a tool to help validate the equivalence of COBOL and translated Java. The results can also help repair the code if there are some issues and provide feedback to the AI model to improve. We have developed a symbolic-execution-based test generation to automatically generate unit tests for the source COBOL programs which also mocks the external resource calls. We generate equivalent JUnit test cases with equivalent mocking as COBOL and run them to check semantic equivalence between original and translated programs.'}

However, existing automated testing approaches struggle to match the capabilities of human engineers due to key limitations such as test locality, lack of general reliability, and business logic blindness. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages functional programming and type systems to translate Scala backend code into formal Lean representations. Our pipeline automatically generates theorems that specify the intended behavior of APIs and database operations, and uses LLM-based provers to verify them. When a theorem is proved, the corresponding logic is guaranteed to be correct and no further testing is needed. If the negation of a theorem is proved instead, it confirms a bug. In cases where neither can be proved, human intervention is required. We evaluate our method on realistic backend systems and find that it can formally verify over 50% of the test requirements, which suggests that half of a testing engineer's workload can be automated. Additionally, with an average cost of only $2.19 per API, LLM-based verification is significantly more cost-effective than manual testing and can be scaled easily through parallel execution. Our results indicate a promising direction for scalable, AI-powered software testing, with the potential to greatly improve engineering productivity as models continue to advance."}

It involves dynamically moving workloads to regions with cleaner energy sources as demand increases and energy production relies more on fossil fuels. With the significant power consumption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) being a subject of extensive debate, FtS is proposed as a strategy to mitigate the carbon footprint of training AI models. However, the literature lacks scientific evidence on the advantages of FtS to mitigate the carbon footprint of AI workloads. In this paper, we present the results of an experiment conducted in a partial synthetic scenario to address this research gap. We benchmarked four AI algorithms in the anomaly detection domain and measured the differences in carbon emissions in four cases: no strategy, FtS, and two strategies previously introduced in the state of the art, namely Flexible Start and Pause and Resume. To conduct our experiment, we utilized historical carbon intensity data from the year 2021 for seven European cities. Our results demonstrate that the FtS strategy not only achieves average reductions of up to 14.6% in carbon emissions (with peaks of 16.3%) but also helps in preserving the time needed for training."}
