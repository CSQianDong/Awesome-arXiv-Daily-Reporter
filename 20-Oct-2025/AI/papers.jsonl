Bailey', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15772', 'abstract': "So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example, fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools, LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The `dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains."}

To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion.

Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations: the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.'}

To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy.

We developed a machine learning framework to integrate diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931 blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.'}

While large language models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool. Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$ decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards, enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale generalization and robustness to generator capacity.'}

To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training.

However, partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them. We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training, corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible, without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior."}

Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.'}

This creates two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without architectural access."}

We present a novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy, sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles, employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32 extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available, enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.'}

While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought.

Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations, definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed. We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct them."}

In this study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects (flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of what AI can contribute to creative game development processes."}

Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.'}

For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web continuously."}

In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale.

This paper aims at striking a balance between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.'}

Among these, the Lookahead family of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of model weights.

DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers, claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains of 1.5 - 2.5$\\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23 training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size.

Here, we introduce the Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences.

However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation.

Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance.

To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments."}

A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore, how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities, which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff.'}

Markosyan', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15700', 'abstract': "Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce, and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs -- struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks, reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as training data for supervised finetuning."}

Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.'}

The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of 9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved 99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses.

A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters (i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve improved retrieval performance.

Most state-of-the-art methods address this separately, first translating theorems and then generating proofs, creating a fundamental disconnect vis-a-vis true proof auto-formalization. This two-step process and its limitations were evident even in AlphaProof's silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements needed manual translation before automated proof synthesis.\nWe present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs) are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover, DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS).

The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.'}

However, these methods do not provide therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically, SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless interaction for users.

While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts.

We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of KD as we vary the dataset size.

Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions.

In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions, contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity, Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.'}

This issue is exacerbated in parallel sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution, potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up to an additional $211\\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring its exploration advantage.

Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics.

Effective and efficient scalable clone detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.\nThis paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and tailored datasets are advantageous.

Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model (specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class.

A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence.

In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single representative token.

Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain, which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation, with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and gravel, with a bucket pouring action.'}

Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.'}

While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.'}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP.

Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation.

However, in modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent, degrading $\\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically, the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as $\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as $\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}\\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\\mu$P learning-rate rule $\\eta_2\\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\\lambda_2\\propto \\sqrt{d}$ that approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like parameters trained at $\\eta_1=\\Theta_d(1)$ and $\\lambda_1=0$, this yields \\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.

However, popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently, prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this, DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points. Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift. Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.'}

We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy.

In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity (PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous, chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD) splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity (lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage (SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are reliable.

While this choice is intensely debated, its underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent\'s advantage through a "data flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the deployer\'s future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent\'s optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant\'s learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms\' strategic flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the developer\'s strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.'}

While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence.

We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs, abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral underpinnings of digital political communication.'}

We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains.

Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server, distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber threats.'}

A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models."}

We introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction. Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.

We detail our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance.'}

Even though traditional machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems, discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant financial systems."}

Christopher, Austin Seamann, Jingyi Cui, Sagar Khare, Ferdinando Fioretto', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14989', 'abstract': 'Diffusion models offer a powerful means of capturing the manifold of realistic protein structures, enabling rapid design for protein engineering tasks. However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise constraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a constrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring strict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise stereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal feasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process, scaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate on challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and vacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark dataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric constraints with no degradation in structural diversity.'}

Standard portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S. equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15 to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real markets.'}

Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals) and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally, we provide a live demo of DeepAries at this https URL, along with the source code and dataset at this https URL, illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified decision-making process."}

But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022 demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of proposed implementation in handling real tasks.'}

However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.'}

This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures."}

Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.
