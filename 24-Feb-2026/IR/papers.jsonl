Despite empirical gains, existing approaches largely drive intermediate reasoning states via target-dominant objectives without imposing explicit feasibility constraints. This results in latent drift, where reasoning trajectories deviate into implausible regions. We argue that effective recommendation reasoning should instead be viewed as navigation on a collaborative manifold rather than free-form latent refinement. To this end, we propose ManCAR (Manifold-Constrained Adaptive Reasoning), a principled framework that grounds reasoning within the topology of a global interaction graph. ManCAR constructs a local intent prior from the collaborative neighborhood of a user's recent actions, represented as a distribution over the item simplex. During training, the model progressively aligns its latent predictive distribution with this prior, forcing the reasoning trajectory to remain within the valid manifold. At test time, reasoning proceeds adaptively until the predictive distribution stabilizes, avoiding over-refinement. We provide a variational interpretation of ManCAR to theoretically validate its drift-prevention and adaptive test-time stopping mechanisms. Experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that ManCAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 46.88% relative improvement w.r.t. NDCG@10.

In industrial recommender systems, features play vital roles as they carry information for downstream models. Accurate feature importance estimation is critical because it helps identify the most useful feature subsets from thousands of feature candidates for online services. Such selection enables improved online performance while reducing computational cost. To address feature selection problems in deep learning, trainable gate-based and sensitivity-based methods have been proposed and proven effective in industrial practice. However, through the analysis of real-world cases, we identified three bias issues that cause feature importance estimation to rely on partial model layers, samples, or gradients, ultimately leading to inaccurate importance estimation. We refer to these as layer bias, baseline bias, and approximation bias. To mitigate these issues, we propose FairFS, a fair and accurate feature selection algorithm. FairFS regularizes feature importance estimated across all nonlinear transformation layers to address layer bias. It also introduces a smooth baseline feature close to the classifier decision boundary and adopts an aggregated approximation method to alleviate baseline and approximation biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairFS effectively mitigates these biases and achieves state-of-the-art feature selection performance.'}

Existing approaches typically employ transformer-based architectures to process long sequences of user interactions, capturing preference shifts by modeling temporal relationships between items. However, these methods often overlook the influence of group-level features that capture the collective behavior of similar users. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling temporally evolving group features alongside individual user histories can significantly enhance next-item recommendation. Our approach introduces latent group representations, where each user's affiliation to these groups is modeled through learnable, time-varying membership weights. The membership weights at each timestep are computed by modeling shifts in user preferences through their interaction history, where we incorporate both short-term and long-term user preferences. We extract a set of statistical features that capture the dynamics of user behavior and further refine them through a series of transformations to produce the final drift-aware membership weights. A group-based representation is derived by weighting latent group embeddings with the learned membership scores. This representation is integrated with the user's sequential representation within the transformer block to jointly capture personal and group-level temporal dynamics, producing richer embeddings that lead to more accurate, context-aware recommendations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods."}

However, existing methods often suffer from one or more key limitations: processing different modalities in isolation, requiring complete multimodal data for each interaction during training, or independent learning of user and item representations. These factors contribute to increased complexity and potential misalignment between user and item embeddings. To address these challenges, we propose DReX, a unified multimodal recommendation framework that incrementally refines user and item representations by leveraging interaction-level features from multimodal feedback. Our model employs gated recurrent units to selectively integrate these fine-grained features into global representations. This incremental update mechanism provides three key advantages: (1) simultaneous modeling of both nuanced interaction details and broader preference patterns, (2) eliminates the need for separate user and item feature extraction processes, leading to enhanced alignment in their learned representation, and (3) inherent robustness to varying or missing modalities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on three real-world datasets containing reviews and ratings as interaction modalities. By considering review text as a modality, our approach automatically generates interpretable keyword profiles for both users and items, which supplement the recommendation process with interpretable preference indicators.

To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive multi-agent retrieval framework that dynamically orchestrates specialized agents over multiple reasoning iterations based on the demands of each query. The framework includes: (1) a retrieval agent for scalable retrieval over large video corpora, (2) a reasoning agent for zero-shot contextual temporal reasoning, and (3) a query reformulation agent for refining ambiguous queries and recovering performance for those that degrade over iterations. These agents are dynamically coordinated by an orchestration agent, which leverages intermediate feedback and reasoning outcomes to guide execution.

Guo, Xiuqiang He', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18929', 'abstract': "Conventional sequential recommendation models have achieved remarkable success in mining implicit behavioral patterns. However, these architectures remain structurally blind to explicit user intent: they struggle to adapt when a user's immediate goal (e.g., expressed via a natural language prompt) deviates from their historical habits. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the semantic reasoning to interpret such intent, existing integration paradigms force a dilemma: LLM-as-a-recommender paradigm sacrifices the efficiency and collaborative precision of ID-based retrieval, while Reranking methods are inherently bottlenecked by the recall capabilities of the underlying model. In this paper, we propose Decoupled Promptable Sequential Recommendation (DPR), a model-agnostic framework that empowers conventional sequential backbones to natively support Promptable Recommendation, the ability to dynamically steer the retrieval process using natural language without abandoning collaborative signals. DPR modulates the latent user representation directly within the retrieval space. To achieve this, we introduce a Fusion module to align the collaborative and semantic signals, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that disentangles the conflicting gradients from positive and negative steering, and a three-stage training strategy that progressively aligns the semantic space of prompts with the collaborative space.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{ICPNS (In-Community Popularity Negative Sampling)}, a novel framework that leverages user community structure to identify reliable and informative negative samples. Our approach is grounded in the insight that item exposure is driven by latent user communities. By identifying these communities and utilizing in-community popularity, ICPNS effectively approximates the probability of item exposure. Consequently, items that are popular within a user's community but remain unclicked are identified as more reliable true negatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ICPNS yields consistent improvements on graph-based recommenders and competitive performance on MF-based models, outperforming representative negative sampling strategies under a unified evaluation protocol."}

Moreover, the prevailing single-pass paradigm struggles to deliver optimal answers in long-form generation that requiring multiple citations. To address these limitations, we propose FineRef, a framework based on Fine-grained error Reflection, which explicitly teaches the model to self-identify and correct two key citation errors, mismatch and irrelevance, on a per-citation basis. FineRef follows a two-stage training strategy. The first stage instills an "attempt-reflect-correct" behavioral pattern via supervised fine-tuning, using fine-grained and controllable reflection data constructed by specialized lightweight models. An online self-reflective bootstrapping strategy is designed to improve generalization by iteratively enriching training data with verified, self-improving examples. To further enhance the self-reflection and correction capability, the second stage applies process-level reinforcement learning with a multi-dimensional reward scheme that promotes reflection accuracy, answer quality, and correction gain. Experiments on the ALCE benchmark demonstrate that FineRef significantly improves both citation performance and answer accuracy. Our 7B model outperforms GPT-4 by up to 18% in Citation F1 and 4% in EM Recall, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art model across key evaluation metrics.

By optimizing multi-turn reasoning trajectories under a personalized reward function, the framework reinforces reasoning paths that better align with user-specific preferences and contextual signals reflected by the reward model. Extensive experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark using three LLMs show that PR2 consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving an average relative improvement of 8.8%-12% in personalized QA."}

Koole, Koen Hindriks, Jiahuan Pei', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18962', 'abstract': 'The double empathy problem frames communication difficulties between neurodivergent and neurotypical individuals as arising from mutual misunderstanding, yet most interventions focus on autistic individuals. We present NeuroWise, a multi-agent LLM-based coaching system that supports neurotypical users through stress visualization, interpretation of internal experiences, and contextual guidance. In a between-subjects study (N=30), NeuroWise was rated as helpful by all participants and showed a significant condition-time effect on deficit-based attributions (p=0.02): NeuroWise users reduced deficit framing, while baseline users shifted toward blaming autistic "deficits" after difficult interactions. NeuroWise users also completed conversations more efficiently (37% fewer turns, p=0.03). These findings suggest that AI-based interpretation can support attributional change by helping users recognize communication challenges as mutual.'}

However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.'}

Townsend, Lydia S. Hartwig, Derek Milketinas, Xiao Hu, Carl Yang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18650', 'abstract': 'Personalized nutrition intervention for patients with multimorbidity is critical for improving health outcomes, yet remains challenging because it requires the simultaneous integration of heterogeneous clinical conditions, medications, and dietary guidelines. Single-agent large language models (LLMs) often suffer from context overload and attention dilution when processing such high-dimensional patient profiles. We introduce NutriOrion, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with a parallel-then-sequential reasoning topology. NutriOrion decomposes nutrition planning into specialized domain agents with isolated contexts to mitigate anchoring bias, followed by a conditional refinement stage. The framework includes a multi-objective prioritization algorithm to resolve conflicting dietary requirements and a safety constraint mechanism that injects pharmacological contraindications as hard negative constraints during synthesis, ensuring clinical validity by construction rather than post-hoc filtering. For clinical interoperability, NutriOrion maps synthesized insights into the ADIME standard and FHIR R4 resources. Evaluated on 330 stroke patients with multimorbidity, NutriOrion outperforms multiple baselines, including GPT-4.1 and alternative multi-agent architectures. It achieves a 12.1 percent drug-food interaction violation rate, demonstrates strong personalization with negative correlations (-0.26 to -0.35) between patient biomarkers and recommended risk nutrients, and yields clinically meaningful dietary improvements, including a 167 percent increase in fiber and a 27 percent increase in potassium, alongside reductions in sodium (9 percent) and sugars (12 percent).'}

This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.'}
