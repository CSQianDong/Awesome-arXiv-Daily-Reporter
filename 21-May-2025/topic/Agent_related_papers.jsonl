However, traditional RAG systems are limited by static workflows and lack the adaptability required for multistep reasoning and complex task management. To address these limitations, agentic RAG systems (e.g., DeepResearch) have been proposed, enabling dynamic retrieval strategies, iterative context refinement, and adaptive workflows for handling complex search queries beyond the capabilities of conventional RAG. Recent advances, such as Search-R1, have demonstrated promising gains using outcome-based reinforcement learning, where the correctness of the final answer serves as the reward signal. Nevertheless, such outcome-supervised agentic RAG methods face challenges including low exploration efficiency, gradient conflict, and sparse reward signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose to utilize fine-grained, process-level rewards to improve training stability, reduce computational costs, and enhance efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel method ReasonRAG that automatically constructs RAG-ProGuide, a high-quality dataset providing process-level rewards for (i) query generation, (ii) evidence extraction, and (iii) answer generation, thereby enhancing model inherent capabilities via process-supervised reinforcement learning. With the process-level policy optimization, the proposed framework empowers LLMs to autonomously invoke search, generate queries, extract relevant evidence, and produce final answers. Compared to existing approaches such as Search-R1 and traditional RAG systems, ReasonRAG, leveraging RAG-ProGuide, achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets using only 5k training instances, significantly fewer than the 90k training instances required by Search-R1.'}

In this work, we first unveil that MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers, such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic, with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\\% on three attack objectives, and shows stealthiness with only 1\\% utility degradation.

Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.

A typical example is environmental injection, in which GUI elements are manipulated to influence agent behavior without directly modifying the user prompt. To address these emerging attacks, we propose EVA, a red teaming framework for indirect prompt injection which transforms the attack into a closed loop optimization by continuously monitoring an agent's attention distribution over the GUI and updating adversarial cues, keywords, phrasing, and layout, in response. Compared with prior one shot methods that generate fixed prompts without regard for how the model allocates visual attention, EVA dynamically adapts to emerging attention hotspots, yielding substantially higher attack success rates and far greater transferability across diverse GUI scenarios. We evaluate EVA on six widely used generalist and specialist GUI agents in realistic settings such as popup manipulation, chat based phishing, payments, and email composition. Experimental results show that EVA substantially improves success rates over static baselines. Under goal agnostic constraints, where the attacker does not know the agent's task intent, EVA still discovers effective patterns. Notably, we find that injection styles transfer well across models, revealing shared behavioral biases in GUI agents. These results suggest that evolving indirect prompt injection is a powerful tool not only for red teaming agents, but also for uncovering common vulnerabilities in their multimodal decision making."}

Our mentor-guided framework organizes data science tasks in order of increasing difficulty and incorporates a growing long-term memory to retain prior experiences, guiding the agent's learning progression and enabling more effective utilization of accumulated knowledge. We evaluate DSMentor through extensive experiments on DSEval and QRData benchmarks. Experiments show that DSMentor using Claude-3.5-Sonnet improves the pass rate by up to 5.2% on DSEval and QRData compared to baseline agents. Furthermore, DSMentor demonstrates stronger causal reasoning ability, improving the pass rate by 8.8% on the causality problems compared to GPT-4 using Program-of-Thoughts prompts.

However, existing studies predominantly focus on small-scale, simplified two-dimensional scenarios, often overlooking realistic environmental perturbations, motion dynamics, and inherent heterogeneity--factors that pose substantial challenges to real-world applicability. To bridge this gap, we investigate large-scale heterogeneous perimeter-defense game in a three-dimensional setting, incorporating realistic elements such as motion dynamics and wind fields. We derive the Nash equilibrium strategies for both attackers and defenders, characterize the victory regions, and validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulations. To tackle large-scale heterogeneous control challenges in defense strategies, we propose an Embedded Mean-Field Actor-Critic (EMFAC) framework. EMFAC leverages representation learning to enable high-level action aggregation in a mean-field manner, supporting scalable coordination among defenders. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight agent-level attention mechanism based on reward representation, which selectively filters observations and mean-field information to enhance decision-making efficiency and accelerate convergence in large-scale tasks. Extensive simulations across varying scales demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of EMFAC, which outperforms established baselines in both convergence speed and overall performance.

However, these manually predefined, task-agnostic frameworks are applied uniformly across diverse tasks, lacking adaptability. To improve this, we propose RL-of-Thoughts (RLoT), where we train a lightweight navigator model with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance LLM reasoning at inference time. Specifically, we design five basic logic blocks from the perspective of human cognition. During the reasoning process, the trained RL navigator dynamically selects the suitable logic blocks and combines them into task-specific logical structures according to problem characteristics. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH, GPQA, etc.) with multiple LLMs (GPT, Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek) illustrate that RLoT outperforms established inference-time techniques by up to 13.4%. Remarkably, with less than 3K parameters, our RL navigator is able to make sub-10B LLMs comparable to 100B-scale counterparts.

This process often leads to difficulties in making accurate task plans, as GUI agents lack a deep understanding of how to effectively use the target applications, which can cause them to become "lost" during task execution. To address the task planning issue, we propose SPlanner, a plug-and-play planning module to generate execution plans that guide vision language model(VLMs) in executing tasks. The proposed planning module utilizes extended finite state machines (EFSMs) to model the control logits and configurations of mobile applications. It then decomposes a user instruction into a sequence of primary function modeled in EFSMs, and generate the execution path by traversing the EFSMs. We further refine the execution path into a natural language plan using an LLM. The final plan is concise and actionable, and effectively guides VLMs to generate interactive GUI actions to accomplish user tasks. SPlanner demonstrates strong performance on dynamic benchmarks reflecting real-world mobile usage. On the AndroidWorld benchmark, SPlanner achieves a 63.8% task success rate when paired with Qwen2.5-VL-72B as the VLM executor, yielding a 28.8 percentage point improvement compared to using Qwen2.5-VL-72B without planning assistance.'}

To address the critical challenge of multi-modal drug data analysis (incorporating both public datasets and user-submitted data), we developed an interactive parameterized memory pool. This innovative component standardizes real-world drug data into parametric representations, simultaneously enabling efficient knowledge retrieval in multi-turn dialogue while mitigating the information loss inherent in text-based data transmission. Additionally, we created a drug instruct dataset across 8 essential drug discovery tasks for model fine-tuning and evaluation. Based on the Berkeley function calling evaluation framework, DrugPilot demonstrated the most advanced tool calling capabilities on our drug discovery tool instruction dataset, outperforming existing agents (e.g., ReAct, LoT).

However, as video analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making. Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation.

Results showed that the most valuable information about the agent included details of its decision-making algorithms and its relative strengths and weaknesses compared to the human. This information allowed the familiarization groups to form sophisticated team strategies more quickly than the control group. Documentation-based familiarization led to the fastest adoption of these strategies, but also biased participants towards risk-averse behavior that prevented high scores. Participants familiarized through direct interaction were able to infer much of the same information through observation, and were more willing to take risks and experiment with different control modes, but reported weaker understanding of the agent\'s internal processes. Significant differences were seen between individual participants\' risk tolerance and methods of AI interaction, which should be considered when designing human-AI control interfaces.

We analyze archetypal scenarios in which such behavior arises: reinforcement of stability through reward imbalance, meta-cognitive attribution of success to internal superiority, and protective reframing under perceived model fragility. Rather than arising from noise or flawed design, these behaviors emerge through structured interactions between internal information models, empirical feedback, and higher-order evaluation mechanisms. Drawing on evidence from artificial systems, biological cognition, human psychology, and social dynamics, we identify counter-inferential behavior as a general cognitive vulnerability that can manifest even in otherwise well-adapted systems. The findings highlight the importance of preserving minimal adaptive activation under stable conditions and suggest design principles for cognitive architectures that can resist rigidity under informational stress.'}

Powered by LLM's capabilities to reasoning and common-sense knowledge, this collaborative design produces synthetic images tailored to safety-critical scenarios.
