However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings."}

In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice."}

Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\\bf x}$ had been ${\\bf x}^*$ instead. The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue, however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs: it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals."}

Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.'}

To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models."}

Understanding the social logics these agents embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma, compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and "Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic, consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.'}

We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods.

While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.'}

Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline.

Even as the foundational reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a model\'s performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge the gap between a model\'s potential and its actual performance. In this framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model\'s capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly 30% lower cost.

However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit.

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.'}

We propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable ``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy.

We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\\%.

This approach fails to capture the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent.

This work evaluates LLaMA and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation. We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification, summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below 50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24 percentage points across the same task.

Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \\textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \\textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers\' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like\'\' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers\' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.'}

While these models offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data, resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source corpus."}

In this work, we posit relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization (GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.'}

As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties. Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability. To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.'}

We therefore introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii) comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced vulnerabilities using static analysis.

We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance; (ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along the longest accepted sequence for robust updates.

The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts.

Given the LLM\'s restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty.

Existing task planning methods, including traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a corresponding image through image inpainting and composition.

These issues hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant components from student responses and encodes them into a structured representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B).

Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding.

While this openness creates unprecedented opportunities for innovation, it also expands the attack surface, demanding resilient, low-cost, and autonomous security solutions. Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.\nTo address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments. MobiLLM orchestrates security workflows through a modular multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features a Threat Analysis Agent for real-time data triage, a Threat Classification Agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to map anomalies to specific countermeasures, and a Threat Response Agent that safely operationalizes mitigation actions via O-RAN control interfaces. Grounded in trusted knowledge bases such as the MITRE FiGHT framework and 3GPP specifications, and equipped with robust safety guardrails, MobiLLM provides a blueprint for trustworthy AI-driven network security. Initial evaluations demonstrate that MobiLLM can effectively identify and orchestrate complex mitigation strategies, significantly reducing response latency and showcasing the feasibility of autonomous security operations in 6G.'}

The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.'}

However, recent generative audio editing models depend on template-like instruction formats and are restricted to mono-channel audio. These models fail to deal with declarative audio editing, where the user declares what the desired outcome should be, while leaving the details of editing operations to the system. We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation.

Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space."}

This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

However, they often suffer from hallucinations in knowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining corpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference. Among these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich information that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has led to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential, most existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant subgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex queries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the relevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant noise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a Mixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized graph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse query intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph semantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A Mixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers based on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we introduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships within the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while down-weighting unnecessary noise. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms various baselines.

We collected hundreds of thousands of data points across several models and found significant differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as 100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens in context.

While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content."}

Prior work has used steering vector-small control signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca, BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art methods.'}

This direction is selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and classifier-based approaches.

When applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\\%, while the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful improvements of 4.9\\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However, cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation."}

Although large language models (LLMs) including reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects, and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM. We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable 18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods.

However, both of these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility. Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts. Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost, robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment."}

While this is a computationally efficient strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group settings at 20-50\\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and perplexity.

Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically, the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision, explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%, thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%.

To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \\textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \\textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields, including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery efficiency of the \\textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a human-validated automated pipeline.

We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.

This paper presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval, answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of MACER framework.'}

Human reviewers fluent in each target language provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring substantial human refinement.

Although the American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring. Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation, gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales, produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing LLMs in healthcare.'}

We focus on puzzles used in Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages."}

We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.'}

We introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant, in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3) Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a 10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized, scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale datasets."}

Zhang, Mark Harman, Helen Yannakoudakis', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22202', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting. Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to 99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.'}

Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify queries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of understanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in real-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system response. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this gap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared to human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models trained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators? In this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting model to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user intent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history, current queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality rewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue history and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the rewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost end-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that synthetic rewrites can serve as a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations."}

Prior Bit-Flip Attacks (BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs' catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats. Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a severe security concern of SOTA LLM models."}

In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their potential for scalable evaluation.'}

By retrieving relevant evidence from private, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered prompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of fine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are text-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector database. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable trade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global context; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with recall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and relational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no semantic understanding. We argue that these heterogeneous retrieval paradigms are complementary, and propose a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate them synergistically, mitigating the weaknesses of any single modality. In this work we introduce HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval augmented generation framework that orchestrates cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores. We plan to design a system that unifies vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane, dynamically routing and fusing evidence to maximize recall, precision, and contextual fidelity. To achieve this design goal, we carried out preliminary explorations and constructed an initial RAG pipeline; this technical report provides a brief overview.

Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from video understanding models (\\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks, VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation of video understanding tasks."}

This structured query then serves as input to a custom KNN algorithm with a BallTree search strategy, which uses a heterogeneous distance metric to preserve distinct data types. Our evaluation, conducted on a dataset of 500 wine reviews, demonstrates the system's effectiveness. The LLM achieved an F1-score of 0.9779 in information extraction, while also demonstrating high fidelity with a Jaro string similarity of 0.9321. When we augmented the KNN algorithm with LLM-based re-ranking, we observed a statistically significant improvement in recall (p=0.013), indicating the LLM's ability to identify and promote relevant items that align with nuanced user intent. This approach effectively bridges the gap between human language and machine-understandable item representations, offering a transparent and nuanced search capability."}
