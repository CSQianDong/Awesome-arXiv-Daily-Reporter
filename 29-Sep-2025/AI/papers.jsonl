In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice."}

However, existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search (DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.'}

While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.'}

Understanding the social logics these agents embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma, compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and "Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic, consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.'}

To provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations, thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of black-box models."}

In this work, we propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities. Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings."}

We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop.

To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods.

Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\\bf x}$ had been ${\\bf x}^*$ instead. The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue, however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs: it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals."}

While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N \\times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of variable-length English sentences.

Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model\'s capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly 30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.'}

Model merging has emerged as a promising, training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model. While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves, providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape. Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces. Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning profiles to meet diverse application demands.'}

However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent, where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems, but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5 only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models. Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic reasoning."}

We show that this is not an inherent failure but an artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying representational geometry of the knowledge being modified."}

Due to their strong planning and reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems."}

Data from multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform decision-making.'}

State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS (DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS. DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals. Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains under disturbances.'}

To resolve this, we introduce \\textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective. First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce \\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model is trained to predict only the \\textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs.

To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g., inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses, enabling efficient and precise reward service.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR, a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and DA-Code.

However, existing studies are primarily based on one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed. LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way. To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue, maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability."}

This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and, therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage, latency, and memory overhead.

Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix, which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable across tasks and modalities.'}

Existing large language model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks: spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification (geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error (RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\\%. Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable, high-quality evolution.

The electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks."}

We present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\\% (2) Score filtering was found to reduce AUROC by 15\\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their performance by upto 40\\%, even when re-trained."}

Here we show that the equations used to describe neuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of activity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from non-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn best when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks.'}

Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).

Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.

In this paper, we propose WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent.

More recently, it has also been adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542 expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative, cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot, few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect). Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic expressions.

By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\\beta+1)/(\\beta+2)}$, where $\\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift.

Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.

Recent deep learning approaches often disregard admissibility and provide limited guarantees on generalization beyond the training data. This paper addresses both of these limitations. First, we pose heuristic learning as a constrained optimization problem and introduce Cross-Entropy Admissibility (CEA), a loss function that enforces admissibility during training. On the Rubik's Cube domain, this method yields near-admissible heuristics with significantly stronger guidance than compressed pattern database (PDB) heuristics. Theoretically, we study the sample complexity of learning heuristics. By leveraging PDB abstractions and the structural properties of graphs such as the Rubik's Cube, we tighten the bound on the number of training samples needed for A-star to generalize. Replacing a general hypothesis class with a ReLU neural network gives bounds that depend primarily on the network's width and depth, rather than on graph size. Using the same network, we also provide the first generalization guarantees for goal-dependent heuristics."}

While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii) patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about 97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission efficient for edge cloud learning.'}

We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023.

Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.'}

We train a generative model $g:\\mathcal{Z}\\to\\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\\mathcal{Z}$."}

We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.'}

This task, known as machine unlearning, aims to remove the influence of targeted data (forgetting) while maintaining performance on the remaining data (retention). A common approach is to formulate this as a multi-objective problem and reduce it to a single-objective problem via scalarization, where forgetting and retention losses are combined using a weighted sum. However, this often results in unstable training dynamics and degraded model utility due to conflicting gradient directions. To address these challenges, we propose OFMU, a penalty-based bi-level optimization framework that explicitly prioritizes forgetting while preserving retention through a hierarchical structure. Our method enforces forgetting via an inner maximization step that incorporates a similarity-aware penalty to decorrelate the gradients of the forget and retention objectives, and restores utility through an outer minimization step. To ensure scalability, we develop a two-loop algorithm with provable convergence guarantees under both convex and non-convex regimes. We further provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of convergence rates and show that our approach achieves better trade-offs between forgetting efficacy and model utility compared to prior methods. Extensive experiments across vision and language benchmarks demonstrate that OFMU consistently outperforms existing unlearning methods in both forgetting efficacy and retained utility.'}

In addition, while English generally yields more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a language and its syntactic similarity to English.

Our empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization, highlighting key optimization challenges.

To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering: (1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact, knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts contribute significantly.

This requires integrating both hardware components (e.g. sensors, actuators) and software systems capable of reasoning about tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Frameworks such as the Robot Operating System (ROS) provide open-source tools that help connect low-level hardware with higher-level functionalities. However, real-world deployments remain tightly coupled to specific platforms. As a result, solutions are often isolated and hard-coded, limiting interoperability, reusability, and knowledge sharing. Ontologies and knowledge graphs offer a structured way to represent tasks, environments, and robot capabilities. Existing ontologies, such as the Socio-physical Model of Activities (SOMA) and the Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering (DOLCE), provide models for activities, spatial relationships, and reasoning structures. However, they often focus on specific domains and do not fully capture the connection between environment, action, robot capabilities, and system-level integration. In this work, we propose the Ontology for roBOts and acTions (OntoBOT), which extends existing ontologies to provide a unified representation of tasks, actions, environments, and capabilities. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we unify these aspects into a cohesive ontology to support formal reasoning about task execution, and (2) we demonstrate its generalizability by evaluating competency questions across four embodied agents - TIAGo, HSR, UR3, and Stretch - showing how OntoBOT enables context-aware reasoning, task-oriented execution, and knowledge sharing in service robotics.'}

Existing methods reduce communication by performing multiple local updates between infrequent global synchronizations. We demonstrate that their efficiency can be significantly improved by restricting backpropagation: instead of updating all the parameters, each node updates only a fixed subset while keeping the remainder frozen during local steps. This constraint substantially reduces peak memory usage and training FLOPs, while a full forward pass over all parameters eliminates the need for cross-node activation exchange. Experiments on a $1.3$B-parameter language model trained across $32$ nodes show that our method matches the perplexity of prior low-communication approaches under identical token and bandwidth budgets while reducing training FLOPs and peak memory.'}

Existing interpretability research has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality, attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch, we introduce \\textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For the textual branch, we propose \\textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC), which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained explanations of model behavior.'}

A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly, its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated clinical workflows.'}

The Anatomical Feature-Prioritized (AFP) loss was introduced, which compares multilayer features extracted from a compact segmentation network trained on TotalSegmentator labels, enhancing reconstruction of clinically relevant structures. Input volumes were normalized per-case using zscore normalization for MRIs, and clipping plus dataset level zscore normalization for CBCT and CT. Training used 3D patches tailored to each anatomical region without additional data augmentation. Models were trained for 1000 and 1500 epochs, with AFP fine-tuning performed for 500 epochs using a combined L1+AFP objective. During inference, overlapping patches were aggregated via mean averaging with step size of 0.3, and postprocessing included reverse zscore normalization. Both network configurations were applied across all regions, allowing consistent model design while capturing local adaptations through residual learning and AFP loss. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation revealed that residual networks combined with AFP yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, particularly for bone structures in MR to CT and lesions in CBCT to CT, while L1only networks achieved slightly better intensity-based metrics.

Furthermore, in games with three or more players, following Nash equilibrium no longer guarantees a non-losing outcome. These limitations, along with others, significantly restrict the applicability of CFR to the most popular formats: tournaments. Motivated by the recent success of Large Language Models (LLM) in chess and Diplomacy, we present SpinGPT, the first LLM tailored to Spin & Go, a popular three-player online poker format. SpinGPT is trained in two stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning on 320k high-stakes expert decisions; (2) Reinforcement Learning on 270k solver-generated hands. Our results show that SpinGPT matches the solver's actions in 78% of decisions (tolerant accuracy). With a simple deep-stack heuristic, it achieves 13.4 +/- 12.9 BB/100 versus Slumbot in heads-up over 30,000 hands (95% CI).

Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities.

From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency."}

To support analysis and training for the latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation. With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization of sentiment across various time-periods.

Despite this success, these models face a key challenge: predicting future climates while being trained only with historical data. In this study, we investigate this issue by analyzing boreal winter land temperature biases in AI weather and climate models. We examine two weather models, FourCastNet V2 Small (FourCastNet) and Pangu Weather (Pangu), evaluating their predictions for 2020-2025 and Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2 (ACE2) for 1996-2010. These time periods lie outside of the respective models' training sets and are significantly more recent than the bulk of their training data, allowing us to assess how well the models generalize to new, i.e. more modern, conditions. We find that all three models produce cold-biased mean temperatures, resembling climates from 15-20 years earlier than the period they are predicting. In some regions, like the Eastern U.S., the predictions resemble climates from as much as 20-30 years earlier. Further analysis shows that FourCastNet's and Pangu's cold bias is strongest in the hottest predicted temperatures, indicating limited training exposure to modern extreme heat events. In contrast, ACE2's bias is more evenly distributed but largest in regions, seasons, and parts of the temperature distribution where climate change has been most pronounced. These findings underscore the challenge of training AI models exclusively on historical data and highlight the need to account for such biases when applying them to future climate prediction."}

We leverage this strategy in two ways:\n(1) We use stochastic activations during pre-training and fine-tune the model with RELU, which is used at inference time to provide sparse latent vectors.

Unlike standard tabular data, survival data often come with incomplete event information due to dropout, or loss to follow-up.

In this paper, we propose SurvDiff, an end-to-end diffusion model specifically designed for generating synthetic data in survival analysis. SurvDiff is tailored to capture the data-generating mechanism by jointly generating mixed-type covariates, event times, and right-censoring, guided by a survival-tailored loss function. The loss encodes the time-to-event structure and directly optimizes for downstream survival tasks, which ensures that SurvDiff (i) reproduces realistic event-time distributions and (ii) preserves the censoring mechanism. Across multiple datasets, we show that \\survdiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generative baselines in both distributional fidelity and downstream evaluation metrics across multiple medical datasets.

Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g., knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input prompt. However, transformers\' capability to infer transitive relations from training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like\'\' directed graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of transformers\' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components, transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the number of components is large.'}

To address this trade-off, we propose Progressive Weight Loading (PWL), a novel technique that enables fast initial inference by first deploying a lightweight student model, then incrementally replacing its layers with those of a pre-trained teacher model. To support seamless layer substitution, we introduce a training method that not only aligns intermediate feature representations between student and teacher layers, but also improves the overall output performance of the student model. Our experiments on VGG, ResNet, and ViT architectures demonstrate that models trained with PWL maintain competitive distillation performance and gradually improve accuracy as teacher layers are loaded-matching the final accuracy of the full teacher model without compromising initial inference speed. This makes PWL particularly suited for dynamic, resource-constrained deployments where both responsiveness and performance are critical.'}

In this work, we introduce HEAPr, a novel pruning algorithm that decomposes experts into smaller, indivisible atomic experts, enabling more precise and flexible atomic expert pruning. To measure the importance of each atomic expert, we leverage second-order information based on principles similar to Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) theory. To address the computational and storage challenges posed by second-order information, HEAPr exploits the inherent properties of atomic experts to transform the second-order information from expert parameters into that of atomic expert parameters, and further simplifies it to the second-order information of atomic expert outputs. This approach reduces the space complexity from $O(d^4)$, where d is the model's dimensionality, to $O(d^2)$. HEAPr requires only two forward passes and one backward pass on a small calibration set to compute the importance of atomic experts. Extensive experiments on MoE models, including DeepSeek MoE and Qwen MoE family, demonstrate that HEAPr outperforms existing expert-level pruning methods across a wide range of compression ratios and benchmarks.

While recent studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models. Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly outperforming the existing baseline.

At the same time, their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.'}

Based on the principle of implicit learning, speech-language therapists (SLTs) typically embed target morphological structures (e.g., third person -s) into everyday interactions or game-based learning activities. Educators are recommended by SLTs to do the same. This approach demands precise linguistic knowledge and real-time production of various morphological forms (e.g., "Daddy wears these when he drives to work"). The task becomes even more demanding when educators or parent also must keep children engaged and manage turn-taking in a game-based activity. In the TalBot project our multiprofessional team have developed an application in which the Furhat conversational robot plays the word retrieval game "Alias" with children to improve language skills. Our application currently employs a large language model (LLM) to manage gameplay, dialogue, affective responses, and turn-taking. Our next step is to further leverage the capacity of LLMs so the robot can generate and deliver specific morphological targets during the game. We hypothesize that a robot could outperform humans at this task. Novel aspects of this approach are that the robot could ultimately serve as a model and tutor for both children and professionals and that using LLM capabilities in this context would support basic communication needs for children with language vulnerabilities. Our long-term goal is to create a robust LLM-based Robot-Assisted Language Learning intervention capable of teaching a variety of morphological structures across different languages.'}

To address these challenges, we propose CSAgent, a system-level, static policy-based access control framework for computer-use agents. To bridge the gap between static policy and dynamic context and user intent, CSAgent introduces intent- and context-aware policies, and provides an automated toolchain to assist developers in constructing and refining them. CSAgent enforces these policies through an optimized OS service, ensuring that agent actions can only be executed under specific user intents and contexts.

Therefore, we require algorithms that can make suitable and transparent trade-offs between performance and the desired fairness notions.

Insights provided by the reinforcement learning algorithm regarding the obtainable performance-fairness trade-offs can then guide stakeholders in selecting the most appropriate policy. To capture fairness, we propose an extended Markov decision process, $f$MDP, that explicitly encodes individuals and groups. Given this $f$MDP, we formalise fairness notions in the context of sequential decision problems and formulate a fairness framework that computes fairness measures over time. We evaluate our framework in two scenarios with distinct fairness requirements: job hiring, where strong teams must be composed while treating applicants equally, and fraud detection, where fraudulent transactions must be detected while ensuring the burden on customers is fairly distributed. We show that our framework learns policies that are more fair across multiple scenarios, with only minor loss in performance reward. Moreover, we observe that group and individual fairness notions do not necessarily imply one another, highlighting the benefit of our framework in settings where both fairness types are desired.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously addressing their monosemous limitations."}

Then, we convert one-third of the population into AVs, which are RL agents employing Deep Q-learning algorithm. We define a set of optimization targets, or as we call them behaviors, namely selfish, collaborative, competitive, social, altruistic, and malicious. We impose a selected behavior on AVs through their rewards. We run our simulations using our in-house developed RL framework PARCOUR. Our simulations reveal that AVs optimize their travel times by up to 5\\%, with varying impacts on human drivers' travel times depending on the AV behavior. In all cases where AVs adopt a self-serving behavior, they achieve shorter travel times than human drivers.

Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks, particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels. RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve as structured, controllable prompts for generative models.

While particle-based simulators can efficiently reproduce forward dynamics, inverse inference remains difficult, especially in dissipative systems where dynamics are irreversible and optimization-based solvers are slow, unstable, and often fail to converge. In this work, we introduce the Reversible Graph Network Simulator (R-GNS), a unified framework that enforces bidirectional consistency within a single graph architecture. Unlike prior neural simulators that approximate inverse dynamics by fitting backward data, R-GNS does not attempt to reverse the underlying physics. Instead, we propose a mathematically invertible design based on residual reversible message passing with shared parameters, coupling forward dynamics with inverse inference to deliver accurate predictions and efficient recovery of plausible initial states. Experiments on three dissipative benchmarks (Water-3D, WaterRamps, and WaterDrop) show that R-GNS achieves higher accuracy and consistency with only one quarter of the parameters, and performs inverse inference more than 100 times faster than optimization-based baselines. For forward simulation, R-GNS matches the speed of strong GNS baselines, while in goal-conditioned tasks it eliminates iterative optimization and achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups. On goal-conditioned tasks, R-GNS further demonstrates its ability to complex target shapes (e.g., characters "L" and "N") through vivid, physically consistent trajectories. To our knowledge, this is the first reversible framework that unifies forward and inverse simulation for dissipative fluid systems.'}

By utilizing the corresponding unique symmetric matrix and its inherent diagonal form, we incorporate suitable inductive biases into the neural network architecture, leading to models that are both simplified and efficient.

While semi-structured (N:M) pruning is well-established for weights, its application to activation pruning remains underexplored despite its potential for dynamic, input-adaptive compression and reductions in I/O overhead. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of methods for post-training N:M activation pruning in LLMs. Across multiple LLMs, we demonstrate that pruning activations enables superior preservation of generative capabilities compared to weight pruning at equivalent sparsity levels. We evaluate lightweight, plug-and-play error mitigation techniques and pruning criteria, establishing strong hardware-friendly baselines that require minimal calibration. Furthermore, we explore sparsity patterns beyond NVIDIA's standard 2:4, showing that the 16:32 pattern achieves performance nearly on par with unstructured sparsity. However, considering the trade-off between flexibility and hardware implementation complexity, we focus on the 8:16 pattern as a superior candidate. Our findings provide both effective practical methods for activation pruning and a motivation for future hardware to support more flexible sparsity patterns. Our code is available this https URL ."}

Despite its effectiveness, vector quantization poses a fundamental challenge: the non-differentiable quantization step blocks gradient backpropagation. Smoothed vector quantization addresses this issue by relaxing the hard assignment of a codebook vector into a weighted combination of codebook entries, represented as the matrix product of a simplex vector and the codebook. Effective smoothing requires two properties: (1) smoothed quantizers should remain close to a onehot vector, ensuring tight approximation, and (2) all codebook entries should be utilized, preventing code collapse. Existing methods typically address these desiderata separately. By contrast, the present study introduces a simple and intuitive regularization that promotes both simultaneously by minimizing the distance between each simplex vertex and its $K$-nearest smoothed quantizers. Experiments on representative benchmarks, including discrete image autoencoding and contrastive speech representation learning, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more reliable codebook utilization and improves performance compared to prior approaches.'}

Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance; (ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and speedup.

The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of uninformative shortcuts.

Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs), such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to their inherent limitations.

This in turn hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be mapped to, and grounded in.

The Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based methods have become the core technique in LiDAR odometry due to their efficient and accurate point cloud registration capability. However, some existing ICP-based methods do not consider the reliability of the initial pose, which may cause the method to converge to a local optimum. Furthermore, the absence of an adaptive mechanism hinders the effective handling of complex dynamic environments, resulting in a significant degradation of registration accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes an adaptive ICP-based LiDAR odometry method that relies on a reliable initial pose. First, distributed coarse registration based on density filtering is employed to obtain the initial pose estimation. The reliable initial pose is then selected by comparing it with the motion prediction pose, reducing the initial error between the source and target point clouds. Subsequently, by combining the current and historical errors, the adaptive threshold is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the real-time changes in the dynamic environment. Finally, based on the reliable initial pose and the adaptive threshold, point-to-plane adaptive ICP registration is performed from the current frame to the local map, achieving high-precision alignment of the source and target point clouds. Extensive experiments on the public KITTI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and significantly enhances the accuracy of LiDAR odometry.'}

However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end, we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with greater efficiency.

Unlike the costly, expert-driven manual teleoperation commonly used in training Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), egocentric videos offer a scalable alternative. However, prior studies that leverage such videos for training robot policies typically rely on auxiliary annotations, such as detailed hand-pose recordings. Consequently, it remains unclear whether VLAs can be trained directly from raw egocentric videos. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging EgoScaler, a framework that extracts 6DoF object manipulation trajectories from egocentric videos without requiring auxiliary recordings. We apply EgoScaler to four large-scale egocentric video datasets and automatically refine noisy or incomplete trajectories, thereby constructing a new large-scale dataset for VLA pre-training. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art $\\pi_0$ architecture in both simulated and real-robot environments yield three key findings: (i) pre-training on our dataset improves task success rates by over 20\\% compared to training from scratch, (ii) the performance is competitive with that achieved using real-robot datasets, and (iii) combining our dataset with real-robot data yields further improvements.

To remedy this, we propose to augment continuous trajectory generation by simultaneously generating a high-level symbolic plan. We show that this requires a novel mix of discrete variable diffusion and continuous diffusion, which dramatically outperforms the baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this hybrid diffusion process enables flexible trajectory synthesis, allowing us to condition synthesized actions on partial and complete symbolic conditions.'}

Guided by four research questions, we examine: (i) which applications of LLMs in education have been most frequently explored; (ii) how researchers have measured their impact; (iii) which risks stem from such applications; and (iv) what mitigation strategies have been proposed. We find that research on LLMs clusters around three domains: operational effectiveness, personalized applications, and interactive learning tools. Across these, model-level risks include superficial understanding, bias, limited robustness, anthropomorphism, hallucinations, privacy concerns, and knowledge constraints. When learners interact with LLMs, these risks extend to cognitive and behavioural outcomes, including reduced neural activity, over-reliance, diminished independent learning skills, and a loss of student agency.

Rather than relying on manual prompt engineering, attacker LLMs can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate such prompts using only a toxicity classifier as a reward. However, capturing a wide range of harmful behaviors is a significant challenge that requires explicit diversity objectives. Existing diversity-seeking RL methods often collapse to limited modes: once high-reward prompts are found, exploration of new regions is discouraged. Inspired by the active learning paradigm that encourages adaptive exploration, we introduce \\textit{Active Attacks}, a novel RL-based red-teaming algorithm that adapts its attacks as the victim evolves. By periodically safety fine-tuning the victim LLM with collected attack prompts, rewards in exploited regions diminish, which forces the attacker to seek unexplored vulnerabilities. This process naturally induces an easy-to-hard exploration curriculum, where the attacker progresses beyond easy modes toward increasingly difficult ones. As a result, Active Attacks uncovers a wide range of local attack modes step by step, and their combination achieves wide coverage of the multi-mode distribution. Active Attacks, a simple plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into existing RL objectives, unexpectedly outperformed prior RL-based methods -- including GFlowNets, PPO, and REINFORCE -- by improving cross-attack success rates against GFlowNets, the previous state-of-the-art, from 0.07% to 31.28% (a relative gain greater than $400\\ \\times$) with only a 6% increase in computation.

This paper provides the very first systematic exploration and discussion, together with a resolution proposal, to disclose the many faces of surrogate models for configuration tuning, through the novel perspective of fitness landscape analysis. We present a theory as an alternative to accuracy for assessing the model usefulness in tuning, based on which we conduct an extensive empirical study involving up to 27,000 cases. Drawing on the above, we propose Model4Tune, an automated predictive tool that estimates which model-tuner pairs are the best for an unforeseen system without expensive tuner profiling. Our results suggest that Moldel4Tune, as one of the first of its kind, performs significantly better than random guessing in 79%-82% of the cases.

However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions. In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition (e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines.

However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding.

Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks.

These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance on distinct long-horizon tasks.'}

Beyond the idealized setting, we consider model estimation errors and introduce formal definitions of underfitting and overfitting specific to generative models.

It provides real time visualization at low cost and dose. However, photon scattering and beam hindrance cause artifacts in CBCT. These include inaccurate Hounsfield Units (HU), reducing reliability for dose calculation, and adaptive planning. By contrast, computed tomography (CT) offers better image quality and accurate HU calibration but is usually acquired offline and fails to capture intra-treatment anatomical changes. Thus, accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis is needed to close the imaging-quality gap in adaptive radiotherapy workflows.\nTo cater to this, we propose a novel diffusion-based conditional generative model, coined EqDiff-CT, to synthesize high-quality CT images from CBCT. EqDiff-CT employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to iteratively inject noise and learn latent representations that enable reconstruction of anatomically consistent CT images. A group-equivariant conditional U-Net backbone, implemented with e2cnn steerable layers, enforces rotational equivariance (cyclic C4 symmetry), helping preserve fine structural details while minimizing noise and artifacts.\nThe system was trained and validated on the SynthRAD2025 dataset, comprising CBCT-CT scans across multiple head-and-neck anatomical sites, and we compared it with advanced methods such as CycleGAN and DDPM. EqDiff-CT provided substantial gains in structural fidelity, HU accuracy and quantitative metrics. Visual findings further confirm the improved recovery, sharper soft tissue boundaries, and realistic bone reconstructions. The findings suggest that the diffusion model has offered a robust and generalizable framework for CBCT improvements.

These issues hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent REcognition.

This design ensures that model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics, AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK, correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated scoring.'}

In this work, we develop a general framework to analyze such sketched bilinear forms and derive uniform bounds in terms of geometric complexities of the associated sets.

We further extend these results to the setting where the bilinear form involves a sum of $T$ independent sketching matrices and show that the deviation scales as $\\sqrt{T}$. This unified analysis recovers known results such as the J-L lemma as special cases, while extending RIP-type guarantees. Additionally, we obtain improved convergence bounds for sketched Federated Learning algorithms where such cross terms arise naturally due to sketched gradient compression, and design sketched variants of bandit algorithms with sharper regret bounds that depend on the geometric complexity of the action and parameter sets, rather than the ambient dimension.'}

A 20 problem benchmark suite is designed drawing from undergraduate level physics kinematics problems. In each problem, the LLM is provided with a natural language description of the objects' motion and must produce a model in differential game logic (dGL). The model is (1) syntax checked and iteratively refined based on parser feedback, and (2) semantically evaluated by checking whether symbolically executing the dGL formula recovers the solution to the original physics problem. A success rate of 70% (best over 5 samples) is achieved. We analyze failing cases, identifying directions for future improvement.

Trajectory control represents a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation.

To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled 3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding, STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.

The inherent sensitivity of these systems to initial conditions, coupled with a scarcity of observational data, severely constrains traditional modeling approaches. Since these models are typically trained for a specific system, they lack the generalization capacity necessary for real-world applications, which demand robust zero-shot or few-shot forecasting on novel or data-limited scenarios. To overcome this generalization barrier, we propose ChaosNexus, a foundation model pre-trained on a diverse corpus of chaotic dynamics. ChaosNexus employs a novel multi-scale architecture named ScaleFormer augmented with Mixture-of-Experts layers, to capture both universal patterns and system-specific behaviors. The model demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. On a large-scale testbed comprising over 9,000 synthetic chaotic systems, it improves the fidelity of long-term attractor statistics by more than 40% compared to the leading baseline. This robust performance extends to real-world applications with exceptional data efficiency. For instance, in 5-day global weather forecasting, ChaosNexus achieves a competitive zero-shot mean error below 1 degree, a result that further improves with few-shot fine-tuning. Moreover, experiments on the scaling behavior of ChaosNexus provide a guiding principle for scientific foundation models: cross-system generalization stems from the diversity of training systems, rather than sheer data volume.'}

Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual cultural alignment tasks.

Although speculative decoding presents a promising direction for acceleration, its direct application in GRPO achieves limited speedup under high-concurrency training conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a concurrency-aware speculative decoding framework that dynamically adjusts the drafting and verification strategy according to real-time concurrency levels, thereby maximizing the acceleration of the generation process.

It is, however, evident that this step can cause significant bias in data and amplify unfairness in downstream tasks.\nIn this paper, we address this issue by introducing the unbiased binning problem that, given an attribute to bucketize, finds its closest discretization to equal-size binning that satisfies group parity across different buckets. Defining a small set of boundary candidates, we prove that unbiased binning must select its boundaries from this set. We then develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm on top of the boundary candidates to solve the unbiased binning problem.\nFinding an unbiased binning may sometimes result in a high price of fairness, or it may not even exist, especially when group values follow different distributions. Considering that a small bias in the group ratios may be tolerable in such settings, we introduce the epsilon-biased binning problem that bounds the group disparities across buckets to a small value epsilon. We first develop a dynamic programming solution, DP, that finds the optimal binning in quadratic time. The DP algorithm, while polynomial, does not scale to very large settings. Therefore, we propose a practically scalable algorithm, based on local search (LS), for epsilon-biased binning. The key component of the LS algorithm is a divide-and-conquer (D&C) algorithm that finds a near-optimal solution for the problem in near-linear time. We prove that D&C finds a valid solution for the problem unless none exists. The LS algorithm then initiates a local search, using the D&C solution as the upper bound, to find the optimal solution.'}

Specifically, BrainPoG first contains a filter to extract the pathological pattern formulated by highly disease-relevant subgraphs, achieving graph pruning and lesion localization. A PathoGraph is therefore constructed by dropping less disease-relevant subgraphs from the whole brain graph. Afterwards, a pathological feature distillation module is designed to reduce disease-irrelevant noise features and enhance pathological features of each node in the PathoGraph. BrainPoG can exclusively learn informative disease-related knowledge while avoiding less relevant information, achieving efficient brain graph learning.

We propose using the most recent output as a draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end condition is met.\nUnlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.

SlotFM uses Time-Frequency Slot Attention, an extension of Slot Attention that processes both time and frequency representations of the raw signals. It generates multiple small embeddings (slots), each capturing different signal components, enabling task-specific heads to focus on the most relevant parts of the data. We also introduce two loss regularizers that capture local structure and frequency patterns, which improve reconstruction of fine-grained details and helps the embeddings preserve task-relevant information. We evaluate SlotFM on 16 classification and regression downstream tasks that extend beyond standard human activity recognition. It outperforms existing self-supervised approaches on 13 of these tasks and achieves comparable results to the best performing approaches on the remaining tasks.

To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a new regularization method, i.e., Enforcing Domain-Informed Monotonicity in Deep Neural Networks (DIM), which maintains domain-informed monotonic relationships in complex deep learning models to further improve predictions. Specifically, our method enforces monotonicity by penalizing violations relative to a linear baseline, effectively encouraging the model to follow expected trends while preserving its predictive power. We formalize this approach through a comprehensive mathematical framework that establishes a linear reference, measures deviations from monotonic behavior, and integrates these measurements into the training objective. We test and validate the proposed methodology using a real-world ridesourcing dataset from Chicago and a synthetically created dataset. Experiments across various neural network architectures show that even modest monotonicity constraints consistently enhance model performance. DIM enhances the predictive performance of deep neural networks by applying domain-informed monotonicity constraints to regularize model behavior and mitigate overfitting'}

LoH extends propositional logic syntax with a choice operator, which has learnable parameters and selects a subformula from a pool of options.

Our core finding is that -- for our formal definitions of these notions -- a safe and trusted AI system cannot be an AGI system: for such a safe, trusted system there are task instances which are easily and provably solvable by a human but not by the system.

Legacy defenses remain largely reactive, labor-intensive, and inadequate for the scale and complexity of next-generation systems. Current O-RAN applications focus mainly on network optimization or passive threat detection, with limited capability for closed-loop, automated response.\nTo address this critical gap, we present an agentic AI framework for fully automated, end-to-end threat mitigation in 6G O-RAN environments.

We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and produces robust composite signatures.

We introduce SmartDJ, a novel framework for stereo audio editing that combines the reasoning capability of audio language models with the generative power of latent diffusion. Given a high-level instruction, SmartDJ decomposes it into a sequence of atomic edit operations, such as adding, removing, or spatially relocating events. These operations are then executed by a diffusion model trained to manipulate stereo audio. To support this, we design a data synthesis pipeline that produces paired examples of high-level instructions, atomic edit operations, and audios before and after each edit operation.

This bottleneck is substantial; for instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of 4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular, OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning."}

Apolinario, Kaushik Roy', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21617', 'abstract': 'On-device learning is essential for personalization, privacy, and long-term adaptation in resource-constrained environments. Achieving this requires efficient learning, both fine-tuning existing models and continually acquiring new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Yet both settings are constrained by high memory cost of storing activations during backpropagation. Existing activation compression methods reduce this cost but relying on repeated low-rank decompositions, introducing computational overhead. Also, such methods have not been explored for continual learning. We propose LANCE (Low-rank Activation Compression), a framework that performs one-shot higher-order Singular Value Decompsoition (SVD) to obtain a reusable low-rank subspace for activation projection. This eliminates repeated decompositions, reducing both memory and computation. Moreover, fixed low-rank subspaces further enable on-device continual learning by allocating tasks to orthogonal subspaces without storing large task-specific matrices. Experiments show that LANCE reduces activation storage up to 250$\\times$ while maintaining accuracy comparable to full backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100, Oxford-IIIT Pets, Flowers102, and CUB-200 datasets. On continual learning benchmarks (Split CIFAR-100, Split MiniImageNet, 5-Datasets), it achieves performance competitive with orthogonal gradient projection methods at a fraction of the memory cost. These results position LANCE as a practical and scalable solution for efficient fine-tuning and continual learning on edge devices.'}

Our analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs 0.288).

We extensively evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on real-world intuitive physics datasets.

While contrastive learning methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly at finer granularity.'}

A total of 162 eligible studies (146 contributed to the meta-analysis; 468 effect sizes) were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which integrated frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Our results indicate that individuals exhibited less prosocial behaviour and moral engagement when interacting with agents vs. humans. They attributed less agency and responsibility to agents, perceiving them as less competent, likeable, and socially present. In contrast, individuals' social alignment (i.e., alignment or adaptation of internal states and behaviours with partners), trust in partners, personal agency, task performance, and interaction experiences were generally comparable when interacting with agents vs. humans. We observed high effect-size heterogeneity for many subjective responses (i.e., social perceptions of partners, subjective trust, and interaction experiences), suggesting context-dependency of partner effects. By examining the characteristics of studies, participants, partners, interaction scenarios, and response measures, we also identified several moderators shaping partner effects. Overall, functional behaviours and interactive experiences with agents can resemble those with humans, whereas fundamental social attributions and moral/prosocial concerns lag in human-agent interactions. Agents are thus afforded instrumental value on par with humans but lack comparable intrinsic value, providing practical implications for agent design and regulation."}

The dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) -- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment, BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together, these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.'}

We propose a novel framework, named $\\mathbf{Li_2}$, that captures three key stages for the grokking behavior of 2-layer nonlinear networks: (I) Lazy learning, (II) independent feature learning and (III) interactive feature learning, characterized by the structure of backpropagated gradient $G_F$ across layers. In (I), $G_F$ is random, and top layer overfits to random hidden representation. In (II), the gradient of each node (column of $G_F$) only depends on its own activation, and thus each hidden node learns their representation independently from $G_F$, which now carries information about target labels, thanks to weight decay. Interestingly, the independent dynamics follows exactly the gradient ascent of an energy function $E$, and its local maxima are precisely the emerging features. We study whether these local-optima induced features are generalizable, their representation power, and how they change on sample size, in group arithmetic tasks. Finally, in (III), we provably show how hidden nodes interact, and how $G_F$ changes to focus on missing features that need to be learned.

Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals.

This motivate us to focus on the high-reward region. However, such tail examples are scarce under the base LLM. While off-policy exemplars (e.g. from stronger models or rewrites) are easier to obtain, naively training on them yields a misspecified reward for the policy we aim to align. To address this, we study rubric-based rewards. By design, rubrics can leverage off-policy examples while remaining insensitive to their artifacts. To elicit rubrics that capture the high-reward tail, we highlight the importance of distinguishing among great and diverse responses, and introduce a workflow to implement this idea. We empirically demonstrate that rubric-based rewards substantially mitigate reward over-optimization and deliver effective LLM post-training improvements.

Reservoir systems are complex dynamic objects with distributed parameters described by systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods for modeling such systems, despite their high accuracy, are characterized by significant time costs for performing calculations, which limits their applicability in control and decision support problems. The proposed architecture (TFNO-opt) is based on Fourier neural operators, which allow approximating PDE solutions in infinite-dimensional functional spaces, providing invariance to discretization and the possibility of generalization to various implementations of equations. The developed modifications are aimed at increasing the accuracy and stability of the trained neural operator, which is especially important for control problems. These include adjustable internal time resolution of the integral Fourier operator, tensor decomposition of parameters in the spectral domain, use of the Sobolev norm in the error function, and separation of approximation errors and reconstruction of initial conditions for more accurate reproduction of physical processes. The effectiveness of the proposed improvements is confirmed by computational experiments. The practical significance is confirmed by computational experiments using the example of the problem of hydrodynamic modeling of an underground gas storage (UGS), where the acceleration of calculations by six orders of magnitude was achieved, compared to traditional methods.

Most current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens. While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought. Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements (5--35 \\% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space."}

IGNs support both single-and multi-step generation, allowing for a flexible trade-off between computational cost and sample quality. But similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), conventional IGNs require adversarial training and are prone to training instabilities and mode collapse. Diffusion and score-based models are popular approaches to generative modeling that iteratively transport samples from one distribution, usually a Gaussian, to a target data distribution. These models have gained popularity due to their stable training dynamics and high-fidelity generation quality. However, this stability and quality come at the cost of high computational cost, as the data must be transported incrementally along the entire trajectory. New sampling methods, model distillation, and consistency models have been developed to reduce the sampling cost and even perform one-shot sampling from diffusion models. In this work, we unite diffusion and IGNs by distilling idempotent models from diffusion model scores, called SIGN. Our proposed method is highly stable and does not require adversarial losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of our proposed score-based training methods and empirically show that IGNs can be effectively distilled from a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling faster inference than iterative score-based models. SIGNs can perform multi-step sampling, allowing users to trade off quality for efficiency. These models operate directly on the source domain; they can project corrupted or alternate distributions back onto the target manifold, enabling zero-shot editing of inputs.

Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance, background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding 10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance, with ImageFX outputs being 85\\% male, Grok 86.6\\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\\% male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted activities were frequently observed across all three models. Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans, offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics and cultural nuances.

Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across semantic granularities and erasure set sizes.

Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each graph in an equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior.

However, they often suffer from hallucinations in knowledge-intensive domains due to their reliance on static pretraining corpora. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources during inference. Among these sources, textual graphs provide structured and semantically rich information that supports more precise and interpretable reasoning. This has led to growing interest in graph-based RAG systems. Despite their potential, most existing approaches rely on a single retriever to identify relevant subgraphs, which limits their ability to capture the diverse aspects of complex queries. Moreover, these systems often struggle to accurately judge the relevance of retrieved content, making them prone to distraction by irrelevant noise. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose MIXRAG, a Mixture-of-Experts Graph-RAG framework that introduces multiple specialized graph retrievers and a dynamic routing controller to better handle diverse query intents. Each retriever is trained to focus on a specific aspect of graph semantics, such as entities, relations, or subgraph topology. A Mixture-of-Experts module adaptively selects and fuses relevant retrievers based on the input query. To reduce noise in the retrieved information, we introduce a query-aware GraphEncoder that carefully analyzes relationships within the retrieved subgraphs, highlighting the most relevant parts while down-weighting unnecessary noise.

Our analysis reveals that high-level semantic representations (derived from the final layer of wav2vec 2.0/Hubert) exert a dominant role in emotion encoding, outperforming low-level acoustic features with significantly stronger mappings to behavioral annotations and dynamic neural synchrony across most brain regions ($p < 0.05$).

Our approach uses a multi-target architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA).

Addressing these challenges in a normal (non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative & economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously (termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy, even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.'}

In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts, and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent improvement over its backbone.

Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation metric for the relevance of multiple modalities (N modalities, N>=3) via multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by 13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods.

First, we leverage salient object detection and foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge prediction.

We collected hundreds of thousands of data points across several models and found significant differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem type.

Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover, text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps: firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts, the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content."}

While existing approaches attempt to improve performance through context selection based on predefined context quality assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality contexts while preserving critical information.

This model development and validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%, representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67% and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich clinical text.

Through systematic experiments across HaluEval\'s question answering, dialogue, and summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\\% of feature dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining accuracy.'}

DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.'}

Memory is not a static store but the ability to re-enter latent cycles in neural state space, with invariant cycles serving as carriers of meaning by filtering order-specific noise and preserving what persists across contexts. The dot-cycle dichotomy captures this: transient dots scaffold exploration, while nontrivial cycles encode low-entropy content invariants that stabilize memory. Biologically, polychronous neural groups realize 1-cycles through delay-locked spiking reinforced by STDP, nested within theta-gamma rhythms that enforce boundary cancellation. These micro-cycles compose hierarchically, extending navigation loops into general memory and cognition. The perception-action cycle introduces high-order invariance: closure holds even across sense-act alternations, generalizing ancestral homing behavior. Sheaf-cosheaf duality formalizes this process: sheaves glue perceptual fragments into global sections, cosheaves decompose global plans into actions and closure aligns top-down predictions with bottom-up cycles. Consciousness then arises as the persistence of high-order invariants that integrate (unity) yet differentiate (richness) across contexts. We conclude that cycle is all you need: persistent invariants enable generalization in non-ergodic environments with long-term coherence at minimal energetic cost.'}

However, there is limited understanding of the advantages and limitations of these models, and it is also unclear how deep learning-based fire spread models can be compared with existing non-AI fire models. In this work, we assess the ability of five typical deep learning models integrated with weather and environmental variables for wildfire spread prediction based on over ten years of wildfire data in the state of Hawaii. We further use the 2023 Maui fires as a case study to compare the best deep learning models with a widely-used fire spread model, FARSITE. The results show that two deep learning models, i.e., ConvLSTM and ConvLSTM with attention, perform the best among the five tested AI models. FARSITE shows higher precision, lower recall, and higher F1-score than the best AI models, while the AI models offer higher flexibility for the input data. By integrating AI models with an explainable AI method, we further identify important weather and environmental factors associated with the 2023 Maui wildfires.'}

To address this, we introduce PIR-RAG, a practical system for privacy-preserving RAG. PIR-RAG employs a novel architecture that uses coarse-grained semantic clustering to prune the search space, combined with a fast, lattice-based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol. This design allows for the efficient retrieval of entire document clusters, uniquely optimizing for the end-to-end RAG workflow where full document content is required. Our comprehensive evaluation against strong baseline architectures, including graph-based PIR and Tiptoe-style private scoring, demonstrates PIR-RAG\'s scalability and its superior performance in terms of "RAG-Ready Latency"-the true end-to-end time required to securely fetch content for an LLM. Our work establishes PIR-RAG as a viable and highly efficient solution for privacy in large-scale AI systems.'}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2509.21324', 'title': 'From Search to Reasoning: A Five-Level RAG Capability Framework for Enterprise Data', 'authors': 'Gurbinder Gill, Ritvik Gupta, Denis Lusson, Anand Chandrashekar, Donald Nguyen', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21324', 'abstract': 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the standard paradigm for answering questions on enterprise data. Traditionally, RAG has centered on text-based semantic search and re-ranking. However, this approach falls short when dealing with questions beyond data summarization or non-text data. This has led to various attempts to supplement RAG to bridge the gap between RAG, the implementation paradigm, and the question answering problem that enterprise users expect it to solve. Given that contemporary RAG is a collection of techniques rather than a defined implementation, discussion of RAG and related question-answering systems benefits from a problem-oriented understanding.\nWe propose a new classification framework (L1-L5) to categorize systems based on data modalities and task complexity of the underlying question answering problems: L1 (Surface Knowledge of Unstructured Data) through L4 (Reflective and Reasoned Knowledge) and the aspirational L5 (General Intelligence). We also introduce benchmarks aligned with these levels and evaluate four state-of-the-art platforms: LangChain, Azure AI Search, OpenAI, and Corvic AI. Our experiments highlight the value of multi-space retrieval and dynamic orchestration for enabling L1-L4 capabilities. We empirically validate our findings using diverse datasets indicative of enterprise use cases.'}
