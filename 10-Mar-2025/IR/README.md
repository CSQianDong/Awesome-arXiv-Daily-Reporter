**Abstract**: Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over the past two decades, search and recommendation systems (collectively referred to as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities. This paper explores the transformative potential of large language model agents in enhancing search and recommendation systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing current challenges in search and recommendation, providing insights into future research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers on agent-based simulation with large language models at this link: this https URL.

**Abstract**: Social media platforms, increasingly used as news sources for varied data analytics, have transformed how information is generated and disseminated. However, the unverified nature of this content raises concerns about trustworthiness and accuracy, potentially negatively impacting readers' critical judgment due to disinformation. This work aims to contribute to the automatic data quality validation field, addressing the rapid growth of online content on wiki pages. Our scalable solution includes stream-based data processing with feature engineering, feature analysis and selection, stream-based classification, and real-time explanation of prediction outcomes. The explainability dashboard is designed for the general public, who may need more specialized knowledge to interpret the model's prediction. Experimental results on two datasets attain approximately 90 % values across all evaluation metrics, demonstrating robust and competitive performance compared to works in the literature. In summary, the system assists editors by reducing their effort and time in detecting disinformation.

**Authors**: Qijiong Liu, Jieming Zhu, Lu Fan, Kun Wang, Hengchang Hu, Wei Guo, Yong Liu, Xiao-Ming Wu

**Abstract**: In recent years, integrating large language models (LLMs) into recommender systems has created new opportunities for improving recommendation quality. However, a comprehensive benchmark is needed to thoroughly evaluate and compare the recommendation capabilities of LLMs with traditional recommender systems. In this paper, we introduce RecBench, which systematically investigates various item representation forms (including unique identifier, text, semantic embedding, and semantic identifier) and evaluates two primary recommendation tasks, i.e., click-through rate prediction (CTR) and sequential recommendation (SeqRec). Our extensive experiments cover up to 17 large models and are conducted across five diverse datasets from fashion, news, video, books, and music domains. Our findings indicate that LLM-based recommenders outperform conventional recommenders, achieving up to a 5% AUC improvement in the CTR scenario and up to a 170% NDCG@10 improvement in the SeqRec scenario. However, these substantial performance gains come at the expense of significantly reduced inference efficiency, rendering the LLM-as-RS paradigm impractical for real-time recommendation environments. We aim for our findings to inspire future research, including recommendation-specific model acceleration methods. We will release our code, data, configurations, and platform to enable other researchers to reproduce and build upon our experimental results.

# MOHPER: Multi-objective Hyperparameter Optimization Framework for E-commerce Retrieval System 

**Authors**: Jungbae Park, Heonseok Jang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05227)  

**Abstract**: E-commerce search optimization has evolved to include a wider range of metrics that reflect user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Utilizing Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes both CTR, CTCVR, and relevant objectives, focusing on engagement and conversion of the users. In addition, to improve the selection of the best configuration from multi-objective optimization, we suggest advanced methods for hyperparameter selection, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optimal configurations, to improve speeds of training and efficiency. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.

# Bridging Classical and Quantum String Matching: A Computational Reformulation of Bit-Parallelism 

**Authors**: Simone Faro, Arianna Pavone, Caterina Viola  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05596)  

**Abstract**: String matching is a fundamental problem in computer science, with critical applications in text retrieval, bioinformatics, and data analysis. Among the numerous solutions that have emerged for this problem in recent decades, bit-parallelism has significantly enhanced their practical efficiency, leading to the development of several optimized approaches for both exact and approximate string matching. However, their potential in quantum computing remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a novel pathway that not only translates bit-parallel string matching algorithms into the quantum framework but also enhances their performance to achieve a quadratic speedup through Grover's search. By embedding quantum search within a bit-parallel model, we reduce the time complexity of string matching, establishing a structured pathway for transforming classical algorithms into quantum solutions with provable computational advantages. Beyond exact matching, this technique offers a foundation for tackling a wide range of non-standard string matching problems, opening new avenues for efficient text searching in the quantum era. To demonstrate the simplicity and adaptability of the technique presented in this paper, we apply this translation and adaptation process to two landmark bit-parallel algorithms: Shift-And for exact pattern matching and Shift-Add for approximate string matching with up to k errors.

# R1-Searcher: Incentivizing the Search Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Huatong Song, Jinhao Jiang, Yingqian Min, Jie Chen, Zhipeng Chen, Wayne Xin Zhao, Lei Fang, Ji-Rong Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05592)  

**Abstract**: Existing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs). While they achieve remarkable performance on challenging tasks such as mathematics and coding, they often rely on their internal knowledge to solve problems, which can be inadequate for time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive questions, leading to inaccuracies and hallucinations. To address this, we propose \textbf{R1-Searcher}, a novel two-stage outcome-based RL approach designed to enhance the search capabilities of LLMs. This method allows LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems to access additional knowledge during the reasoning process. Our framework relies exclusively on RL, without requiring process rewards or distillation for a cold start. % effectively generalizing to out-of-domain datasets and supporting both Base and Instruct models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods, even when compared to the closed-source GPT-4o-mini.

# LoRACode: LoRA Adapters for Code Embeddings 

**Authors**: Saumya Chaturvedi, Aman Chadha, Laurent Bindschaedler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05315)  

**Abstract**: Code embeddings are essential for semantic code search; however, current approaches often struggle to capture the precise syntactic and contextual nuances inherent in code. Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations.

# Dynamic-KGQA: A Scalable Framework for Generating Adaptive Question Answering Datasets 

**Authors**: Preetam Prabhu Srikar Dammu, Himanshu Naidu, Chirag Shah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05049)  

**Abstract**: As question answering (QA) systems advance alongside the rapid evolution of foundation models, the need for robust, adaptable, and large-scale evaluation benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. Traditional QA benchmarks are often static and publicly available, making them susceptible to data contamination and memorization by large language models (LLMs). Consequently, static benchmarks may overestimate model generalization and hinder a reliable assessment of real-world performance. In this work, we introduce Dynamic-KGQA, a scalable framework for generating adaptive QA datasets from knowledge graphs (KGs), designed to mitigate memorization risks while maintaining statistical consistency across iterations. Unlike fixed benchmarks, Dynamic-KGQA generates a new dataset variant on every run while preserving the underlying distribution, enabling fair and reproducible evaluations. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over dataset characteristics, supporting domain-specific and topic-focused QA dataset generation. Additionally, Dynamic-KGQA produces compact, semantically coherent subgraphs that facilitate both training and evaluation of KGQA models, enhancing their ability to leverage structured knowledge effectively. To align with existing evaluation protocols, we also provide static large-scale train/test/validation splits, ensuring comparability with prior methods. By introducing a dynamic, customizable benchmarking paradigm, Dynamic-KGQA enables a more rigorous and adaptable evaluation of QA systems.

# Collapse of Dense Retrievers: Short, Early, and Literal Biases Outranking Factual Evidence 

**Authors**: Mohsen Fayyaz, Ali Modarressi, Hinrich Schuetze, Nanyun Peng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05037)  

**Abstract**: Dense retrieval models are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid failures. In this work, by repurposing a relation extraction dataset (e.g. Re-DocRED), we design controlled experiments to quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as favoring shorter documents, in retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. Our findings reveal significant vulnerabilities: retrievers often rely on superficial patterns like over-prioritizing document beginnings, shorter documents, repeated entities, and literal matches. Additionally, they tend to overlook whether the document contains the query's answer, lacking deep semantic understanding. Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 3% of cases over a biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where retrieval-preferred documents can mislead LLMs, resulting in a 34% performance drop than not providing any documents at all.

# Beyond RAG: Task-Aware KV Cache Compression for Comprehensive Knowledge Reasoning 

**Authors**: Giulio Corallo, Orion Weller, Fabio Petroni, Paolo Papotti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04973)  

**Abstract**: Incorporating external knowledge in large language models (LLMs) enhances their utility across diverse applications, but existing methods have trade-offs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fetches evidence via similarity search, but key information may fall outside top ranked results. Long-context models can process multiple documents but are computationally expensive and limited by context window size. Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04972)  

**Abstract**: Despite advancements in state-of-the-art models and information retrieval techniques, current systems still struggle to handle temporal information and to correctly answer detailed questions about past events. In this paper, we investigate the impact of temporal characteristics of answers in Question Answering (QA) by exploring several simple answer selection techniques. Our findings emphasize the role of temporal features in selecting the most relevant answers from diachronic document collections and highlight differences between explicit and implicit temporal questions.

# Optimizing Multi-Hop Document Retrieval Through Intermediate Representations 

**Authors**: Jiaen Lin, Jingyu Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04796)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) encounters challenges when addressing complex queries, particularly multi-hop questions. While several methods tackle multi-hop queries by iteratively generating internal queries and retrieving external documents, these approaches are computationally expensive. In this paper, we identify a three-stage information processing pattern in LLMs during layer-by-layer reasoning, consisting of extraction, processing, and subsequent extraction steps. This observation suggests that the representations in intermediate layers contain richer information compared to those in other layers. Building on this insight, we propose Layer-wise RAG (L-RAG). Unlike prior methods that focus on generating new internal queries, L-RAG leverages intermediate representations from the middle layers, which capture next-hop information, to retrieve external knowledge. L-RAG achieves performance comparable to multi-step approaches while maintaining inference overhead similar to that of standard RAG. Experimental results show that L-RAG outperforms existing RAG methods on open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets, including MuSiQue, HotpotQA, and 2WikiMultiHopQA.
