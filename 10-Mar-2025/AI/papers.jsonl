We also emphasize the importance of three structural criteria for ontology assessment, alongside expert qualitative evaluation, highlighting the need for a multi-dimensional evaluation in order to capture the quality and usability of the generated ontologies. Our experiments, conducted on a benchmark dataset of ten ontologies with 100 distinct CQs and 29 different user stories, compare the performance of three LLMs using the two prompting techniques. The results demonstrate improvements over the current state-of-the-art in LLM-supported ontology engineering.

Traditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that diverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity of agent behavior. Our environment addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB visual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate human cognitive processes during gameplay. The VLM-Attention framework consists of three integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with specialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and battlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that leverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions, and (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated multi-agent behavior. Our experimental evaluation across 21 custom scenarios demonstrates that VLM-based agents powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can execute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving comparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial training iterations.

Recent research highlights the importance of environmental contexts (e.g., maps) and the "multi-modality" of trajectories, leading to increasingly complex model structures. However, real-world deployments require lightweight models that can quickly migrate and adapt to new environments. Additionally, the core motivations of road agents, referred to as their intentions, deserves further exploration. In this study, we advocate that understanding and reasoning road agents\' intention plays a key role in trajectory prediction tasks, and the main challenge is that the concept of intention is fuzzy and abstract. To this end, we present INTENT, an efficient intention-guided trajectory prediction model that relies solely on information contained in the road agent\'s trajectory. Our model distinguishes itself from existing models in several key aspects: (i) We explicitly model road agents\' intentions through contrastive clustering, accommodating the fuzziness and abstraction of human intention in their trajectories. (ii) The proposed INTENT is based solely on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), resulting in reduced training and inference time, making it very efficient and more suitable for real-world deployment. (iii) By leveraging estimated intentions and an innovative algorithm for transforming trajectory observations, we obtain more robust trajectory representations that lead to superior prediction accuracy.

Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order models, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply provide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct sim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL framework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a large volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance estimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate the framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient algorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results across a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when target-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward and improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use high-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more high-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target environment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe that MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity environment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not only offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also provides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy performance and data collection costs.'}

However, selecting experts at the task level is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that Symbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation."}

While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs, they are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios (e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious features in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of LLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through controlled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features are harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes.

By training an ensemble of world models, the agent actively explores high uncertainty regions of environments without any task specific feedback. This approach yields a task agnostic latent representation, allowing for rapid zero shot or few shot fine tuning on downstream driving tasks such as lane following and collision avoidance. Experimental results in both seen and unseen environments demonstrate that InDRiVE achieves higher success rates and fewer infractions compared to DreamerV2 and DreamerV3 baselines despite using significantly fewer training steps.

We find that replacing the flattening of output feature maps in Impala-CNN with global average pooling leads to a notable performance improvement. This approach outperforms larger and more complex models in the Procgen Benchmark, particularly in terms of generalization. We call our proposed encoder model Impoola-CNN. A decrease in the network's translation sensitivity may be central to this improvement, as we observe the most significant gains in games without agent-centered observations.

This entanglement complicates the interpretation of concepts in isolation and can lead to undesired effects in CAV applications, such as activation steering. To address this issue, we introduce a post-hoc concept disentanglement method that employs a non-orthogonality loss, facilitating the identification of orthogonal concept directions while preserving directional correctness. We evaluate our approach with real-world and controlled correlated concepts in CelebA and a synthetic FunnyBirds dataset with VGG16 and ResNet18 architectures.

To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process.

To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic shift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with a row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts. Furthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to reformulate classifier training as a reconstruction process.

Our model extracts and merges features from OCT images in both Cartesian and polar coordinates, where each column of the image represents an A-line. Our method detects the presence of attenuation artifacts in OCT frames reaching F-scores of 0.77 and 0.94 for mild and severe artifacts, respectively. The inference time over a full OCT scan is approximately 6 seconds. Our experiments show that analysis of images represented in both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems outperforms the analysis in polar coordinates only, suggesting that these representations contain complementary features. This work lays the foundation for automated artifact assessment and image acquisition guidance in intracoronary OCT imaging.'}

However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlook the fundamental role of individual neurons and their connectivity, resulting in a lack of interpretability in both the merging process and the merged models. In this work, we present the first study on the impact of neuronal alignment in model merging. We decompose task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate neuron sensitivity and input adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduce NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks.

However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.'}

By framing PbRL as a two-player game between a policy and a model, our approach enforces conservatism in a tractable manner. Using standard assumptions on function approximation and bounded trajectory concentrability, we derive a sample complexity bound.

Model editing has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with minimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically identifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired knowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects that parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More critically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and continuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these shortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we provide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions: reliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that all ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across multiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then propose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR), for knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses LLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated knowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query falls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant external knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise, the query is answered directly. We evaluate SCR against the ten model editing methods on two counterfactual datasets with three backbone LLMs. Empirical results confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of contextual reasoning for knowledge updating."}

However, offline reinforcement learning suffers challenges due to the distributional shift between the learned and behavior policies, leading to errors when computing Q-values for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To mitigate this issue, policy constraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the distribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the support of the behavior policy. However, current policy constraint methods tend to exhibit excessive conservatism, hindering the policy from further surpassing the behavior policy's performance. In this work, we present Only Support Constraint (OSC) which is derived from maximizing the total probability of learned policy in the support of behavior policy, to address the conservatism of policy constraint. OSC presents a regularization term that only restricts policies to the support without imposing extra constraints on actions within the support. Additionally, to fully harness the performance of the new policy constraints, OSC utilizes a diffusion model to effectively characterize the support of behavior policies.

The restriction to the access of EMG data from deeper muscles poses a considerable obstacle to the broad adoption of EMG-driven modeling techniques. A strategic alternative is to use an estimation algorithm to approximate the missing EMG signals from deeper muscle.

To address these issues, we present two differently sized MoE large language models (LLMs), namely Ling-Lite and Ling-Plus (referred to as "Bailing" in Chinese, spelled Bǎilíng in Pinyin). Ling-Lite contains 16.8 billion parameters with 2.75 billion activated parameters, while Ling-Plus boasts 290 billion parameters with 28.8 billion activated parameters. Both models exhibit comparable performance to leading industry benchmarks. This report offers actionable insights to improve the efficiency and accessibility of AI development in resource-constrained settings, promoting more scalable and sustainable technologies. Specifically, to reduce training costs for large-scale MoE models, we propose innovative methods for (1) optimization of model architecture and training processes, (2) refinement of training anomaly handling, and (3) enhancement of model evaluation efficiency. Additionally, leveraging high-quality data generated from knowledge graphs, our models demonstrate superior capabilities in tool use compared to other models. Ultimately, our experimental findings demonstrate that a 300B MoE LLM can be effectively trained on lower-performance devices while achieving comparable performance to models of a similar scale, including dense and MoE models. Compared to high-performance devices, utilizing a lower-specification hardware system during the pre-training phase demonstrates significant cost savings, reducing computing costs by approximately 20%.

Specifically, we first design the View Projection Module (VPM) to project the 3D point cloud into six planes to maximally retain the original spatial information. Features of six planes are extracted by the 2D encoder and sent to the HexPlane Association Module (HAM) to adaptively fuse the most informative information for each point. The fused point features are further fed to the task head to yield the ultimate predictions. Compared to the popular point and voxel representation, the HexPlane representation is efficient and can utilize highly optimized 2D operations to process sparse and unordered 3D point clouds. It can also leverage off-the-shelf 2D models, network weights, and training recipes to achieve accurate scene understanding in 3D space. On ScanNet and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, our algorithm, dubbed HexNet3D, achieves competitive performance with previous algorithms. In particular, on the ScanNet 3D segmentation task, our method obtains 77.0 mIoU on the validation set, surpassing Point Transformer V2 by 1.6 mIoU.

We argue that gains are mostly due to scale by demonstrating that naively scaling up a simple MTRL baseline to match parameter counts outperforms the more sophisticated architectures, and these gains benefit most from scaling the critic over the actor. Additionally, we explore the training stability advantages that come with task diversity, demonstrating that increasing the number of tasks can help mitigate plasticity loss.

To solve this problem, we propose a framework that uses serialized Finite State Machine (FSM) to generate demonstrations and improve the success rate in manipulation tasks requiring a long sequence of precise interactions. To validate its effectiveness, we use environmentally evolving and long-horizon puzzles that require long sequential actions.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temporal Segment Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (TS-LIF) model, featuring a novel dual-compartment architecture. The dendritic and somatic compartments specialize in capturing distinct frequency components, providing functional heterogeneity that enhances the neuron's ability to process both low- and high-frequency information. Furthermore, the newly introduced direct somatic current injection reduces information loss during intra-neuronal transmission, while dendritic spike generation improves multi-scale information extraction. We provide a theoretical stability analysis of the TS-LIF model and explain how each compartment contributes to distinct frequency response characteristics. Experimental results show that TS-LIF outperforms traditional SNNs in time series forecasting, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness, even with missing data. TS-LIF advances the application of SNNs in time-series forecasting, providing a biologically inspired approach that captures complex temporal dynamics and offers potential for practical implementation in diverse forecasting scenarios.

In this paper, we contribute to the field by exploring how insights gained from hyperparameter importance assessment (HIA) can be leveraged to accelerate HPO, reducing both time and computational resources. Building on prior work that quantified hyperparameter importance by evaluating 10 hyperparameters on CNNs using 10 common image classification datasets, we implement a novel HPO strategy called 'Sequential Grouping.' That prior work assessed the importance weights of the investigated hyperparameters based on their influence on model performance, providing valuable insights that we leverage to optimize our HPO process.

The use of abstract models contrasts with much recent work in robot learning that uses a high-fidelity simulator and reinforcement learning (RL) to obtain policies for physical robots. Motivated by this difference, we investigate the extent to which so-called abstract simulators can be used for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and the resulting policies successfully deployed on teams of physical robots. An abstract simulator models the robot's target task at a high-level of abstraction and discards many details of the world that could impact optimal decision-making. Policies are trained in an abstract simulator then transferred to the physical robot by making use of separately-obtained low-level perception and motion control modules. We identify three key categories of modifications to the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots: simulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation stochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to determine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer in cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies produced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior architecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach leads to a similar level of performance. Broadly we show that MARL can be use to train cooperative physical robot behaviors using highly abstract models of the world."}

These prompts behave much like traditional software in that they take inputs, generate outputs, and perform some specific function. However, prompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to ensure that they are robust. For example, unlike traditional software the output of a prompt depends on the AI model that interprets it. Also, while natural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to predict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with respect to the model running them are required.\nTo address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to automatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex extracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to generate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental in identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to understand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to generate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the generated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to produce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in more invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test generator. Furthermore, by extracting concrete specifications from the input prompt, PromptPex allows prompt writers to clearly understand and test specific aspects of their prompts.

Our method decomposes complex tasks into sub-actions and maintains three key data structures: task memory structure, 2D topology graphs, and 3D spatial networks, achieving high-precision spatial-semantic fusion. These three components collectively accumulate and store critical information throughout task execution, providing rich context for our task-oriented VLM interaction mechanism. This enables VLMs to dynamically adjust guidance based on real-time feedback, generating precise action plans and facilitating step-wise error correction.

Compressed sensing has been developed to minimize image artifacts in accelerated scans, but the required iterative reconstruction is computationally complex and difficult to generalize on new cases. Image-domain-based deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural networks) emerged as a faster alternative but face challenges in modeling continuous k-space, a problem amplified with non-Cartesian sampling commonly used in accelerated acquisition. In comparison, implicit neural representations can model continuous signals in the frequency domain and thus are compatible with arbitrary k-space sampling patterns. The current study develops a novel generative-adversarially trained implicit neural representations (k-GINR) for de novo undersampled non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction. k-GINR consists of two stages: 1) supervised training on an existing patient cohort; 2) self-supervised patient-specific optimization. In stage 1, the network is trained with the generative-adversarial network on diverse patients of the same anatomical region supervised by fully sampled acquisition. In stage 2, undersampled k-space data of individual patients is used to tailor the prior-embedded network for patient-specific optimization. The UCSF StarVIBE T1-weighted liver dataset was evaluated on the proposed framework. k-GINR is compared with an image-domain deep learning method, Deep Cascade CNN, and a compressed sensing method. k-GINR consistently outperformed the baselines with a larger performance advantage observed at very high accelerations (e.g., 20 times). k-GINR offers great value for direct non-Cartesian k-space reconstruction for new incoming patients across a wide range of accelerations liver anatomy.'}

As one of the main biomarkers in the AD diagnosis procedure, brain amyloid positivity is typically identified by positron emission tomography (PET), which is costly and invasive. Brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) may provide a safer and more convenient solution for the AD diagnosis. Recent advances in geometric deep learning have facilitated sMRI analysis and early diagnosis of AD. However, determining AD pathology, such as brain amyloid deposition, in preclinical stage remains challenging, as less significant morphological changes can be observed. As a result, few AD classification models are generalizable to the brain amyloid positivity classification task. Blood-based biomarkers (BBBMs), on the other hand, have recently achieved remarkable success in predicting brain amyloid positivity and identifying individuals with high risk of being brain amyloid positive. However, individuals in medium risk group still require gold standard tests such as Amyloid PET for further evaluation. Inspired by the recent success of transformer architectures, we propose a geometric deep learning model based on transformer that is both scalable and robust to variations in input volumetric mesh size.

Compared to dense transformers that require the same amount of floating point operations (FLOPs) per forward pass, MoEs benefit from improved sample efficiency at training time and achieve much stronger performance. Many closed-source and open-source frontier language models have thus adopted an MoE architecture. Naturally, practitioners will want to extend the capabilities of these models with large amounts of newly collected data without completely re-training them. Prior work has shown that a simple combination of replay and learning rate re-warming and re-decaying can enable the continual pre-training (CPT) of dense decoder-only transformers with minimal performance degradation compared to full re-training. In the case of decoder-only MoE transformers, however, it is unclear how the routing algorithm will impact continual pre-training performance: 1) do the MoE transformer's routers exacerbate forgetting relative to a dense model?; 2) do the routers maintain a balanced load on previous distributions after CPT?; 3) are the same strategies applied to dense models sufficient to continually pre-train MoE LLMs? In what follows, we conduct a large-scale (>2B parameter switch and DeepSeek MoE LLMs trained for 600B tokens) empirical study across four MoE transformers to answer these questions. Our results establish a surprising robustness to distribution shifts for both Sinkhorn-Balanced and Z-and-Aux-loss-balanced routing algorithms, even in MoEs continually pre-trained without replay. Moreover, we show that MoE LLMs maintain their sample efficiency (relative to a FLOP-matched dense model) during CPT and that they can match the performance of a fully re-trained MoE at a fraction of the cost."}

Inspired by students condensing study material for open-book exams, we propose task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This enables LLMs to reason efficiently over a compacted representation of all relevant information. Experiments show our approach outperforms both RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. On LongBench v2, it improves accuracy by up to 7 absolute points over RAG with a 30x compression rate, while reducing inference latency from 0.43s to 0.16s. A synthetic dataset highlights that RAG performs well when sparse evidence suffices, whereas task-aware compression is superior for broad knowledge tasks.'}

Split Federated Learning (SFL) facilitates privacy-preserving FM fine-tuning on resource-constrained local devices by offloading partial FM computations to edge servers, enabling device-edge synergistic fine-tuning. Practical edge networks often host multiple SFL tenants to support diversified downstream tasks. However, existing research primarily focuses on single-tenant SFL scenarios, and lacks tailored incentive mechanisms for multi-tenant settings, which are essential to effectively coordinate self-interested local devices for participation in various downstream tasks, ensuring that each SFL tenant's distinct FM fine-tuning requirements (e.g., FM types, performance targets, and fine-tuning deadlines) are met. To address this gap, we propose a novel Price-Incentive Mechanism (PRINCE) that guides multiple SFL tenants to offer strategic price incentives, which solicit high-quality device participation for efficient FM fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a bias-resilient global SFL model aggregation scheme to eliminate model biases caused by independent device participation. We then derive a rigorous SFL convergence bound to evaluate the contributions of heterogeneous devices to FM performance improvements, guiding the incentive strategies of SFL tenants. Furthermore, we model inter-tenant device competition as a congestion game for Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) analysis, deriving each SFL tenant's optimal incentive strategy. Extensive simulations involving four representative SFL tenant types (ViT, BERT, Whisper, and LLaMA) across diverse data modalities (text, images, and audio) demonstrate that PRINCE accelerates FM fine-tuning by up to 3.07x compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while consistently meeting fine-tuning performance targets."}

PVP4Real enables efficient real-time policy learning from online human intervention and demonstration, without reward or any pretraining, significantly improving data efficiency and training safety. We validate our method by training two different robots -- a legged quadruped, and a wheeled delivery robot -- in two mobile robot tasks, one of which even uses raw RGBD image as observation. The training finishes within 15 minutes. Our experiments show the promising future of human-in-the-loop learning in addressing the data efficiency issue in real-world robotic tasks.

Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.'}

Most existing ITE estimation methods are designed for centralized settings. However, in real-world clinical scenarios, the raw data are usually not shareable among hospitals due to the potential privacy and security risks, which makes the methods not applicable. In this work, we study the ITE estimation task in a federated setting, which allows us to harness the decentralized data from multiple hospitals. Due to the unavoidable confounding bias in the collected data, a model directly learned from it would be inaccurate. One well-known solution is Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting (IPTW), which uses the conditional probability of treatment given the covariates to re-weight each training example. Applying IPTW in a federated setting, however, is non-trivial. We found that even with a well-estimated conditional probability, the local model training step using each hospital's data alone would still suffer from confounding bias. To address this, we propose FED-IPTW, a novel algorithm to extend IPTW into a federated setting that enforces both global (over all the data) and local (within each hospital) decorrelation between covariates and treatments. We validated our approach on the task of comparing the treatment effects of mechanical ventilation on improving survival probability for patients with breadth difficulties in the intensive care unit (ICU). We conducted experiments on both synthetic and real-world eICU datasets and the results show that FED-IPTW outperform state-of-the-art methods on all the metrics on factual prediction and ITE estimation tasks, paving the way for personalized treatment strategy design in mechanical ventilation usage."}

However, the aspect of internal language learning, where language serves not only as a communicative tool with others but also as a means for individual thinking, self-reflection, and problem-solving remains underexplored. Developing a language through self-play, without another agent's involvement, poses a unique challenge. It requires an agent to craft symbolic representations and train them using direct gradient methods. The challenge here is that if an agent attempts to learn symbolic representations through self-play using conventional modeling and techniques such as REINFORCE, the solution will offer no advantage over previous multi-agent approaches. We introduce VQEL, a novel method that incorporates Vector Quantization into the agents' architecture, enabling them to autonomously invent and develop discrete symbolic representations in a self-play referential game. Following the self-play phase, agents can enhance their language through reinforcement learning and interactions with other agents in the mutual-play phase. Our experiments across various datasets demonstrate that VQEL not only outperforms the traditional REINFORCE method but also benefits from improved control and reduced susceptibility to collapse, thanks to the incorporation of vector quantization."}

To address those challenges, we propose Adaptive 3D Scene Representation (Adapt3R), a general-purpose 3D observation encoder which uses a novel architecture to synthesize data from one or more RGBD cameras into a single vector that can then be used as conditioning for arbitrary IL algorithms. The key idea is to use a pretrained 2D backbone to extract semantic information about the scene, using 3D only as a medium for localizing this semantic information with respect to the end-effector. We show that when trained end-to-end with several SOTA multi-task IL algorithms, Adapt3R maintains these algorithms' multi-task learning capacity while enabling zero-shot transfer to novel embodiments and camera poses.

However, detecting AEs is still challenged by significant overlaps between the constructed synthetic losses of adversarial and clean examples due to the absence of ground truth for incoming inputs. TRAIT addresses this challenge by converting the synthetic loss into a spectrum signature, using the technique of Fast Fourier Transform to highlight the discrepancies, drawing inspiration from the temporal nature of the imprints, analogous to time-series signals. Across 12 AE attacks including SMACK (USENIX Sec'2023), TRAIT demonstrates consistent outstanding performance across comprehensively evaluated modalities, tasks, datasets, and model architectures. In all scenarios, TRAIT achieves an AE detection accuracy exceeding 97%, often around 99%, while maintaining a false rejection rate of 1%. TRAIT remains effective under the formulated strong adaptive attacks."}

A well-established framework in social cognition suggests that social judgments are organized along two primary dimensions: valence (e.g., trustworthiness, warmth) and dominance (e.g., power, assertiveness). This study examines whether multimodal generative AI systems can reproduce this valence-dominance structure when evaluating facial images and how their representations align with those observed across world regions. Through principal component analysis (PCA), we found that the extracted dimensions closely mirrored the theoretical structure of valence and dominance, with trait loadings aligning with established definitions. However, many world regions and generative AI models also exhibited a third component, the nature and significance of which warrant further investigation.

Federated learning~(FL), a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, offers a compelling alternative by enabling collaborative model training without the need for data sharing. However, FL-based palmprint verification faces critical challenges, including data heterogeneity from diverse identities and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This paper addresses these gaps by establishing a comprehensive benchmark for FL-based palmprint verification, which explicitly defines and evaluates two practical scenarios: closed-set and open-set verification. We propose FedPalm, a unified FL framework that balances local adaptability with global generalization. Each client trains a personalized textural expert tailored to local data and collaboratively contributes to a shared global textural expert for extracting generalized features. To further enhance verification performance, we introduce a Textural Expert Interaction Module that dynamically routes textural features among experts to generate refined side textural features. Learnable parameters are employed to model relationships between original and side features, fostering cross-texture-expert interaction and improving feature discrimination. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of FedPalm, demonstrating robust performance across both scenarios and providing a promising foundation for advancing FL-based palmprint verification research."}

While multi-modal learning leverages complementary information, most existing methods train only on complete data, ignoring the large proportion of incomplete samples in real-world datasets like ADNI. This reduces the effective training set and limits the full use of valuable medical data. While some methods incorporate incomplete samples, they fail to effectively address inter-modal feature alignment and knowledge transfer challenges under high missing rates. To address this, we propose a Prototype-Guided Adaptive Distillation (PGAD) framework that directly incorporates incomplete multi-modal data into training. PGAD enhances missing modality representations through prototype matching and balances learning with a dynamic sampling strategy. We validate PGAD on the ADNI dataset with varying missing rates (20%, 50%, and 70%) and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of prototype matching and adaptive sampling, highlighting the potential of our framework for robust and scalable AD diagnosis in real-world clinical settings."}

This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for dataset distillation, coined Distilling Dataset into Neural Field (DDiF), which leverages the neural field to store the necessary information of the large-scale dataset. Due to the unique nature of the neural field, which takes coordinates as input and output quantity, DDiF effectively preserves the information and easily generates various shapes of data. We theoretically confirm that DDiF exhibits greater expressiveness than some previous literature when the utilized budget for a single synthetic instance is the same. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DDiF achieves superior performance on several benchmark datasets, extending beyond the image domain to include video, audio, and 3D voxel.

In this paper, we present the first adversarial training (AT) paradigm tailored to defend against jailbreak attacks during the MLLM training phase. Extending traditional AT to this domain poses two critical challenges: efficiently tuning massive parameters and ensuring robustness against attacks across multiple modalities. To address these challenges, we introduce Projection Layer Against Adversarial Training (ProEAT), an end-to-end AT framework. ProEAT incorporates a projector-based adversarial training architecture that efficiently handles large-scale parameters while maintaining computational feasibility by focusing adversarial training on a lightweight projector layer instead of the entire model; additionally, we design a dynamic weight adjustment mechanism that optimizes the loss function's weight allocation based on task demands, streamlining the tuning process. To enhance defense performance, we propose a joint optimization strategy across visual and textual modalities, ensuring robust resistance to jailbreak attacks originating from either modality. Extensive experiments conducted on five major jailbreak attack methods across three mainstream MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ProEAT achieves state-of-the-art defense performance, outperforming existing baselines by an average margin of +34% across text and image modalities, while incurring only a 1% reduction in clean accuracy.

Episodic progressions of these arcs are stored in both relational and semantic (vectorial) databases, enabling structured analysis and comparison. To bridge the gap between automation and critical interpretation, the system is paired with a graphical interface that allows for human refinement using tools to enhance and visualize the data.

Through a comprehensive analysis of embeddings from models fine-tuned for various tasks, our results demonstrate that fine-tuning wav2vec 2.0 effectively achieves phonetic normalization by selectively suppressing task-irrelevant information. We found that models fine-tuned for multiple tasks retain information for both tasks without compromising performance, and that suppressing task-irrelevant information is not necessary for effective classification. These findings provide new insights into how phonetic normalization can be flexibly achieved in speech models and how it is realized in human speech perception.'}

Existing methods rely on static fine-tuning or prompt engineering, which fail to generalize across problem complexities, while the scarcity of high-quality preference data further hinders reliable reasoning.\nWe introduce SPHERE, a self-evolving data generation pipeline that enhances reasoning in small language models (SLMs) by iteratively generating, correcting, and diversifying reasoning chains. SPHERE operates in three stages: (i) Self-Generation, where the model autonomously constructs problem-solving steps; (ii) Self-Correction, enabling it to identify and rectify errors; and (iii) Diversity Induction, improving robustness through multiple valid reasoning trajectories. This self-evolution mechanism strengthens mathematical reasoning and enhances model reliability. Evaluations on MATH 500, GSM8K, AIME, AMC, and Olympiad show that SPHERE-trained models achieve significant gains over their base versions and match/surpass GPT-4o on certain benchmarks.

Existing evaluation methods can be broadly categorized into two types: manual evaluation and automatic evaluation. Manual evaluation, while comprehensive, is often costly and resource-intensive.

To address these challenges, NTCIR-18 introduced the AEOLLM (Automatic Evaluation of LLMs) task, aiming to encourage reference-free evaluation methods that can overcome the limitations of existing approaches. In this paper, to enhance the evaluation performance of the AEOLLM task, we propose three key methods to improve the reference-free evaluation: 1) Multi-model Collaboration: Leveraging multiple LLMs to approximate human ratings across various subtasks; 2) Prompt Auto-optimization: Utilizing LLMs to iteratively refine the initial task prompts based on evaluation feedback from training samples; and 3) In-context Learning (ICL) Optimization: Based on the multi-task evaluation feedback, we train a specialized in-context example retrieval model, combined with a semantic relevance retrieval model, to jointly identify the most effective in-context learning examples.

The multi-attempt task encourages the model to refine its previous attempts and improve search efficiency. Experimental results show that even a small LLM trained on a multi-attempt task achieves significantly higher accuracy when evaluated with more attempts, improving from 45.6% with 1 attempt to 52.5% with 2 attempts on the math benchmark.

Linguistic divergence can sometimes lead to cross-linguistic disagreements--disagreements purely due to semantic differences about a relevant concept. This paper identifies such disagreements as conflicts between two fundamental alignment norms in multilingual LLMs: cross-linguistic consistency (CL-consistency), which seeks universal concepts across languages, and consistency with folk judgments (Folk-consistency), which respects language-specific semantic norms. Through examining responses of conversational multilingual AIs in English and Japanese with the cases used in philosophy (cases of knowledge-how attributions), this study demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs provide divergent and internally inconsistent responses. Such findings reveal a novel qualitative limitation in crosslingual knowledge transfer, or conceptual crosslingual knowledge barriers, challenging the assumption that universal representations and cross-linguistic transfer capabilities are inherently desirable. Moreover, they reveal conflicts of alignment policies of their developers, highlighting critical normative questions for LLM researchers and developers. The implications extend beyond technical alignment challenges, raising normative, moral-political, and metaphysical questions about the ideals underlying AI development--questions that are shared with philosophers and cognitive scientists but for which no one yet has definitive answers, inviting a multidisciplinary approach to balance the practical benefits of cross-linguistic consistency and respect for linguistic diversity.'}

Over the past decade, we have witnessed a seemingly inevitable integration of AI in every facet of our lives. Much has been written about the potential revolutionary impact of AI in education. AI has the potential to completely revolutionise the educational landscape as we could see entire courses and degrees developed by programs such as ChatGPT. AI has the potential to develop courses, set assignments, grade and provide feedback to students much faster than a team of teachers. In addition, because of its dynamic nature, it has the potential to continuously improve its content. In certain fields such as computer science, where technology is continuously evolving, AI based applications can provide dynamically changing, relevant material to students. AI has the potential to replace entire degrees and may challenge the concept of higher education institutions. We could also see entire new disciplines emerge as a consequence of AI. This paper examines the practical impact of ChatGPT and why it is believed that its implementation is a critical step towards a new era of education. We investigate the impact that ChatGPT will have on learning, problem solving skills and cognitive ability of students. We examine the positives, negatives and many other aspects of AI and its applications throughout this paper.'}

In this regard, model evaluations are critical for product and investment-related decision-making. While open evaluation sets like MMLU initially drove progress, concerns around data contamination and data bias have constantly questioned their reliability. As a result, it has led to the rise of private data curators who have begun conducting hidden evaluations with high-quality self-curated test prompts and their own expert annotators. In this paper, we argue that despite potential advantages in addressing contamination issues, private evaluations introduce inadvertent financial and evaluation risks. In particular, the key concerns include the potential conflict of interest arising from private data curators' business relationships with their clients (leading LLM firms). In addition, we highlight that the subjective preferences of private expert annotators will lead to inherent evaluation bias towards the models trained with the private curators' data. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for studying the risks of private evaluations that can lead to wide-ranging community discussions and policy changes."}

This paper aims to establish the idea of the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its prospect in reshaping approaches to assessing students. It creates a system for the evaluation of students performance using Artificial intelligence, and particularly the Gemini API for the generation of questions, grading and report on the students performances. This is to facilitate easy use of the tools in creating, scheduling, and delivering assessments with minimal chances of cheating through options such as full screen and time limit. There are formats of questions in the system which comprises multiple choice, short answers and descriptive questions, developed by Gemini. The most conspicuous feature is the self-checking system whereby the user gets instant feedback for the correct score that each of the students would have scored instantly with explanations about wrong answers. Moreover, the platform has intelligent learning progressions where the user will be able to monitor his/her performances to be recommended a certain level of performance. It will allow students as well as educators to have real-time analytics and feedback on what they are good at and where they need to improve. Not only does it make the assessment easier, but it also improves the levels of accuracy in grading and effectively strengthens a data based learning process for students.'}

A Conceptual Framework enabling the Ethos of AI-driven Higher education', 'authors': 'Prashant Mahajan', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04751', 'abstract': 'The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education (HE) is transforming personalized learning, administrative automation, and decision-making. However, this progress presents a duality, as AI adoption also introduces ethical and institutional challenges, including algorithmic bias, data privacy risks, and governance inconsistencies. To address these concerns, this study introduces the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED) Framework, ensuring compliance with UNESCO and OECD ethical standards. This conceptual research employs a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative studies to identify patterns, contradictions, and gaps in AI adoption within HE. It reinterprets existing datasets through theoretical and ethical lenses to develop governance frameworks. The study applies a participatory integrated co-system, Phased Human Intelligence, SWOC analysis, and AI ethical review boards to assess AI readiness and governance strategies for universities and HE institutions. The HD-AIHED model bridges AI research gaps, addresses global real-time challenges, and provides tailored, scalable, and ethical strategies for diverse educational contexts. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders, this study envisions AIHED as a transparent and equitable force for innovation. The HD-AIHED framework ensures AI acts as a collaborative and ethical enabler rather than a disruptive replacement for human intelligence while advocating for responsible AI implementation in HE.'}

While system safety has emerged as a distinct discipline for a long time, originated from safety concerns in early aircraft manufacturing. The safety assurance is now an indispensable component in safety critical domains. Motivated by the assurance approaches for safety-critical systems such as aviation, this paper introduces the concept of AI ethics assurance cases into the AI ethics assurance. Three pillars of user requirements, evidence, and validation are proposed as key components and integrated into AI ethics assurance cases for a new approach of user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance. The user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance case is set up based on three pillars and hazard analysis methods used in the safety assurance of safety-critical systems. This paper also proposes a platform named Ethical-Lens (E-LENS) to implement the user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance approach. The proposed user requirements-based E-LENS platform is then applied to assure AI ethics of an AI-driven human resource shortlisting system as a case study to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.'}

Recently, this culminated in the publication of the International AI Safety Report, written by 96 experts of which 30 nominated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN). The report focuses on the safety risks of general-purpose AI and available technical mitigation approaches. In this response, informed by a system safety perspective, I refl ect on the key conclusions of the report, identifying fundamental issues in the currently dominant technical framing of AI safety and how this frustrates meaningful discourse and policy efforts to address safety comprehensively. The system safety discipline has dealt with the safety risks of software-based systems for many decades, and understands safety risks in AI systems as sociotechnical and requiring consideration of technical and non-technical factors and their interactions. The International AI Safety report does identify the need for system safety approaches. Lessons, concepts and methods from system safety indeed provide an important blueprint for overcoming current shortcomings in technical approaches by integrating rather than adding on non-technical factors and interventions. I conclude with why building a system safety discipline can help us overcome limitations in the European AI Act, as well as how the discipline can help shape sustainable investments into Public Interest AI.'}

Grounded in cognitive science and moral psychology, PRISM organizes moral concerns into seven "basis worldviews", each hypothesized to capture a distinct dimension of human moral cognition, ranging from survival-focused reflexes through higher-order integrative perspectives. It then applies a Pareto-inspired optimization scheme to reconcile competing priorities without reducing them to a single metric. Under the assumption of reliable context validation for robust use, the framework follows a structured workflow that elicits viewpoint-specific responses, synthesizes them into a balanced outcome, and mediates remaining conflicts in a transparent and iterative manner. By referencing layered approaches to moral cognition from cognitive science, moral psychology, and neuroscience, PRISM clarifies how different moral drives interact and systematically documents and mediates ethical tradeoffs. We illustrate its efficacy through real outputs produced by a working prototype, applying PRISM to classic alignment problems in domains such as public health policy, workplace automation, and education. By anchoring AI deliberation in these human vantage points, PRISM aims to bound interpretive leaps that might otherwise drift into non-human or machine-centric territory. We briefly outline future directions, including real-world deployments and formal verifications, while maintaining the core focus on multi-perspective synthesis and conflict mediation.'}

By establishing such frameworks, we can harness the full potential of AI while mitigating its risks, particularly in high-risk scenarios. This requires the design of responsible AI systems based on trustworthy AI technologies and ethical principles, with the aim of ensuring auditability and accountability throughout their design, development, and deployment, adhering to domain-specific regulations and standards.\nThis paper explores the concept of a responsible AI system from a holistic perspective, which encompasses four key dimensions: 1) regulatory context; 2) trustworthy AI technology along with standardization and assessments; 3) auditability and accountability; and 4) AI governance. The aim of this paper is double. First, we analyze and understand these four dimensions and their interconnections in the form of an analysis and overview. Second, the final goal of the paper is to propose a roadmap in the design of responsible AI systems, ensuring that they can gain society's trust. To achieve this trustworthiness, this paper also fosters interdisciplinary discussions on the ethical, legal, social, economic, and cultural aspects of AI from a global governance perspective.

McLaren', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04737', 'abstract': "Detection of carelessness in digital learning platforms has relied on the contextual slip model, which leverages conditional probability and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) to identify careless errors, where students make mistakes despite having the knowledge. However, this model cannot effectively assess carelessness in questions tagged with multiple skills due to the use of conditional probability. This limitation narrows the scope within which the model can be applied. Thus, we propose a novel model, the Beyond Knowledge Feature Carelessness (BKFC) model. The model detects careless errors using performance factor analysis (PFA) and behavioral features distilled from log data, controlling for knowledge when detecting carelessness. We applied the BKFC to detect carelessness in data from middle school students playing a learning game on decimal numbers and operations. We conducted analyses comparing the careless errors detected using contextual slip to the BKFC model. Unexpectedly, careless errors identified by these two approaches did not align. We found students' post-test performance was (corresponding to past results) positively associated with the carelessness detected using the contextual slip model, while negatively associated with the carelessness detected using the BKFC model. These results highlight the complexity of carelessness and underline a broader challenge in operationalizing carelessness and careless errors."}

We investigate what Large Language Models (LLMs) can contribute to reducing the environmental impacts of food production. We define a typology of design and prediction tasks based on the sustainable food literature and collaboration with domain experts, and evaluate six LLMs on four tasks in our typology. For example, for a sustainable protein design task, food science experts estimated that collaboration with an LLM can reduce time spent by 45% on average, compared to 22% for collaboration with another expert human food scientist. However, for a sustainable menu design task, LLMs produce suboptimal solutions when instructed to consider both human satisfaction and climate impacts. We propose a general framework for integrating LLMs with combinatorial optimization to improve reasoning capabilities. Our approach decreases emissions of food choices by 79% in a hypothetical restaurant while maintaining participants' satisfaction with their set of choices. Our results demonstrate LLMs' potential, supported by optimization techniques, to accelerate sustainable food development and adoption."}
