Each argument in the debate is an observed case from the training data, favouring their labelling. Cases attack or support those with opposing or agreeing labellings, with the strength of each argument and relationship learned through gradient-based methods. This argumentation debate structure provides human-aligned reasoning, improving model interpretability compared to traditional neural networks (NNs). Unlike the existing purely symbolic variant, Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (AA-CBR), Gradual AA-CBR is capable of multi-class classification, automatic learning of feature and data point importance, assigning uncertainty values to outcomes, using all available data points, and does not require binary features. We show that Gradual AA-CBR performs comparably to NNs whilst significantly outperforming existing AA-CBR formulations.'}

Manually designing reward functions is tedious and error-prone. A principled alternative is to specify behaviors in a formal language that can be automatically translated into rewards. Omega-regular languages are a natural choice for this purpose, given their established role in formal verification and synthesis. However, existing methods using omega-regular specifications typically rely on discounted reward RL in episodic settings, with periodic resets. This setup misaligns with the semantics of omega-regular specifications, which describe properties over infinite behavior traces. In such cases, the average reward criterion and the continuing setting -- where the agent interacts with the environment over a single, uninterrupted lifetime -- are more appropriate.\nTo address the challenges of infinite-horizon, continuing tasks, we focus on absolute liveness specifications -- a subclass of omega-regular languages that cannot be violated by any finite behavior prefix, making them well-suited to the continuing setting. We present the first model-free RL framework that translates absolute liveness specifications to average-reward objectives. Our approach enables learning in communicating MDPs without episodic resetting. We also introduce a reward structure for lexicographic multi-objective optimization, aiming to maximize an external average-reward objective among the policies that also maximize the satisfaction probability of a given omega-regular specification. Our method guarantees convergence in unknown communicating MDPs and supports on-the-fly reductions that do not require full knowledge of the environment, thus enabling model-free RL. Empirical results show our average-reward approach in continuing setting outperforms discount-based methods across benchmarks.'}

ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from educational interaction data."}

The goal of value-alignment is to create agents that not only do their tasks but through their behaviours also promote these values. Many of the norms are written as laws or rules (legal / safety norms) but even more remain unwritten (social norms). Furthermore, the techniques used to represent these norms also differ. Safety / legal norms are often represented explicitly, for example, in some logical language while social norms are typically learned and remain hidden in the parameter space of a neural network. There is a lack of approaches in the literature that could combine these various norm representations into a single algorithm. We propose a novel method that integrates these norms into the reinforcement learning process. Our method monitors the agent's compliance with the given norms and summarizes it in a quantity we call the agent's reputation. This quantity is used to weigh the received rewards to motivate the agent to become value-aligned. We carry out a series of experiments including a continuous state space traffic problem to demonstrate the importance of the written and unwritten norms and show how our method can find the value-aligned policies. Furthermore, we carry out ablations to demonstrate why it is better to combine these two groups of norms rather than using either separately."}

A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs."}

We introduce Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs directly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key challenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji reactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model, P[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love Reaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love] into a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and safety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is predictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline evaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love] significantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase in Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive reactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of objectives. By directly leveraging implicit signals from users, RLUF offers a path to aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences at scale.'}

Many authors, and even Husserl himself have developed what they claim to be formal ontologies. I argue that under close inspection, none of these so claimed formal ontologies are truly formal in the Husserlian sense. More concretely, I demonstrate that they violate the two most important notions of formal ontology as developed in Husserl\'s Logical Investigations, namely a priori validity independent of perception and formalism as the total absence of content. I hence propose repositioning the work previously understood as formal ontology as the foundational ontology it really is. This is to recognize the potential of a truly formal ontology in the Husserlian sense. Specifically, I argue that formal ontology following his conditions, allows us to formulate ontological structures, which could capture what is more objectively without presupposing a particular framework arising from perception. I further argue that the ability to design the formal structure deliberately allows us to create highly scalable and interoperable information artifacts. As concrete evidence, I showcase that a class of formal ontology, which uses the axioms of vector spaces, is able to express most of the conceptualizations found in foundational ontologies. Most importantly, I argue that many information systems, specifically artificial intelligence, are likely already using some type of vector ontologies to represent reality in their internal worldviews and elaborate on the evidence that humans do as well. I hence propose a thorough investigation of the ability of vector ontologies to act as a human-machine interoperable ontological framework that allows us to understand highly sophisticated machines and machines to understand us.'}

In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design, output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training.

Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce 3DTown, a training-free framework designed to synthesize realistic and coherent 3D scenes from a single top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware 3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show that 3DTown outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis, Hunyuan3D-2, and TripoSG, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and texture fidelity.

In turn, this requires a large planning horizon which leads to computationally demanding planning problems and reduced performance. Previous work in model free reinforcement learning has partially addressed this issue using action repeats where a policy is learned to determine a discrete action duration. Instead we propose to control the continuous decision timescale directly by using temporally-extended actions and letting the planner treat the duration of the action as an additional optimization variable along with the standard action variables. This additional structure has multiple advantages. It speeds up simulation time of trajectories and, importantly, it allows for deep horizon search in terms of primitive actions while using a shallow search depth in the planner. In addition, in the model based reinforcement learning (MBRL) setting, it reduces compounding errors from model learning and improves training time for models. We show that this idea is effective and that the range for action durations can be automatically selected using a multi-armed bandit formulation and integrated into the MBRL framework. An extensive experimental evaluation both in planning and in MBRL, shows that our approach yields faster planning, better solutions, and that it enables solutions to problems that are not solved in the standard formulation.'}

First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking.

Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%).

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to complete the sketches via stepwise refinement.

Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.'}

As MLLMs are increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages, those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled. These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad implications for multilingual NLP.'}

Our analysis leverages a reduction framework that reduces the offline alignment problem under linear modeling assumptions to parameter estimation in logistic regression. This framework allows us to establish an interesting separation result between LTC and CTL, demonstrating that LTC presents a greater challenge than CTL in offline alignment, even under linear models.

However, its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based split learning model has emerged, offloading most model parameters to the server while retaining only the embedding and output layers on clients to ensure privacy. However, it still faces significant challenges in security, efficiency, and adaptability: 1) embedding gradients are vulnerable to attacks, leading to reverse engineering of private data; 2) the autoregressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FL-LLaMA, a secure, efficient, and adaptive federated split framework based on LLaMA2. First, we place some input and output blocks on the local client and inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states, enabling secure end-to-end propagation. Second, we employ client-batch and server-hierarchical strategies to achieve parallel training, along with attention-mask compression and KV cache mechanisms to accelerate inference, reducing communication costs effectively.

Meanwhile, in-context unlearning, which relies solely on contextual prompting without modifying the model's intrinsic mechanisms, suffers from limited generalizability and struggles to achieve true unlearning. In this work, we introduce UniErase, a novel unlearning paradigm that employs learnable parametric suffix (unlearning token) to steer language models toward targeted forgetting behaviors. UniErase operates through two key phases: (I) an optimization stage that binds desired unlearning outputs to the model's autoregressive probability distribution via token optimization, followed by (II) a lightweight model editing phase that activates the learned token to probabilistically induce specified forgetting objective.

Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware).

We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives.

In particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions. The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback."}

We aim to address this gap by analyzing three datasets with four distinct downstream tasks under three different adversarial attack algorithms. Our findings reveal that while foundation models maintain resilience against conventional transformations, applying high-noise diffusion denoising to clean images without any distortions significantly degrades performance by as high as 57%. Low-noise diffusion settings preserve performance but fail to provide adequate protection across all attack types. Moreover, we introduce a novel attack strategy specifically targeting the diffusion process itself, capable of circumventing defenses in the low-noise regime.

However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation.

We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference concepts in the model\'s concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g., "positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based on the structure of the model\'s vector space. BiasLens combines Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r > 0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a patient\'s insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and transparency in LLMs.'}

However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO (AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.'}

The core contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future deep learning model designs.

We propose a Squeeze-and-Recalibrate (SR) block, a drop-in replacement for linear layers in MIL models to address these challenges. The SR block comprises two core components: a pair of low-rank trainable matrices (squeeze pathway, SP) that reduces parameter count and imposes a bottleneck to prevent spurious feature learning, and a frozen random recalibration matrix that preserves geometric structure, diversifies feature directions, and redefines the optimization objective for the SP. We provide theoretical guarantees that the SR block can approximate any linear mapping to arbitrary precision, thereby ensuring that the performance of a standard MIL model serves as a lower bound for its SR-enhanced counterpart.

We develop new architectures, octic ViTs, that use octic-equivariant layers and put them to the test on both supervised and self-supervised learning. Through extensive experiments on DeiT-III and DINOv2 training on ImageNet-1K, we show that octic ViTs yield more computationally efficient networks while also improving performance. In particular, we achieve approximately 40% reduction in FLOPs for ViT-H while simultaneously improving both classification and segmentation results.'}

This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.'}

Unlike the Neural Network, the SVM solutions are typically more stable, sparse, optimal and interpretable. However, there are only few literature which addresses the UQ in SVM prediction. At first, we provide a comprehensive summary of existing Prediction Interval (PI) estimation and probabilistic forecasting methods developed in the SVM framework and evaluate them against the key properties expected from an ideal PI model. We find that none of the existing SVM PI models achieves a sparse solution. To introduce sparsity in SVM model, we propose the Sparse Support Vector Quantile Regression (SSVQR) model, which constructs PIs and probabilistic forecasts by solving a pair of linear programs. Further, we develop a feature selection algorithm for PI estimation using SSVQR that effectively eliminates a significant number of features while improving PI quality in case of high-dimensional dataset. Finally we extend the SVM models in Conformal Regression setting for obtaining more stable prediction set with finite test set guarantees. Extensive experiments on artificial, real-world benchmark datasets compare the different characteristics of both existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation methods and also highlight the advantages of the feature selection in PI estimation. Furthermore, we compare both, the existing and proposed SVM-based PI estimation models, with modern deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting tasks on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, SVM models show comparable or superior performance to modern complex deep learning models for probabilistic forecasting task in our experiments.'}

However, concerns have also arisen regarding their potential to produce Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and exhibit social biases, hindering their practical use in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, prior work has focused on employing security filters to identify and exclude toxic text, or alternatively, fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models to erase sensitive concepts. Unfortunately, existing methods struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in the sense that they can have a significant impact on the normal model output while still failing to prevent the generation of harmful content in some cases. In this paper, we propose a novel self-discovery approach to identifying a semantic direction vector in the embedding space to restrict text embedding within a safe region. Our method circumvents the need for correcting individual words within the input text and steers the entire text prompt towards a safe region in the embedding space, thereby enhancing model robustness against all possibly unsafe prompts. In addition, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for semantic direction vector initialization to reduce the impact on the model performance for other semantics. Furthermore, our method can also be integrated with existing methods to improve their social responsibility. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method can effectively reduce NSFW content and mitigate social bias generated by diffusion models compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.'}

IKEA first leverages anchor concepts to generate queries with the natural appearance, and then designs two mechanisms to lead to anchor concept thoroughly 'explore' the RAG's privacy knowledge: (1) Experience Reflection Sampling, which samples anchor concepts based on past query-response patterns to ensure the queries' relevance to RAG documents; (2) Trust Region Directed Mutation, which iteratively mutates anchor concepts under similarity constraints to further exploit the embedding space. Extensive experiments demonstrate IKEA's effectiveness under various defenses, surpassing baselines by over 80% in extraction efficiency and 90% in attack success rate.

However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of 1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories, converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency, and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio samples.

While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.'}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Co}ntrastive \\textbf{P}araphrase \\textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts.

To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.'}

Previous studies have demonstrated that SR models can also be subjected to backdoor attacks through data poisoning, affecting downstream tasks. A backdoor SR model generates an attacker-predefined target image when given a triggered image while producing a normal high-resolution (HR) output for clean images. However, prior backdoor attacks on SR models have primarily focused on the stealthiness of poisoned low-resolution (LR) images while ignoring the stealthiness of poisoned HR images, making it easy for users to detect anomalous data. To address this problem, we propose BadSR, which improves the stealthiness of poisoned HR images.

The poisoned HR images generated by BadSR can be integrated with existing triggers.

This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience.

Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead.

To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research."}

We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data.

By removing redundant and irrelevant features, FRFS helps mitigate classifier overfitting, enhance generalization performance, and lessen computational overhead. However, most existing FRFS algorithms primarily focus on reducing uncertainty in pattern classification, neglecting that lower uncertainty does not necessarily result in improved classification performance, despite it commonly being regarded as a key indicator of feature selection effectiveness in the FRFS literature. To bridge uncertainty characterization and pattern classification, we propose a Margin-aware Fuzzy Rough Feature Selection (MAFRFS) framework that considers both the compactness and separation of label classes. MAFRFS effectively reduces uncertainty in pattern classification tasks, while guiding the feature selection towards more separable and discriminative label class structures. Extensive experiments on 15 public datasets demonstrate that MAFRFS is highly scalable and more effective than FRFS. The algorithms developed using MAFRFS outperform six state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.'}

We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision, SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs.

Our paper fills both these gaps by analyzing modern architectures in a data-aware regime: we prove that global optima of deep regularized transformers and residual networks (ResNets) with LayerNorm trained with cross entropy or mean squared error loss are approximately collapsed, and the approximation gets tighter as the depth grows. More generally, we formally reduce any end-to-end large-depth ResNet or transformer training into an equivalent unconstrained features model, thus justifying its wide use in the literature even beyond data-agnostic settings. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments on computer vision and language datasets showing that, as the depth grows, neural collapse indeed becomes more prominent.'}

State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba.

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate visual perception, language grounding, and motion planning within an end-to-end framework, offer a promising alternative by semantically adapting to surgeon prompts without manual recalibration. Despite their potential, applying VLA models to robotic endoscopy presents unique challenges due to the complex and dynamic anatomical environments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To address this, we introduce EndoVLA, designed specifically for continuum robots in GI interventions. Given endoscopic images and surgeon-issued tracking prompts, EndoVLA performs three core tasks: (1) polyp tracking, (2) delineation and following of abnormal mucosal regions, and (3) adherence to circular markers during circumferential cutting. To tackle data scarcity and domain shifts, we propose a dual-phase strategy comprising supervised fine-tuning on our EndoVLA-Motion dataset and reinforcement fine-tuning with task-aware rewards.

This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.\nWhile previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\nWe validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.'}

Furthermore, low-confidence dark knowledge in non-target classes introduces noisy signals that hinder effective knowledge transfer. To address these limitations, we propose DeepKD, a novel training framework that integrates dual-level decoupling with adaptive denoising. First, through theoretical analysis of gradient signal-to-noise ratio (GSNR) characteristics in task-oriented and non-task-oriented knowledge distillation, we design independent momentum updaters for each component to prevent mutual interference. We observe that the optimal momentum coefficients for task-oriented gradient (TOG), target-class gradient (TCG), and non-target-class gradient (NCG) should be positively related to their GSNR. Second, we introduce a dynamic top-k mask (DTM) mechanism that gradually increases K from a small initial value to incorporate more non-target classes as training progresses, following curriculum learning principles.

In medical imaging, VG enhances interpretability by highlighting relevant pathological features corresponding to textual descriptions, improving model transparency and trustworthiness for wider adoption of deep learning models in clinical practice. Current models struggle to associate textual descriptions with disease regions due to inefficient attention mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained token representations. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate two key observations. First, current VLMs assign high norms to background tokens, diverting the model's attention from regions of disease. Second, the global tokens used for cross-modal learning are not representative of local disease tokens. This hampers identifying correlations between the text and disease tokens. To address this, we introduce simple, yet effective Disease-Aware Prompting (DAP) process, which uses the explainability map of a VLM to identify the appropriate image features. This simple strategy amplifies disease-relevant regions while suppressing background interference.

To address these limitations, we propose iterative Proposal-centric autonomous driving (iPad), a novel framework that places proposals - a set of candidate future plans - at the center of feature extraction and auxiliary tasks. Central to iPad is ProFormer, a BEV encoder that iteratively refines proposals and their associated features through proposal-anchored attention, effectively fusing multi-view image data. Additionally, we introduce two lightweight, proposal-centric auxiliary tasks - mapping and prediction - that improve planning quality with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and CARLA Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that iPad achieves state-of-the-art performance while being significantly more efficient than prior leading methods."}

Bickmore', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15108', 'abstract': 'The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Intelligent Virtual Agents acting as psychotherapists presents significant opportunities for expanding mental healthcare access. However, their deployment has also been linked to serious adverse outcomes, including user harm and suicide, facilitated by a lack of standardized evaluation methodologies capable of capturing the nuanced risks of therapeutic interaction. Current evaluation techniques lack the sensitivity to detect subtle changes in patient cognition and behavior during therapy sessions that may lead to subsequent decompensation. We introduce a novel risk taxonomy specifically designed for the systematic evaluation of conversational AI psychotherapists. Developed through an iterative process including review of the psychotherapy risk literature, qualitative interviews with clinical and legal experts, and alignment with established clinical criteria (e.g., DSM-5) and existing assessment tools (e.g., NEQ, UE-ATR), the taxonomy aims to provide a structured approach to identifying and assessing user/patient harms. We provide a high-level overview of this taxonomy, detailing its grounding, and discuss potential use cases. We discuss two use cases in detail: monitoring cognitive model-based risk factors during a counseling conversation to detect unsafe deviations, in both human-AI counseling sessions and in automated benchmarking of AI psychotherapists with simulated patients. The proposed taxonomy offers a foundational step towards establishing safer and more responsible innovation in the domain of AI-driven mental health support.'}

While performance on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency, behavioural metrics provide little information as to why--on a mechanistic level--certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3, Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that Transformers and Based learn to store key-value associations in-context using induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the adoption of mechanistic evaluations.'}

We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations.

Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization.

Towards this goal, prior studies have explored many approaches to combine task knowledge from task-specific data in a (high-resource) source language and language knowledge from unlabeled text in a (low-resource) target language. One notable approach proposed composable sparse fine-tuning (SFT) for cross-lingual transfer that learns task-specific and language-specific sparse masks to select a subset of the pretrained model's parameters that are further fine-tuned. These sparse fine-tuned vectors (SFTs) are subsequently composed with the pretrained model to facilitate zero-shot cross-lingual transfer to a task in a target language, using only task-specific data from a source language. These sparse masks for SFTs were identified using a simple magnitude-based pruning. In our work, we introduce DeFT-X, a novel composable SFT approach that denoises the weight matrices of a pretrained model before magnitude pruning using singular value decomposition, thus yielding more robust SFTs.

By cutting the parts that have little effect on the computation, one can potentially save a significant amount of back-propagation computation in exchange for a minimal increase in the stochastic gradient variance, in some situations. Such a situation occurs in the attention mechanism of the transformer architecture. For long sequences, attention becomes the limiting factor, as its compute requirements increase quadratically with sequence length $n$. At the same time, most attention weights become very small, as most attention heads tend to connect a given token with only a small fraction of other tokens in the sequence. These weights become promising targets for cutting backpropagation. We propose a simple probabilistic rule controlled by a single parameter $c$ that cuts backpropagation through most attention weights, leaving at most $c$ interactions per token per attention head. This brings a factor of $c/n$ reduction in the compute required for the attention backpropagation, turning it from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to linear complexity $O(nc)$. We have empirically verified that, for a typical transformer model, cutting $99\\%$ of the attention gradient flow (i.e. choosing $c \\sim 20-30$) results in relative gradient variance increase of only about $1\\%$ for $n \\sim 2000$, and it decreases with $n$. This approach is amenable to efficient sparse matrix implementation, thus being promising for making the cost of a backward pass negligible relative to the cost of a forward pass when training a transformer model on long sequences.'}

Mapping and monitoring these green spaces are crucial for urban planning and conservation, yet accurately detecting trees is challenging due to complex landscapes and the variability in image resolution caused by different satellite sensors or UAV flight altitudes.

In this work, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates domain adaptation with GANs and Diffusion models to enhance the quality of low-resolution aerial images. Our proposed pipeline enhances low-resolution imagery while preserving semantic content, enabling effective tree segmentation without requiring large volumes of manually annotated data. Leveraging models such as pix2pix, Real-ESRGAN, Latent Diffusion, and Stable Diffusion, we generate realistic and structurally consistent synthetic samples that expand the training dataset and unify scale across domains. This approach not only improves the robustness of segmentation models across different acquisition conditions but also provides a scalable and replicable solution for remote sensing scenarios with scarce annotation resources. Experimental results demonstrated an improvement of over 50% in IoU for low-resolution images, highlighting the effectiveness of our method compared to traditional pipelines.'}

VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images.

Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.'}

Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge.

We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE\'s key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning.

Goldman', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15036', 'abstract': 'As robots are increasingly deployed to collaborate on tasks within shared workspaces and resources, the failure of an individual robot can critically affect the group\'s performance. This issue is particularly challenging when robots lack global information or direct communication, relying instead on social interaction for coordination and to complete their tasks. In this study, we propose a novel fault-tolerance technique leveraging physical contact interactions in multi-robot systems, specifically under conditions of limited sensing and spatial confinement. We introduce the "Active Contact Response" (ACR) method, where each robot modulates its behavior based on the likelihood of encountering an inoperative (faulty) robot. Active robots are capable of collectively repositioning stationary and faulty peers to reduce obstructions and maintain optimal group functionality. We implement our algorithm in a team of autonomous robots, equipped with contact-sensing and collision-tolerance capabilities, tasked with collectively excavating cohesive model pellets. Experimental results indicate that the ACR method significantly improves the system\'s recovery time from robot failures, enabling continued collective excavation with minimal performance degradation. Thus, this work demonstrates the potential of leveraging local, social, and physical interactions to enhance fault tolerance and coordination in multi-robot systems operating in constrained and extreme environments.'}

Boning, Dina Katabi', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15034', 'abstract': 'Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: this https URL.'}

Unlike low-density collectives like bird flocks and insect swarms, in which hydrodynamic and statistical phenomena dominate, the physics of glasses and supercooled fluids is important to understand clogging behaviors in high-density collectives. Our previous work revealed that fire ants flowing in confined tunnels utilize diverse behaviors like unequal workload distributions, spontaneous direction reversals, and limited interaction times to mitigate clogging and jamming and thus maintain functional flow; implementation of similar rules in a small robophysical swarm led to high performance through spontaneous dissolution of clogs and clusters. However, how the insects learn such behaviors, and how we can develop "task capable" active matter in such regimes, remains a challenge in part because interaction dynamics are dominated by local, time-consuming collisions and no single agent can guide the entire collective. Here, we hypothesized that effective flow and clog mitigation could emerge purely through local learning. We tasked small groups of robots with pellet excavation in a narrow tunnel, allowing them to modify reversal probabilities over time. Initially, robots had equal probabilities and clogs were common. Reversals improved flow. When reversal probabilities adapted via collisions and noisy tunnel length estimates, workload inequality and performance improved. Our robophysical study of an excavating swarm shows that, despite the seeming complexity and difficulty of the task, simple learning rules can mitigate or leverage unavoidable features in task-capable dense active matter, leading to hypotheses for dense biological and robotic swarms.'}

Palacio', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15023', 'abstract': "This dissertation addresses achieving causal interpretability in Deep Learning for Software Engineering (DL4SE). While Neural Code Models (NCMs) show strong performance in automating software tasks, their lack of transparency in causal relationships between inputs and outputs limits full understanding of their capabilities. To build trust in NCMs, researchers and practitioners must explain code predictions. Associational interpretability, which identifies correlations, is often insufficient for tasks requiring intervention and change analysis. To address this, the dissertation introduces DoCode, a novel post hoc interpretability method for NCMs. DoCode uses causal inference to provide programming language-oriented explanations of model predictions. It follows a four-step pipeline: modeling causal problems using Structural Causal Models (SCMs), identifying the causal estimand, estimating effects with metrics like Average Treatment Effect (ATE), and refuting effect estimates. Its framework is extensible, with an example that reduces spurious correlations by grounding explanations in programming language properties. A case study on deep code generation across interpretability scenarios and various deep learning architectures demonstrates DoCode's benefits. Results show NCMs' sensitivity to code syntax changes and their ability to learn certain programming concepts while minimizing confounding bias. The dissertation also examines associational interpretability as a foundation, analyzing software information's causal nature using tools like COMET and TraceXplainer for traceability. It highlights the need to identify code confounders and offers practical guidelines for applying causal interpretability to NCMs, contributing to more trustworthy AI in software engineering."}

Our work addresses these gaps by showing that there exists a class of one-layer transformers that are provably Bayes-optimal with both linear and ReLU attention.

A central focus of our work is the setting of covariate shift, where the input distribution at test time differs from that at training. This realistic and challenging scenario remains relatively underexplored in the context of selective classification. We evaluate our proposed methods across a range of vision and language tasks, including both supervised learning and vision-language models.

We extend this framework to partial languages with features such as potentially non-terminating operations, real-valued conditionals, and iteration constructs like while-loops, while preserving CHAD's structure-preserving semantics principle. A key contribution is the introduction of iteration-extensive indexed categories, which allow iteration in the base category to lift to parameterized initial algebras in the indexed category. This enables iteration to be interpreted in the Grothendieck construction of the target language in a principled way. The resulting fibred iterative structure cleanly models iteration in the categorical semantics. Consequently, the extended CHAD transformation remains the unique structure-preserving functor (an iterative Freyd category morphism) from the freely generated iterative Freyd category of the source language to the Grothendieck construction of the target's syntactic semantics, mapping each primitive operation to its derivative. We prove the correctness of this transformation using the universal property of the source language's syntax, showing that the transformed programs compute correct reverse-mode derivatives. Our development also contributes to understanding iteration constructs within dependently typed languages and categories of containers. As our primary motivation and application, we generalize CHAD to languages with data types, partial features, and iteration, providing the first rigorous categorical semantics for reverse-mode CHAD in such settings and formally guaranteeing the correctness of the source-to-source CHAD technique."}

EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH).

Critically, it enables dynamic agent composition and problem decomposition through meta-feedback on solvability and completeness. Experiments across math, graduate-level QA, and software engineering benchmarks, using both closed-source and open-source LLM back-bones of varying sizes, demonstrate that SELF-MAS outperforms both manual and automatic MAS baselines, achieving a 7.44% average accuracy improvement over the next strongest baseline while maintaining cost-efficiency.

The presence of sensitive information, particularly Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers, introduces serious privacy and re-identification risks, discouraging the publishing and sharing of real-world logs. In practice, log anonymization techniques primarily rely on regular expression patterns, which involve manually crafting rules to identify and replace sensitive information.

To mitigate these limitations, we introduce SDLog, a deep learning-based framework designed to identify sensitive information in software logs.

However, scaling GCRL to longer horizons remains challenging due to the combination of sparse rewards and discounting, which obscures the comparative advantages of primitive actions with respect to distant goals. Hierarchical RL methods achieve strong empirical results on long-horizon goal-reaching tasks, but their reliance on modular, timescale-specific policies and subgoal generation introduces significant additional complexity and hinders scaling to high-dimensional goal spaces. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to train a flat (non-hierarchical) goal-conditioned policy by bootstrapping on subgoal-conditioned policies with advantage-weighted importance sampling. Our approach eliminates the need for a generative model over the (sub)goal space, which we find is key for scaling to high-dimensional control in large state spaces. We further show that existing hierarchical and bootstrapping-based approaches correspond to specific design choices within our derivation.

Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \\(2.2\\times\\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \\& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy.

Eshraghian, Omid Kavehei', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14841', 'abstract': "Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity. This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks, resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain."}

However, in these approaches: the chosen model architectures were rudimentary, feed-forward neural networks giving limited accuracy; the studies focus on predicting elastic mechanical properties, without considering material strength limits; and the models lacked transparency, hindering trustworthiness by users.

However, their deployment is often limited by significant inference latency, primarily due to the inherently sequential nature of the denoising process.

To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{ParaStep}, a novel parallelization method based on a reuse-then-predict mechanism that parallelizes diffusion inference by exploiting similarity between adjacent denoising steps. Unlike prior approaches that rely on layer-wise or stage-wise communication, ParaStep employs lightweight, step-wise communication, substantially reducing overhead. ParaStep achieves end-to-end speedups of up to \\textbf{3.88}$\\times$ on SVD, \\textbf{2.43}$\\times$ on CogVideoX-2b, and \\textbf{6.56}$\\times$ on AudioLDM2-large, while maintaining generation quality.

The training process of such a model is controlled by a loss function which measures the difference between the noise that was added in the forward process and the noise that was predicted by the diffusion model. This enables the generation of realistic data. However, the randomness within the process and the loss function itself makes it difficult to estimate the quality of the data. Therefore, we examine multiple similarity metrics and adapt an existing metric to overcome this issue by monitoring the training and synthetisation process using those metrics. The adapted metric can even be fine-tuned on the input data to comply with the requirements of an underlying classification task. We were able to significantly reduce the amount of training epochs without a performance reduction in the classification task. An optimized training process not only saves resources, but also reduces the time for training generative models.'}

Recent advances in Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN) have achieved great progress in modelling spatial-temporal correlations. Limited by computational complexity, most STGNNs for MTS forecasting focus primarily on short-term and local spatial-temporal dependencies. Although some recent methods attempt to incorporate univariate history into modeling, they still overlook crucial long-term spatial-temporal similarities and correlations across MTS, which are essential for accurate forecasting. To fill this gap, we propose a framework called the Long-term Multivariate History Representation (LMHR) Enhanced STGNN for MTS forecasting. Specifically, a Long-term History Encoder (LHEncoder) is adopted to effectively encode the long-term history into segment-level contextual representations and reduce point-level noise. A non-parametric Hierarchical Representation Retriever (HRetriever) is designed to include the spatial information in the long-term spatial-temporal dependency modelling and pick out the most valuable representations with no additional training. A Transformer-based Aggregator (TAggregator) selectively fuses the sparsely retrieved contextual representations based on the ranking positional embedding efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that LMHR outperforms typical STGNNs by 10.72% on the average prediction horizons and state-of-the-art methods by 4.12% on several real-world datasets. Additionally, it consistently improves prediction accuracy by 9.8% on the top 10% of rapidly changing patterns across the datasets.'}

Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall.

Reader discretion is advised. Recently, vision-language models have demonstrated increasing influence in morally sensitive domains such as autonomous driving and medical analysis, owing to their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. As these models are deployed in high-stakes real-world applications, it is of paramount importance to ensure that their outputs align with human moral values and remain within moral boundaries. However, existing work on moral alignment either focuses solely on textual modalities or relies heavily on AI-generated images, leading to distributional biases and reduced realism. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MORALISE, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the moral alignment of vision-language models (VLMs) using diverse, expert-verified real-world data. We begin by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of 13 moral topics grounded in Turiel's Domain Theory, spanning the personal, interpersonal, and societal moral domains encountered in everyday life. Built on this framework, we manually curate 2,481 high-quality image-text pairs, each annotated with two fine-grained labels: (1) topic annotation, identifying the violated moral topic(s), and (2) modality annotation, indicating whether the violation arises from the image or the text. For evaluation, we encompass two tasks, \\textit{moral judgment} and \\textit{moral norm attribution}, to assess models' awareness of moral violations and their reasoning ability on morally salient content. Extensive experiments on 19 popular open- and closed-source VLMs show that MORALISE poses a significant challenge, revealing persistent moral limitations in current state-of-the-art models.

In this project, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning the BLIP model on the ROCO dataset for improved radiology captioning. We compare the fine-tuned BLIP against its zero-shot version, BLIP-2 base, BLIP-2 Instruct and a ViT-GPT2 transformer baseline. Our results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning on BLIP significantly improves performance across both quantitative and qualitative evaluation metrics. We also visualize decoder cross-attention maps to assess interpretability and conduct an ablation study to evaluate the contributions of encoder-only and decoder-only fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the importance of targeted adaptation for medical applications and suggest that decoder-only fine-tuning (encoder-frozen) offers a strong performance baseline with 5% lower training time than full fine-tuning, while full model fine-tuning still yields the best results overall.'}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection.

In this paper, we propose OBPV (Off-Ball Positioning Value) to evaluate space across the pitch, including the starting points of transitions. OBPV extends OBSO by introducing the field value model, which evaluates the entire pitch, and by employing the transition kernel model, which reflects positional specificity through kernel density estimation of pass distributions.

However, their computational cost remains a major bottleneck-attention alone accounts for over 80% of total latency, and generating just 8 seconds of 720p video takes tens of minutes-posing serious challenges to practical application and scalability. To address this, we propose the DraftAttention, a training-free framework for the acceleration of video diffusion transformers with dynamic sparse attention on GPUs. We apply down-sampling to each feature map across frames in the compressed latent space, enabling a higher-level receptive field over the latent composed of hundreds of thousands of tokens. The low-resolution draft attention map, derived from draft query and key, exposes redundancy both spatially within each feature map and temporally across frames. We reorder the query, key, and value based on the draft attention map to guide the sparse attention computation in full resolution, and subsequently restore their original order after the attention computation. This reordering enables structured sparsity that aligns with hardware-optimized execution. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the low-resolution draft attention closely approximates the full attention, providing reliable guidance for constructing accurate sparse attention. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing sparse attention approaches in video generation quality and achieves up to 1.75x end-to-end speedup on GPUs. Code: this https URL'}

Thus, the challenge of identifying such subtle differences in a wide range of taxa remains unaddressed.
