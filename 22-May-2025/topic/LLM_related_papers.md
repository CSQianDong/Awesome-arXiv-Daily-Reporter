**Authors**: Zhen Zhang, Xuehai He, Weixiang Yan, Ao Shen, Chenyang Zhao, Shuohang Wang, Yelong Shen, Xin Eric Wang

**Abstract**: Human cognition typically involves thinking through abstract, fluid concepts rather than strictly using discrete linguistic tokens. Current reasoning models, however, are constrained to reasoning within the boundaries of human language, processing discrete token embeddings that represent fixed points in the semantic space. This discrete constraint restricts the expressive power and upper potential of such reasoning models, often causing incomplete exploration of reasoning paths, as standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods rely on sampling one token per step. In this work, we introduce Soft Thinking, a training-free method that emulates human-like "soft" reasoning by generating soft, abstract concept tokens in a continuous concept space. These concept tokens are created by the probability-weighted mixture of token embeddings, which form the continuous concept space, enabling smooth transitions and richer representations that transcend traditional discrete boundaries. In essence, each generated concept token encapsulates multiple meanings from related discrete tokens, implicitly exploring various reasoning paths to converge effectively toward the correct answer. Empirical evaluations on diverse mathematical and coding benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Soft Thinking, improving pass@1 accuracy by up to 2.48 points while simultaneously reducing token usage by up to 22.4% compared to standard CoT. Qualitative analysis further reveals that Soft Thinking outputs remain highly interpretable and readable, highlighting the potential of Soft Thinking to break the inherent bottleneck of discrete language-based reasoning.

# Reverse Engineering Human Preferences with Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Lisa Alazraki, Tan Yi-Chern, Jon Ander Campos, Maximilian Mozes, Marek Rei, Max Bartolo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15795)  

**Abstract**: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are routinely evaluated by other LLMs trained to predict human preferences. This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks.

# Learning to Reason via Mixture-of-Thought for Logical Reasoning 

**Authors**: Tong Zheng, Lichang Chen, Simeng Han, R. Thomas McCoy, Heng Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15817)  

**Abstract**: Human beings naturally utilize multiple reasoning modalities to learn and solve logical problems, i.e., different representational formats such as natural language, code, and symbolic logic. In contrast, most existing LLM-based approaches operate with a single reasoning modality during training, typically natural language. Although some methods explored modality selection or augmentation at inference time, the training process remains modality-blind, limiting synergy among modalities. To fill in this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Thought (MoT), a framework that enables LLMs to reason across three complementary modalities: natural language, code, and a newly introduced symbolic modality, truth-table, which systematically enumerates logical cases and partially mitigates key failure modes in natural language reasoning. MoT adopts a two-phase design: (1) self-evolving MoT training, which jointly learns from filtered, self-generated rationales across modalities; and (2) MoT inference, which fully leverages the synergy of three modalities to produce better predictions. Experiments on logical reasoning benchmarks including FOLIO and ProofWriter demonstrate that our MoT framework consistently and significantly outperforms strong LLM baselines with single-modality chain-of-thought approaches, achieving up to +11.7pp average accuracy gain. Further analyses show that our MoT framework benefits both training and inference stages; that it is particularly effective on harder logical reasoning problems; and that different modalities contribute complementary strengths, with truth-table reasoning helping to overcome key bottlenecks in natural language inference.

# Beyond Empathy: Integrating Diagnostic and Therapeutic Reasoning with Large Language Models for Mental Health Counseling 

**Authors**: He Hu, Yucheng Zhou, Juzheng Si, Qianning Wang, Hengheng Zhang, Fuji Ren, Fei Ma, Laizhong Cui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15715)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) hold significant potential for mental health support, capable of generating empathetic responses and simulating therapeutic conversations. However, existing LLM-based approaches often lack the clinical grounding necessary for real-world psychological counseling, particularly in explicit diagnostic reasoning aligned with standards like the DSM/ICD and incorporating diverse therapeutic modalities beyond basic empathy or single strategies. To address these critical limitations, we propose PsyLLM, the first large language model designed to systematically integrate both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning for mental health counseling. To develop the PsyLLM, we propose a novel automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline processes real-world mental health posts, generates multi-turn dialogue structures, and leverages LLMs guided by international diagnostic standards (e.g., DSM/ICD) and multiple therapeutic frameworks (e.g., CBT, ACT, psychodynamic) to simulate detailed clinical reasoning processes. Rigorous multi-dimensional filtering ensures the generation of high-quality, clinically aligned dialogue data. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark and evaluation protocol, assessing counseling quality across four key dimensions: comprehensiveness, professionalism, authenticity, and safety. Our experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on this benchmark.

# DEBATE, TRAIN, EVOLVE: Self Evolution of Language Model Reasoning 

**Authors**: Gaurav Srivastava, Zhenyu Bi, Meng Lu, Xuan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15734)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities.

# VocalBench: Benchmarking the Vocal Conversational Abilities for Speech Interaction Models 

**Authors**: Heyang Liu, Yuhao Wang, Ziyang Cheng, Ronghua Wu, Qunshan Gu, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15727)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of multi-modal models capable of vocal communication. Unlike text-based interactions, speech conveys rich and diverse information, including semantic content, acoustic variations, paralanguage cues, and environmental context. However, existing evaluations of speech interaction models predominantly focus on the quality of their textual responses, often overlooking critical aspects of vocal performance and lacking benchmarks with vocal-specific test instances. To address this gap, we propose VocalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate speech interaction models' capabilities in vocal communication. VocalBench comprises 9,400 carefully curated instances across four key dimensions: semantic quality, acoustic performance, conversational abilities, and robustness. It covers 16 fundamental skills essential for effective vocal interaction. Experimental results reveal significant variability in current model capabilities, each exhibiting distinct strengths and weaknesses, and provide valuable insights to guide future research in speech-based interaction systems. Code and evaluation instances are available at this https URL.

# Shared Path: Unraveling Memorization in Multilingual LLMs through Language Similarities 

**Authors**: Xiaoyu Luo, Yiyi Chen, Johannes Bjerva, Qiongxiu Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15722)  

**Abstract**: We present the first comprehensive study of Memorization in Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs), analyzing 95 languages using models across diverse model scales, architectures, and memorization definitions. As MLLMs are increasingly deployed, understanding their memorization behavior has become critical. Yet prior work has focused primarily on monolingual models, leaving multilingual memorization underexplored, despite the inherently long-tailed nature of training corpora. We find that the prevailing assumption, that memorization is highly correlated with training data availability, fails to fully explain memorization patterns in MLLMs. We hypothesize that treating languages in isolation - ignoring their similarities - obscures the true patterns of memorization. To address this, we propose a novel graph-based correlation metric that incorporates language similarity to analyze cross-lingual memorization. Our analysis reveals that among similar languages, those with fewer training tokens tend to exhibit higher memorization, a trend that only emerges when cross-lingual relationships are explicitly modeled. These findings underscore the importance of a language-aware perspective in evaluating and mitigating memorization vulnerabilities in MLLMs. This also constitutes empirical evidence that language similarity both explains Memorization in MLLMs and underpins Cross-lingual Transferability, with broad implications for multilingual NLP.

# Advancing LLM Safe Alignment with Safety Representation Ranking 

**Authors**: Tianqi Du, Zeming Wei, Quan Chen, Chenheng Zhang, Yisen Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15710)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated milestone success in a variety of tasks, yet their potential for generating harmful content has raised significant safety concerns. Existing safety evaluation approaches typically operate directly on textual responses, overlooking the rich information embedded in the model's internal representations. In this paper, we propose Safety Representation Ranking (SRR), a listwise ranking framework that selects safe responses using hidden states from the LLM itself. SRR encodes both instructions and candidate completions using intermediate transformer representations and ranks candidates via a lightweight similarity-based scorer. Our approach directly leverages internal model states and supervision at the list level to capture subtle safety signals. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that SRR significantly improves robustness to adversarial prompts. Our code will be available upon publication.

# TurnaboutLLM: A Deductive Reasoning Benchmark from Detective Games 

**Authors**: Yuan Yuan, Muyu He, Muhammad Adil Shahid, Jiani Huang, Ziyang Li, Li Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15712)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces TurnaboutLLM, a novel framework and dataset for evaluating the deductive reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging the interactive gameplay of detective games Ace Attorney and Danganronpa. The framework tasks LLMs with identifying contradictions between testimonies and evidences within long narrative contexts, a challenging task due to the large answer space and diverse reasoning types presented by its questions. We evaluate twelve state-of-the-art LLMs on the dataset, hinting at limitations of popular strategies for enhancing deductive reasoning such as extensive thinking and Chain-of-Thought prompting. The results also suggest varying effects of context size, the number of reasoning step and answer space size on model performance. Overall, TurnaboutLLM presents a substantial challenge for LLMs' deductive reasoning abilities in complex, narrative-rich environments.

# Keep Security! Benchmarking Security Policy Preservation in Large Language Model Contexts Against Indirect Attacks in Question Answering 

**Authors**: Hwan Chang, Yumin Kim, Yonghyun Jun, Hwanhee Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15805)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains such as enterprise and government, ensuring that they adhere to user-defined security policies within context is critical-especially with respect to information non-disclosure. While prior LLM studies have focused on general safety and socially sensitive data, large-scale benchmarks for contextual security preservation against attacks remain lacking. To address this, we introduce a novel large-scale benchmark dataset, CoPriva, evaluating LLM adherence to contextual non-disclosure policies in question answering. Derived from realistic contexts, our dataset includes explicit policies and queries designed as direct and challenging indirect attacks seeking prohibited information. We evaluate 10 LLMs on our benchmark and reveal a significant vulnerability: many models violate user-defined policies and leak sensitive information. This failure is particularly severe against indirect attacks, highlighting a critical gap in current LLM safety alignment for sensitive applications. Our analysis reveals that while models can often identify the correct answer to a query, they struggle to incorporate policy constraints during generation. In contrast, they exhibit a partial ability to revise outputs when explicitly prompted. Our findings underscore the urgent need for more robust methods to guarantee contextual security.

# ThinkLess: A Training-Free Inference-Efficient Method for Reducing Reasoning Redundancy 

**Authors**: Gengyang Li, Yifeng Gao, Yuming Li, Yunfang Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15684)  

**Abstract**: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs), the excessive length of reasoning tokens increases latency and KV cache memory usage, and may even truncate final answers under context limits. We propose ThinkLess, an inference-efficient framework that terminates reasoning generation early and maintains output quality without modifying the model. Atttention analysis reveals that answer tokens focus minimally on earlier reasoning steps and primarily attend to the reasoning terminator token, due to information migration under causal masking. Building on this insight, ThinkLess inserts the terminator token at earlier positions to skip redundant reasoning while preserving the underlying knowledge transfer. To prevent format discruption casued by early termination, ThinkLess employs a lightweight post-regulation mechanism, relying on the model's natural instruction-following ability to produce well-structured answers. Without fine-tuning or auxiliary data, ThinkLess achieves comparable accuracy to full-length CoT decoding while greatly reducing decoding time and memory consumption.

# Beyond Hard and Soft: Hybrid Context Compression for Balancing Local and Global Information Retention 

**Authors**: Huanxuan Liao, Wen Hu, Yao Xu, Shizhu He, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15774)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant challenges in long-sequence inference due to computational inefficiency and redundant processing, driving interest in context compression techniques. Existing methods often rely on token importance to perform hard local compression or encode context into latent representations for soft global compression. However, the uneven distribution of textual content relevance and the diversity of demands for user instructions mean these approaches frequently lead to the loss of potentially valuable information. To address this, we propose $\textbf{Hy}$brid $\textbf{Co}$ntext $\textbf{Co}$mpression (HyCo$_2$) for LLMs, which integrates both global and local perspectives to guide context compression while retaining both the essential semantics and critical details for task completion. Specifically, we employ a hybrid adapter to refine global semantics with the global view, based on the observation that different adapters excel at different tasks. Then we incorporate a classification layer that assigns a retention probability to each context token based on the local view, determining whether it should be retained or discarded. To foster a balanced integration of global and local compression, we introduce auxiliary paraphrasing and completion pretraining before instruction tuning. This promotes a synergistic integration that emphasizes instruction-relevant information while preserving essential local details, ultimately balancing local and global information retention in context compression. Experiments show that our HyCo$_2$ method significantly enhances long-text reasoning while reducing token usage. It improves the performance of various LLM series by an average of 13.1\% across seven knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks. Moreover, HyCo$_2$ matches the performance of uncompressed methods while reducing token consumption by 88.8\%.

# Can Large Language Models be Effective Online Opinion Miners? 

**Authors**: Ryang Heo, Yongsik Seo, Junseong Lee, Dongha Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15695)  

**Abstract**: The surge of user-generated online content presents a wealth of insights into customer preferences and market trends. However, the highly diverse, complex, and context-rich nature of such contents poses significant challenges to traditional opinion mining approaches. To address this, we introduce Online Opinion Mining Benchmark (OOMB), a novel dataset and evaluation protocol designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to mine opinions effectively from diverse and intricate online environments. OOMB provides extensive (entity, feature, opinion) tuple annotations and a comprehensive opinion-centric summary that highlights key opinion topics within each content, thereby enabling the evaluation of both the extractive and abstractive capabilities of models. Through our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of which aspects remain challenging and where LLMs exhibit adaptability, to explore whether they can effectively serve as opinion miners in realistic online scenarios. This study lays the foundation for LLM-based opinion mining and discusses directions for future research in this field.

# Feature Extraction and Steering for Enhanced Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Language Models 

**Authors**: Zihao Li, Xu Wang, Yuzhe Yang, Ziyu Yao, Haoyi Xiong, Mengnan Du  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15634)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate the ability to solve reasoning and mathematical problems using the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique. Expanding CoT length, as seen in models such as DeepSeek-R1, significantly enhances this reasoning for complex problems, but requires costly and high-quality long CoT data and fine-tuning. This work, inspired by the deep thinking paradigm of DeepSeek-R1, utilizes a steering technique to enhance the reasoning ability of an LLM without external datasets. Our method first employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from vanilla CoT. These features are then used to steer the LLM's internal states during generation. Recognizing that many LLMs do not have corresponding pre-trained SAEs, we further introduce a novel SAE-free steering algorithm, which directly computes steering directions from the residual activations of an LLM, obviating the need for an explicit SAE. Experimental results demonstrate that both our SAE-based and subsequent SAE-free steering algorithms significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

# Can LLMs $\textit{understand}$ Math? -- Exploring the Pitfalls in Mathematical Reasoning 

**Authors**: Tiasa Singha Roy, Aditeya Baral, Ayush Rajesh Jhaveri, Yusuf Baig  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15623)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable potential in various natural language tasks but face significant challenges in mathematical reasoning, particularly in executing precise, multi-step logic. However, current evaluation frameworks judge their performance solely based on accuracy, which only accounts for the final answer. This study explores these pitfalls by employing a novel evaluation framework. We propose an evaluation metric called the MAPLE score, which holistically quantifies reasoning misalignment by integrating error rates, redundancy, and validity.

# Long-Form Information Alignment Evaluation Beyond Atomic Facts 

**Authors**: Danna Zheng, Mirella Lapata, Jeff Z. Pan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15792)  

**Abstract**: Information alignment evaluators are vital for various NLG evaluation tasks and trustworthy LLM deployment, reducing hallucinations and enhancing user trust. Current fine-grained methods, like FactScore, verify facts individually but neglect inter-fact dependencies, enabling subtle vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce MontageLie, a challenging benchmark that constructs deceptive narratives by "montaging" truthful statements without introducing explicit hallucinations. We demonstrate that both coarse-grained LLM-based evaluators and current fine-grained frameworks are susceptible to this attack, with AUC-ROC scores falling below 65%. To enable more robust fine-grained evaluation, we propose DoveScore, a novel framework that jointly verifies factual accuracy and event-order consistency. By modeling inter-fact relationships, DoveScore outperforms existing fine-grained methods by over 8%, providing a more robust solution for long-form text alignment evaluation. Our code and datasets are available at this https URL.

# Do RAG Systems Suffer From Positional Bias? 

**Authors**: Florin Cuconasu, Simone Filice, Guy Horowitz, Yoelle Maarek, Fabrizio Silvestri  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15561)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.

# DayDreamer at CQs-Gen 2025: Generating Critical Questions through Argument Scheme Completion 

**Authors**: Wendi Zhou, Ameer Saadat-Yazdi, Nadin Kökciyan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15554)  

**Abstract**: Critical questions are essential resources to provoke critical thinking when encountering an argumentative text. We present our system for the Critical Questions Generation (CQs-Gen) Shared Task at ArgMining 2025. Our approach leverages large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought prompting to generate critical questions guided by Walton's argumentation schemes. For each input intervention, we conversationally prompt LLMs to instantiate the corresponding argument scheme template to first obtain structured arguments, and then generate relevant critical questions. Following this, we rank all the available critical questions by prompting LLMs to select the top 3 most helpful questions based on the original intervention text. This combination of structured argumentation theory and step-by-step reasoning enables the generation of contextually relevant and diverse critical questions. Our pipeline achieves competitive performance in the final test set, showing its potential to foster critical thinking given argumentative text and detect missing or uninformed claims.

# Listen to the Context: Towards Faithful Large Language Models for Retrieval Augmented Generation on Climate Questions 

**Authors**: David Thulke, Jakob Kemmler, Christian Dugast, Hermann Ney  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15633)  

**Abstract**: Large language models that use retrieval augmented generation have the potential to unlock valuable knowledge for researchers, policymakers, and the public by making long and technical climate-related documents more accessible. While this approach can help alleviate factual hallucinations by relying on retrieved passages as additional context, its effectiveness depends on whether the model's output remains faithful to these passages. To address this, we explore the automatic assessment of faithfulness of different models in this setting. We then focus on ClimateGPT, a large language model specialised in climate science, to examine which factors in its instruction fine-tuning impact the model's faithfulness. By excluding unfaithful subsets of the model's training data, we develop ClimateGPT Faithful+, which achieves an improvement in faithfulness from 30% to 57% in supported atomic claims according to our automatic metric.

# Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs 

**Authors**: Lang Gao, Kaiyang Wan, Wei Liu, Chenxi Wang, Zirui Song, Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Veselin Stoyanov, Xiuying Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15524)  

**Abstract**: Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g., "positive" and "negative"), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For instance, the understanding of "food" should not skew toward any particular sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r > 0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and transparency in LLMs.

# Multilingual Test-Time Scaling via Initial Thought Transfer 

**Authors**: Prasoon Bajpai, Tanmoy Chakraborty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15508)  

**Abstract**: Test-time scaling has emerged as a widely adopted inference-time strategy for boosting reasoning performance. However, its effectiveness has been studied almost exclusively in English, leaving its behavior in other languages largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of test-time scaling in multilingual settings, evaluating DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLama-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B across both high- and low-resource Latin-script languages. Our findings reveal that the relative gains from test-time scaling vary significantly across languages. Additionally, models frequently switch to English mid-reasoning, even when operating under strictly monolingual prompts. We further show that low-resource languages not only produce initial reasoning thoughts that differ significantly from English but also have lower internal consistency across generations in their early reasoning. Building on our findings, we introduce MITT (Multilingual Initial Thought Transfer), an unsupervised and lightweight reasoning prefix-tuning approach that transfers high-resource reasoning prefixes to enhance test-time scaling across all languages, addressing inconsistencies in multilingual reasoning performance. MITT significantly boosts DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B's reasoning performance, especially for underrepresented languages.

# From Problem-Solving to Teaching Problem-Solving: Aligning LLMs with Pedagogy using Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: David Dinucu-Jianu, Jakub Macina, Nico Daheim, Ido Hakimi, Iryna Gurevych, Mrinmaya Sachan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15607)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model's instructional planning.

# KaFT: Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning for Boosting LLMs' Domain-specific Question-Answering Performance 

**Authors**: Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Xiantao Cai, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15480)  

**Abstract**: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a common approach to improve the domain-specific question-answering (QA) performance of large language models (LLMs). However, recent literature reveals that due to the conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and the context knowledge of training data, vanilla SFT using the full QA training set is usually suboptimal. In this paper, we first design a query diversification strategy for robust conflict detection and then conduct a series of experiments to analyze the impact of knowledge conflict. We find that 1) training samples with varied conflicts contribute differently, where SFT on the data with large conflicts leads to catastrophic performance drops; 2) compared to directly filtering out the conflict data, appropriately applying the conflict data would be more beneficial. Motivated by this, we propose a simple-yet-effective Knowledge-aware Fine-tuning (namely KaFT) approach to effectively boost LLMs' performance. The core of KaFT is to adapt the training weight by assigning different rewards for different training samples according to conflict level. Extensive experiments show that KaFT brings consistent and significant improvements across four LLMs. More analyses prove that KaFT effectively improves the model generalization and alleviates the hallucination.

# LFTF: Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning for Mitigating Gender Bias in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Zhanyue Qin, Yue Ding, Deyuan Liu, Qingbin Liu, Junxian Cai, Xi Chen, Zhiying Tu, Dianhui Chu, Cuiyun Gao, Dianbo Sui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15475)  

**Abstract**: Nowadays, Large Language Models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention due to their powerful performance. However, due to the unavoidable exposure to socially biased data during training, LLMs tend to exhibit social biases, particularly gender bias. To better explore and quantifying the degree of gender bias in LLMs, we propose a pair of datasets named GenBiasEval and GenHintEval, respectively. The GenBiasEval is responsible for evaluating the degree of gender bias in LLMs, accompanied by an evaluation metric named AFGB-Score (Absolutely Fair Gender Bias Score). Meanwhile, the GenHintEval is used to assess whether LLMs can provide responses consistent with prompts that contain gender hints, along with the accompanying evaluation metric UB-Score (UnBias Score). Besides, in order to mitigate gender bias in LLMs more effectively, we present the LFTF (Locating First and Then Fine-Tuning) this http URL algorithm first ranks specific LLM blocks by their relevance to gender bias in descending order using a metric called BMI (Block Mitigating Importance Score). Based on this ranking, the block most strongly associated with gender bias is then fine-tuned using a carefully designed loss function. Numerous experiments have shown that our proposed LFTF algorithm can significantly mitigate gender bias in LLMs while maintaining their general capabilities.

# Teaching Language Models to Evolve with Users: Dynamic Profile Modeling for Personalized Alignment 

**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Xingyu Sui, Yulin Hu, Jiahe Guo, Haixiao Liu, Biye Li, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Ting Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15456)  

**Abstract**: Personalized alignment is essential for enabling large language models (LLMs) to engage effectively in user-centric dialogue. While recent prompt-based and offline optimization methods offer preliminary solutions, they fall short in cold-start scenarios and long-term personalization due to their inherently static and shallow designs. In this work, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Alignment (RLPA) framework, in which an LLM interacts with a simulated user model to iteratively infer and refine user profiles through dialogue. The training process is guided by a dual-level reward structure: the Profile Reward encourages accurate construction of user representations, while the Response Reward incentivizes generation of responses consistent with the inferred profile. We instantiate RLPA by fine-tuning Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, resulting in Qwen-RLPA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in personalized dialogue. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Qwen-RLPA consistently outperforms prompting and offline fine-tuning baselines, and even surpasses advanced commercial models such as Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o. Further analysis highlights Qwen-RLPA's robustness in reconciling conflicting user preferences, sustaining long-term personalization and delivering more efficient inference compared to recent reasoning-focused LLMs. These results emphasize the potential of dynamic profile inference as a more effective paradigm for building personalized dialogue systems.

# Learn to Reason Efficiently with Adaptive Length-based Reward Shaping 

**Authors**: Wei Liu, Ruochen Zhou, Yiyun Deng, Yuzhen Huang, Junteng Liu, Yuntian Deng, Yizhe Zhang, Junxian He

**Abstract**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex problems through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly by generating long reasoning traces. However, these extended outputs often exhibit substantial redundancy, which limits the efficiency of LRMs. In this paper, we investigate RL-based approaches to promote reasoning efficiency. Specifically, we first present a unified framework that formulates various efficient reasoning methods through the lens of length-based reward shaping. Building on this perspective, we propose a novel Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping method (LASER), which employs a step function as the reward, controlled by a target length. LASER surpasses previous methods, achieving a superior Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. Next, we further extend LASER based on two key intuitions: (1) The reasoning behavior of the model evolves during training, necessitating reward specifications that are also adaptive and dynamic; (2) Rather than uniformly encouraging shorter or longer chains of thought (CoT), we posit that length-based reward shaping should be difficulty-aware i.e., it should penalize lengthy CoTs more for easy queries. This approach is expected to facilitate a combination of fast and slow thinking, leading to a better overall tradeoff. The resulting method is termed LASER-D (Dynamic and Difficulty-aware). Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B show that our approach significantly enhances both reasoning performance and response length efficiency. For instance, LASER-D and its variant achieve a +6.1 improvement on AIME2024 while reducing token usage by 63%. Further analysis reveals our RL-based compression produces more concise reasoning patterns with less redundant "self-reflections". Resources are at this https URL.

**Authors**: Ao Liu, Botong Zhou, Can Xu, Chayse Zhou, ChenChen Zhang, Chengcheng Xu, Chenhao Wang, Decheng Wu, Dengpeng Wu, Dian Jiao, Dong Du, Dong Wang, Feng Zhang, Fengzong Lian, Guanghui Xu, Guanwei Zhang, Hai Wang, Haipeng Luo, Han Hu, Huilin Xu, Jiajia Wu, Jianchen Zhu, Jianfeng Yan, Jiaqi Zhu, Jihong Zhang, Jinbao Xue, Jun Xia, Junqiang Zheng, Kai Liu, Kai Zhang, Kai Zheng, Kejiao Li, Keyao Wang, Lan Jiang, Lixin Liu, Lulu Wu, Mengyuan Huang, Peijie Yu, Peiqi Wang, Qian Wang, Qianbiao Xiang, Qibin Liu, Qingfeng Sun, Richard Guo, Ruobing Xie, Saiyong Yang, Shaohua Chen, Shihui Hu, Shuai Li, Shuaipeng Li, Shuang Chen, Suncong Zheng, Tao Yang, Tian Zhang, Tinghao Yu, Weidong Han, Weijie Liu, Weijin Zhou, Weikang Wang, Wesleye Chen, Xiao Feng, Xiaoqin Ren, Xingwu Sun, Xiong Kuang, Xuemeng Huang, Xun Cao, Yanfeng Chen, Yang Du, Yang Zhen, Yangyu Tao, Yaping Deng, Yi Shen, Yigeng Hong, Yiqi Chen, Yiqing Huang, Yuchi Deng, Yue Mao, Yulong Wang, Yuyuan Zeng, Zenan Xu, Zhanhui Kang, Zhe Zhao, ZhenXiang Yan, Zheng Fang, Zhichao Hu, Zhongzhi Chen, Zhuoyu Li, Zongwei Li, Alex Yan, Ande Liang, Baitong Liu, Beiping Pan, Bin Xing, Binghong Wu, Bingxin Qu, Bolin Ni, Boyu Wu, Chen Li, Cheng Jiang, Cheng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15431)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly advance, we introduce Hunyuan-TurboS, a novel large hybrid Transformer-Mamba Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. It synergistically combines Mamba's long-sequence processing efficiency with Transformer's superior contextual understanding. Hunyuan-TurboS features an adaptive long-short chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism, dynamically switching between rapid responses for simple queries and deep "thinking" modes for complex problems, optimizing computational resources. Architecturally, this 56B activated (560B total) parameter model employs 128 layers (Mamba2, Attention, FFN) with an innovative AMF/MF block pattern. Faster Mamba2 ensures linear complexity, Grouped-Query Attention minimizes KV cache, and FFNs use an MoE structure. Pre-trained on 16T high-quality tokens, it supports a 256K context length and is the first industry-deployed large-scale Mamba model. Our comprehensive post-training strategy enhances capabilities via Supervised Fine-Tuning (3M instructions), a novel Adaptive Long-short CoT Fusion method, Multi-round Deliberation Learning for iterative improvement, and a two-stage Large-scale Reinforcement Learning process targeting STEM and general instruction-following. Evaluations show strong performance: overall top 7 rank on LMSYS Chatbot Arena with a score of 1356, outperforming leading models like Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 (1352) and o4-mini-2025-04-16 (1345). TurboS also achieves an average of 77.9% across 23 automated benchmarks. Hunyuan-TurboS balances high performance and efficiency, offering substantial capabilities at lower inference costs than many reasoning models, establishing a new paradigm for efficient large-scale pre-trained models.

# Protoknowledge Shapes Behaviour of LLMs in Downstream Tasks: Memorization and Generalization with Knowledge Graphs 

**Authors**: Federico Ranaldi, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Ranaldi, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15501)  

**Abstract**: We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs). Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms, varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.

# An Empirical Study of the Anchoring Effect in LLMs: Existence, Mechanism, and Potential Mitigations 

**Authors**: Yiming Huang, Biquan Bie, Zuqiu Na, Weilin Ruan, Songxin Lei, Yutao Yue, Xinlei He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15392)  

**Abstract**: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has advanced natural language processing, yet concerns about cognitive biases are growing. In this paper, we investigate the anchoring effect, a cognitive bias where the mind relies heavily on the first information as anchors to make affected judgments. We explore whether LLMs are affected by anchoring, the underlying mechanisms, and potential mitigation strategies. To facilitate studies at scale on the anchoring effect, we introduce a new dataset, SynAnchors. Combining refined evaluation metrics, we benchmark current widely used LLMs. Our findings show that LLMs' anchoring bias exists commonly with shallow-layer acting and is not eliminated by conventional strategies, while reasoning can offer some mitigation. This recontextualization via cognitive psychology urges that LLM evaluations focus not on standard benchmarks or over-optimized robustness tests, but on cognitive-bias-aware trustworthy evaluation.

# RePPL: Recalibrating Perplexity by Uncertainty in Semantic Propagation and Language Generation for Explainable QA Hallucination Detection 

**Authors**: Yiming Huang, Junyan Zhang, Zihao Wang, Biquan Bie, Xuming Hu, Yi R., Fung, Xinlei He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15386)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become powerful, but hallucinations remain a vital obstacle to their trustworthy use. While previous works improved the capability of hallucination detection by measuring uncertainty, they all lack the ability to explain the provenance behind why hallucinations occur, i.e., which part of the inputs tends to trigger hallucinations. Recent works on the prompt attack indicate that uncertainty exists in semantic propagation, where attention mechanisms gradually fuse local token information into high-level semantics across layers. Meanwhile, uncertainty also emerges in language generation, due to its probability-based selection of high-level semantics for sampled generations. Based on that, we propose RePPL to recalibrate uncertainty measurement by these two aspects, which dispatches explainable uncertainty scores to each token and aggregates in Perplexity-style Log-Average form as total score. Experiments show that our method achieves the best comprehensive detection performance across various QA datasets on advanced models (average AUC of 0.833), and our method is capable of producing token-level uncertainty scores as explanations for the hallucination. Leveraging these scores, we preliminarily find the chaotic pattern of hallucination and showcase its promising usage.

# X-WebAgentBench: A Multilingual Interactive Web Benchmark for Evaluating Global Agentic System 

**Authors**: Peng Wang, Ruihan Tao, Qiguang Chen, Mengkang Hu, Libo Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15372)  

**Abstract**: Recently, large language model (LLM)-based agents have achieved significant success in interactive environments, attracting significant academic and industrial attention. Despite these advancements, current research predominantly focuses on English scenarios. In reality, there are over 7,000 languages worldwide, all of which demand access to comparable agentic services. Nevertheless, the development of language agents remains inadequate for meeting the diverse requirements of multilingual agentic applications. To fill this gap, we introduce X-WebAgentBench, a novel multilingual agent benchmark in an interactive web environment, which evaluates the planning and interaction performance of language agents across multiple languages, thereby contributing to the advancement of global agent intelligence. Additionally, we assess the performance of various LLMs and cross-lingual alignment methods, examining their effectiveness in enhancing agents. Our findings reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o, when combined with cross-lingual techniques, fail to achieve satisfactory results. We hope that X-WebAgentBench can serve as a valuable benchmark for multilingual agent scenario in real-world applications.

# NL-Debugging: Exploiting Natural Language as an Intermediate Representation for Code Debugging 

**Authors**: Weiming Zhang, Qingyao Li, Xinyi Dai, Jizheng Chen, Kounianhua Du, Weinan Zhang, Weiwen Liu, Yasheng Wang, Ruiming Tang, Yong Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15356)  

**Abstract**: Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.

# Your Language Model Can Secretly Write Like Humans: Contrastive Paraphrase Attacks on LLM-Generated Text Detectors 

**Authors**: Hao Fang, Jiawei Kong, Tianqu Zhuang, Yixiang Qiu, Kuofeng Gao, Bin Chen, Shu-Tao Xia, Yaowei Wang, Min Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15337)  

**Abstract**: The misuse of large language models (LLMs), such as academic plagiarism, has driven the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. To bypass these detectors, paraphrase attacks have emerged to purposely rewrite these texts to evade detection. Despite the success, existing methods require substantial data and computational budgets to train a specialized paraphraser, and their attack efficacy greatly reduces when faced with advanced detection algorithms. To address this, we propose \textbf{Co}ntrastive \textbf{P}araphrase \textbf{A}ttack (CoPA), a training-free method that effectively deceives text detectors using off-the-shelf LLMs. The first step is to carefully craft instructions that encourage LLMs to produce more human-like texts. Nonetheless, we observe that the inherent statistical biases of LLMs can still result in some generated texts carrying certain machine-like attributes that can be captured by detectors. To overcome this, CoPA constructs an auxiliary machine-like word distribution as a contrast to the human-like distribution generated by the LLM. By subtracting the machine-like patterns from the human-like distribution during the decoding process, CoPA is able to produce sentences that are less discernible by text detectors. Our theoretical analysis suggests the superiority of the proposed attack. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CoPA in fooling text detectors across various scenarios.

# Improving LLM First-Token Predictions in Multiple-Choice Question Answering via Prefilling Attack 

**Authors**: Silvia Cappelletti, Tobia Poppi, Samuele Poppi, Zheng-Xin Yong, Diego Garcia-Olano, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15323)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) tasks using *first-token probability* (FTP), which selects the answer option whose initial token has the highest likelihood. While efficient, FTP can be fragile: models may assign high probability to unrelated tokens (*misalignment*) or use a valid token merely as part of a generic preamble rather than as a clear answer choice (*misinterpretation*), undermining the reliability of symbolic evaluation. We propose a simple solution: the *prefilling attack*, a structured natural-language prefix (e.g., "*The correct option is:*") prepended to the model output. Originally explored in AI safety, we repurpose prefilling to steer the model to respond with a clean, valid option, without modifying its parameters. Empirically, the FTP with prefilling strategy substantially improves accuracy, calibration, and output consistency across a broad set of LLMs and MCQA benchmarks. It outperforms standard FTP and often matches the performance of open-ended generation approaches that require full decoding and external classifiers, while being significantly more efficient. Our findings suggest that prefilling is a simple, robust, and low-cost method to enhance the reliability of FTP-based evaluation in multiple-choice settings.

**Authors**: Aleksandra Tomaszewska, Dariusz Czerski, Bartosz Żuk, Maciej Ogrodniczuk  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15426)  

**Abstract**: NeoN, a tool for detecting and analyzing Polish neologisms. Unlike traditional dictionary-based methods requiring extensive manual review, NeoN combines reference corpora, Polish-specific linguistic filters, an LLM-driven precision-boosting filter, and daily RSS monitoring in a multi-layered pipeline. The system uses context-aware lemmatization, frequency analysis, and orthographic normalization to extract candidate neologisms while consolidating inflectional variants. Researchers can verify candidates through an intuitive interface with visualizations and filtering controls. An integrated LLM module automatically generates definitions and categorizes neologisms by domain and sentiment. Evaluations show NeoN maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing manual effort, providing an accessible solution for tracking lexical innovation in Polish.

# Single LLM, Multiple Roles: A Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework Using Role-Specific Token Optimization 

**Authors**: Yutao Zhu, Jiajie Jin, Hongjin Qian, Zheng Liu, Zhicheng Dou, Ji-Rong Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15444)  

**Abstract**: Existing studies have optimized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) across various sub-tasks, such as query understanding and retrieval refinement, but integrating these optimizations into a unified framework remains challenging. To tackle this problem, this work proposes RoleRAG, a unified RAG framework that achieves efficient multi-task processing through role-specific token optimization. RoleRAG comprises six modules, each handling a specific sub-task within the RAG process. Additionally, we introduce a query graph to represent the decomposition of the query, which can be dynamically resolved according to the decomposing state. All modules are driven by the same underlying LLM, distinguished by task-specific role tokens that are individually optimized. This design allows RoleRAG to dynamically activate different modules within a single LLM instance, thereby streamlining deployment and reducing resource consumption. Experimental results on five open-domain question-answering datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generalizability, and flexibility of our framework.

# How Should We Enhance the Safety of Large Reasoning Models: An Empirical Study 

**Authors**: Zhexin Zhang, Xian Qi Loye, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Junxiao Yang, Qi Zhu, Shiyao Cui, Fei Mi, Lifeng Shang, Yingkang Wang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15404)  

**Abstract**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable success on reasoning-intensive tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, their enhanced reasoning capabilities do not necessarily translate to improved safety performance-and in some cases, may even degrade it. This raises an important research question: how can we enhance the safety of LRMs? In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on how to enhance the safety of LRMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Our investigation begins with an unexpected observation: directly distilling safe responses from DeepSeek-R1 fails to significantly enhance safety. We analyze this phenomenon and identify three key failure patterns that contribute to it. We then demonstrate that explicitly addressing these issues during the data distillation process can lead to substantial safety improvements. Next, we explore whether a long and complex reasoning process is necessary for achieving safety. Interestingly, we find that simply using short or template-based reasoning process can attain comparable safety performance-and are significantly easier for models to learn than more intricate reasoning chains. These findings prompt a deeper reflection on the role of reasoning in ensuring safety. Finally, we find that mixing math reasoning data during safety fine-tuning is helpful to balance safety and over-refusal. Overall, we hope our empirical study could provide a more holistic picture on enhancing the safety of LRMs. The code and data used in our experiments are released in this https URL.

# Chinese Toxic Language Mitigation via Sentiment Polarity Consistent Rewrites 

**Authors**: Xintong Wang, Yixiao Liu, Jingheng Pan, Liang Ding, Longyue Wang, Chris Biemann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15297)  

**Abstract**: Detoxifying offensive language while preserving the speaker's original intent is a challenging yet critical goal for improving the quality of online interactions. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in rewriting toxic content, they often default to overly polite rewrites, distorting the emotional tone and communicative intent. This problem is especially acute in Chinese, where toxicity often arises implicitly through emojis, homophones, or discourse context. We present ToxiRewriteCN, the first Chinese detoxification dataset explicitly designed to preserve sentiment polarity. The dataset comprises 1,556 carefully annotated triplets, each containing a toxic sentence, a sentiment-aligned non-toxic rewrite, and labeled toxic spans. It covers five real-world scenarios: standard expressions, emoji-induced and homophonic toxicity, as well as single-turn and multi-turn dialogues. We evaluate 17 LLMs, including commercial and open-source models with variant architectures, across four dimensions: detoxification accuracy, fluency, content preservation, and sentiment polarity. Results show that while commercial and MoE models perform best overall, all models struggle to balance safety with emotional fidelity in more subtle or context-heavy settings such as emoji, homophone, and dialogue-based inputs. We release ToxiRewriteCN to support future research on controllable, sentiment-aware detoxification for Chinese.

# Hallucinate at the Last in Long Response Generation: A Case Study on Long Document Summarization 

**Authors**: Joonho Yang, Seunghyun Yoon, Hwan Chang, Byeongjeong Kim, Hwanhee Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15291)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced text generation capabilities, including tasks like summarization, often producing coherent and fluent outputs. However, faithfulness to source material remains a significant challenge due to the generation of hallucinations. While extensive research focuses on detecting and reducing these inaccuracies, less attention has been paid to the positional distribution of hallucination within generated text, particularly in long outputs. In this work, we investigate where hallucinations occur in LLM-based long response generation, using long document summarization as a key case study. Focusing on the challenging setting of long context-aware long response generation, we find a consistent and concerning phenomenon: hallucinations tend to concentrate disproportionately in the latter parts of the generated long response. To understand this bias, we explore potential contributing factors related to the dynamics of attention and decoding over long sequences. Furthermore, we investigate methods to mitigate this positional hallucination, aiming to improve faithfulness specifically in the concluding segments of long outputs.

# FlowKV: Enhancing Multi-Turn Conversational Coherence in LLMs via Isolated Key-Value Cache Management 

**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Hong Chen, Xuming Hu, Xiaowen Chu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15347)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn conversational applications, where the management of the Key-Value (KV) Cache presents a significant bottleneck. The linear growth of the KV Cache with dialogue history imposes substantial computational costs, and existing eviction strategies often degrade performance by repeatedly compressing early conversational context, leading to information loss and context forgetting. This paper introduces FlowKV, a novel \textbf{multi-turn isolation mechanism} for KV Cache management, which can be applied to any KV Cache compression method without training. FlowKV's core innovation is a multi-turn isolation mechanism that preserves the accumulated compressed KV cache from past turns. Compression is then strategically applied only to the newly generated KV pairs of the latest completed turn, effectively preventing the re-compression of older context and thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our results demonstrate that FlowKV consistently and significantly outperforms baseline strategies in maintaining instruction-following accuracy and user preference retention from 10.90\% to 75.40\%, particularly in later conversational turns.

# When Less Language is More: Language-Reasoning Disentanglement Makes LLMs Better Multilingual Reasoners 

**Authors**: Weixiang Zhao, Jiahe Guo, Yang Deng, Tongtong Wu, Wenxuan Zhang, Yulin Hu, Xingyu Sui, Yanyan Zhao, Wanxiang Che, Bing Qin, Tat-Seng Chua, Ting Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15257)  

**Abstract**: Multilingual reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), with performance disproportionately favoring high-resource languages. Drawing inspiration from cognitive neuroscience, which suggests that human reasoning functions largely independently of language processing, we hypothesize that LLMs similarly encode reasoning and language as separable components that can be disentangled to enhance multilingual reasoning. To evaluate this, we perform a causal intervention by ablating language-specific representations at inference time. Experiments on 10 open-source LLMs spanning 11 typologically diverse languages show that this language-specific ablation consistently boosts multilingual reasoning performance. Layer-wise analyses further confirm that language and reasoning representations can be effectively decoupled throughout the model, yielding improved multilingual reasoning capabilities, while preserving top-layer language features remains essential for maintaining linguistic fidelity. Compared to post-training such as supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, our training-free ablation achieves comparable or superior results with minimal computational overhead. These findings shed light on the internal mechanisms underlying multilingual reasoning in LLMs and suggest a lightweight and interpretable strategy for improving cross-lingual generalization.

# Towards Explainable Temporal Reasoning in Large Language Models: A Structure-Aware Generative Framework 

**Authors**: Zihao Jiang, Ben Liu, Miao Peng, Wenjie Xu, Yao Xiao, Zhenyan Shan, Min Peng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15245)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) show great potential in temporal reasoning, most existing work focuses heavily on enhancing performance, often neglecting the explainable reasoning processes underlying the results. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering a wide range of temporal granularities, designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in explainable temporal reasoning. Furthermore, our findings reveal that LLMs struggle to deliver convincing explanations when relying solely on textual information. To address challenge, we propose GETER, a novel structure-aware generative framework that integrates Graph structures with text for Explainable TEmporal Reasoning. Specifically, we first leverage temporal knowledge graphs to develop a temporal encoder that captures structural information for the query. Subsequently, we introduce a structure-text prefix adapter to map graph structure features into the text embedding space. Finally, LLMs generate explanation text by seamlessly integrating the soft graph token with instruction-tuning prompt tokens. Experimental results indicate that GETER achieves state-of-the-art performance while also demonstrating its effectiveness as well as strong generalization capabilities. Our dataset and code are available at this https URL.

# Emotional Supporters often Use Multiple Strategies in a Single Turn 

**Authors**: Xin Bai, Guanyi Chen, Tingting He, Chenlian Zhou, Yu Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15316)  

**Abstract**: Emotional Support Conversations (ESC) are crucial for providing empathy, validation, and actionable guidance to individuals in distress. However, existing definitions of the ESC task oversimplify the structure of supportive responses, typically modelling them as single strategy-utterance pairs. Through a detailed corpus analysis of the ESConv dataset, we identify a common yet previously overlooked phenomenon: emotional supporters often employ multiple strategies consecutively within a single turn. We formally redefine the ESC task to account for this, proposing a revised formulation that requires generating the full sequence of strategy-utterance pairs given a dialogue history. To facilitate this refined task, we introduce several modelling approaches, including supervised deep learning models and large language models. Our experiments show that, under this redefined task, state-of-the-art LLMs outperform both supervised models and human supporters. Notably, contrary to some earlier findings, we observe that LLMs frequently ask questions and provide suggestions, demonstrating more holistic support capabilities.

# Multilingual Prompting for Improving LLM Generation Diversity 

**Authors**: Qihan Wang, Shidong Pan, Tal Linzen, Emily Black  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15229)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to lack cultural representation and overall diversity in their generations, from expressing opinions to answering factual questions. To mitigate this problem, we propose multilingual prompting: a prompting method which generates several variations of a base prompt with added cultural and linguistic cues from several cultures, generates responses, and then combines the results. Building on evidence that LLMs have language-specific knowledge, multilingual prompting seeks to increase diversity by activating a broader range of cultural knowledge embedded in model training data. Through experiments across multiple models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA 70B, and LLaMA 8B), we show that multilingual prompting consistently outperforms existing diversity-enhancing techniques such as high-temperature sampling, step-by-step recall, and personas prompting. Further analyses show that the benefits of multilingual prompting vary with language resource level and model size, and that aligning the prompting language with the cultural cues reduces hallucination about culturally-specific information.

# Deliberation on Priors: Trustworthy Reasoning of Large Language Models on Knowledge Graphs 

**Authors**: Jie Ma, Ning Qu, Zhitao Gao, Rui Xing, Jun Liu, Hongbin Pei, Jiang Xie, Linyun Song, Pinghui Wang, Jing Tao, Zhou Su  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15210)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation. Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The code is available at this https URL.

# ReflAct: World-Grounded Decision Making in LLM Agents via Goal-State Reflection 

**Authors**: Jeonghye Kim, Sojeong Rhee, Minbeom Kim, Dohyung Kim, Sangmook Lee, Youngchul Sung, Kyomin Jung  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15182)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in LLM agents have largely built on reasoning backbones like ReAct, which interleave thought and action in complex environments. However, ReAct often produces ungrounded or incoherent reasoning steps, leading to misalignment between the agent's actual state and goal. Our analysis finds that this stems from ReAct's inability to maintain consistent internal beliefs and goal alignment, causing compounding errors and hallucinations. To address this, we introduce ReflAct, a novel backbone that shifts reasoning from merely planning next actions to continuously reflecting on the agent's state relative to its goal. By explicitly grounding decisions in states and enforcing ongoing goal alignment, ReflAct dramatically improves strategic reliability. This design delivers substantial empirical gains: ReflAct surpasses ReAct by 27.7% on average, achieving a 93.3% success rate in ALFWorld. Notably, ReflAct even outperforms ReAct with added enhancement modules (e.g., Reflexion, WKM), showing that strengthening the core reasoning backbone is key to reliable agent performance.

# An Empirical Study on Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning-Search Interleaved LLM Agents 

**Authors**: Bowen Jin, Jinsung Yoon, Priyanka Kargupta, Sercan O. Arik, Jiawei Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15117)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use. While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized) significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained agent during inference. These establish important guidelines for successfully building and deploying LLM-based search agents in real-world applications. Code is available at this https URL.

# StepSearch: Igniting LLMs Search Ability via Step-Wise Proximal Policy Optimization 

**Authors**: Ziliang Wang, Xuhui Zheng, Kang An, Cijun Ouyang, Jialu Cai, Yuhang Wang, Yichao Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15107)  

**Abstract**: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our implementation is publicly available at this https URL.

# MentalMAC: Enhancing Large Language Models for Detecting Mental Manipulation via Multi-Task Anti-Curriculum Distillation 

**Authors**: Yuansheng Gao, Han Bao, Tong Zhang, Bin Li, Zonghui Wang, Wenzhi Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15255)  

**Abstract**: Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of psychological abuse that poses serious threats to mental health. Its covert nature and the complexity of manipulation strategies make it challenging to detect, even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). This concealment also hinders the manual collection of large-scale, high-quality annotations essential for training effective models. Although recent efforts have sought to improve LLM's performance on this task, progress remains limited due to the scarcity of real-world annotated datasets. To address these challenges, we propose MentalMAC, a multi-task anti-curriculum distillation method that enhances LLMs' ability to detect mental manipulation in multi-turn dialogue. Our approach includes: (i) EvoSA, an unsupervised data expansion method based on evolutionary operations and speech act theory; (ii) teacher-model-generated multi-task supervision; and (iii) progressive knowledge distillation from complex to simpler tasks. We then constructed the ReaMent dataset with 5,000 real-world dialogue samples, using a MentalMAC-distilled model to assist human annotation. Vast experiments demonstrate that our method significantly narrows the gap between student and teacher models and outperforms competitive LLMs across key evaluation metrics. All code, datasets, and checkpoints will be released upon paper acceptance. Warning: This paper contains content that may be offensive to readers.

**Authors**: Jing Yu, Yuqi Tang, Kehua Feng, Mingyang Rao, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Mengshu Sun, Wen Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Keyan Ding, Huajun Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15094)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies: Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection, Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.

# Traveling Across Languages: Benchmarking Cross-Lingual Consistency in Multimodal LLMs 

**Authors**: Hao Wang, Pinzhi Huang, Jihan Yang, Saining Xie, Daisuke Kawahara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15075)  

**Abstract**: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

# Prolonged Reasoning Is Not All You Need: Certainty-Based Adaptive Routing for Efficient LLM/MLLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Jinghui Lu, Haiyang Yu, Siliang Xu, Shiwei Ran, Guozhi Tang, Siqi Wang, Bin Shan, Teng Fu, Hao Feng, Jingqun Tang, Han Wang, Can Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15154)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in reasoning have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks. However, excessive reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can impair model performance and brings unnecessarily lengthened outputs, reducing efficiency. Our work reveals that prolonged reasoning does not universally improve accuracy and even degrade performance on simpler tasks. To address this, we propose Certainty-based Adaptive Reasoning (CAR), a novel framework that dynamically switches between short answers and long-form reasoning based on the model perplexity. CAR first generates a short answer and evaluates its perplexity, triggering reasoning only when the model exhibits low confidence (i.e., high perplexity). Experiments across diverse multimodal VQA/KIE benchmarks and text reasoning datasets show that CAR outperforms both short-answer and long-form reasoning approaches, striking an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency.

# Can Large Language Models Understand Internet Buzzwords Through User-Generated Content 

**Authors**: Chen Huang, Junkai Luo, Xinzuo Wang, Wenqiang Lei, Jiancheng Lv  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15071)  

**Abstract**: The massive user-generated content (UGC) available in Chinese social media is giving rise to the possibility of studying internet buzzwords. In this paper, we study if large language models (LLMs) can generate accurate definitions for these buzzwords based on UGC as examples. Our work serves a threefold contribution. First, we introduce CHEER, the first dataset of Chinese internet buzzwords, each annotated with a definition and relevant UGC. Second, we propose a novel method, called RESS, to effectively steer the comprehending process of LLMs to produce more accurate buzzword definitions, mirroring the skills of human language learning. Third, with CHEER, we benchmark the strengths and weaknesses of various off-the-shelf definition generation methods and our RESS. Our benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RESS while revealing crucial shared challenges: over-reliance on prior exposure, underdeveloped inferential abilities, and difficulty identifying high-quality UGC to facilitate comprehension. We believe our work lays the groundwork for future advancements in LLM-based definition generation. Our dataset and code are available at this https URL.

# Self-GIVE: Associative Thinking from Limited Structured Knowledge for Enhanced Large Language Model Reasoning 

**Authors**: Jiashu He, Jinxuan Fan, Bowen Jiang, Ignacio Houine, Dan Roth, Alejandro Ribeiro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15062)  

**Abstract**: When addressing complex questions that require new information, people often associate the question with existing knowledge to derive a sensible answer. For instance, when evaluating whether melatonin aids insomnia, one might associate "hormones helping mental disorders" with "melatonin being a hormone and insomnia a mental disorder" to complete the reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) also require such associative thinking, particularly in resolving scientific inquiries when retrieved knowledge is insufficient and does not directly answer the question. Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE) addresses this by using a knowledge graph (KG) to extrapolate structured knowledge. However, it involves the construction and pruning of many hypothetical triplets, which limits efficiency and generalizability. We propose Self-GIVE, a retrieve-RL framework that enhances LLMs with automatic associative thinking through reinforcement learning. Self-GIVE extracts structured information and entity sets to assist the model in linking to the queried concepts. We address GIVE's key limitations: (1) extensive LLM calls and token overhead for knowledge extrapolation, (2) difficulty in deploying on smaller LLMs (3B or 7B) due to complex instructions, and (3) inaccurate knowledge from LLM pruning. Specifically, after fine-tuning using self-GIVE with a 135 node UMLS KG, it improves the performance of the Qwen2.5 3B and 7B models by up to $\textbf{28.5%$\rightarrow$71.4%}$ and $\textbf{78.6$\rightarrow$90.5%}$ in samples $\textbf{unseen}$ in challenging biomedical QA tasks. In particular, Self-GIVE allows the 7B model to match or outperform GPT3.5 turbo with GIVE, while cutting token usage by over 90\%. Self-GIVE enhances the scalable integration of structured retrieval and reasoning with associative thinking.

# Lost in Benchmarks? Rethinking Large Language Model Benchmarking with Item Response Theory 

**Authors**: Hongli Zhou, Hui Huang, Ziqing Zhao, Lvyuan Han, Huicheng Wang, Kehai Chen, Muyun Yang, Wei Bao, Jian Dong, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Hailong Cao, Tiejun Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15055)  

**Abstract**: The evaluation of large language models (LLMs) via benchmarks is widespread, yet inconsistencies between different leaderboards and poor separability among top models raise concerns about their ability to accurately reflect authentic model capabilities. This paper provides a critical analysis of benchmark effectiveness, examining main-stream prominent LLM benchmarks using results from diverse models. We first propose a new framework for accurate and reliable estimations of item characteristics and model abilities. Specifically, we propose Pseudo-Siamese Network for Item Response Theory (PSN-IRT), an enhanced Item Response Theory framework that incorporates a rich set of item parameters within an IRT-grounded architecture. Based on PSN-IRT, we conduct extensive analysis which reveals significant and varied shortcomings in the measurement quality of current benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that leveraging PSN-IRT is able to construct smaller benchmarks while maintaining stronger alignment with human preference.

# RoT: Enhancing Table Reasoning with Iterative Row-Wise Traversals 

**Authors**: Xuanliang Zhang, Dingzirui Wang, Keyan Xu, Qingfu Zhu, Wanxiang Che  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15110)  

**Abstract**: The table reasoning task, crucial for efficient data acquisition, aims to answer questions based on the given table. Recently, reasoning large language models (RLLMs) with Long Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) significantly enhance reasoning capabilities, leading to brilliant performance on table reasoning. However, Long CoT suffers from high cost for training and exhibits low reliability due to table content hallucinations. Therefore, we propose Row-of-Thought (RoT), which performs iteratively row-wise table traversal, allowing for reasoning extension and reflection-based refinement at each traversal. Scaling reasoning length by row-wise traversal and leveraging reflection capabilities of LLMs, RoT is training-free. The sequential traversal encourages greater attention to the table, thus reducing hallucinations. Experiments show that RoT, using non-reasoning models, outperforms RLLMs by an average of 4.3%, and achieves state-of-the-art results on WikiTableQuestions and TableBench with comparable models, proving its effectiveness. Also, RoT outperforms Long CoT with fewer reasoning tokens, indicating higher efficiency.

# UrduFactCheck: An Agentic Fact-Checking Framework for Urdu with Evidence Boosting and Benchmarking 

**Authors**: Sarfraz Ahmad, Hasan Iqbal, Momina Ahsan, Numaan Naeem, Muhammad Ahsan Riaz Khan, Arham Riaz, Muhammad Arslan Manzoor, Yuxia Wang, Preslav Nakov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15063)  

**Abstract**: The rapid use of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical concerns regarding the factual reliability of their outputs, especially in low-resource languages such as Urdu. Existing automated fact-checking solutions overwhelmingly focus on English, leaving a significant gap for the 200+ million Urdu speakers worldwide. In this work, we introduce UrduFactCheck, the first comprehensive, modular fact-checking framework specifically tailored for Urdu. Our system features a dynamic, multi-strategy evidence retrieval pipeline that combines monolingual and translation-based approaches to address the scarcity of high-quality Urdu evidence. We curate and release two new hand-annotated benchmarks: UrduFactBench for claim verification and UrduFactQA for evaluating LLM factuality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrduFactCheck, particularly its translation-augmented variants, consistently outperforms baselines and open-source alternatives on multiple metrics. We further benchmark twelve state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on factual question answering in Urdu, highlighting persistent gaps between proprietary and open-source models. UrduFactCheck's code and datasets are open-sourced and publicly available at this https URL.

# Diffusion vs. Autoregressive Language Models: A Text Embedding Perspective 

**Authors**: Siyue Zhang, Yilun Zhao, Liyuan Geng, Arman Cohan, Anh Tuan Luu, Chen Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15045)  

**Abstract**: Large language model (LLM)-based embedding models, benefiting from large scale pre-training and post-training, have begun to surpass BERT and T5-based models on general-purpose text embedding tasks such as document retrieval. However, a fundamental limitation of LLM embeddings lies in the unidirectional attention used during autoregressive pre-training, which misaligns with the bidirectional nature of text embedding tasks. To this end, We propose adopting diffusion language models for text embeddings, motivated by their inherent bidirectional architecture and recent success in matching or surpassing LLMs especially on reasoning tasks. We present the first systematic study of the diffusion language embedding model, which outperforms the LLM-based embedding model by 20% on long-document retrieval, 8% on reasoning-intensive retrieval, 2% on instruction-following retrieval, and achieve competitive performance on traditional text embedding benchmarks. Our analysis verifies that bidirectional attention is crucial for encoding global context in long and complex text.

# Diagnosing our datasets: How does my language model learn clinical information? 

**Authors**: Furong Jia, David Sontag, Monica Agrawal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15024)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and (2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo. Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage. Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition.

# Denoising Concept Vectors with Sparse Autoencoders for Improved Language Model Steering 

**Authors**: Haiyan Zhao, Xuansheng Wu, Fan Yang, Bo Shen, Ninghao Liu, Mengnan Du  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15038)  

**Abstract**: Linear Concept Vectors have proven effective for steering large language models (LLMs). While existing approaches like linear probing and difference-in-means derive these vectors from LLM hidden representations, diverse data introduces noises (i.e., irrelevant features) that challenge steering robustness. To address this, we propose Sparse Autoencoder-Denoised Concept Vectors (SDCV), which uses Sparse Autoencoders to filter out noisy features from hidden representations. When applied to linear probing and difference-in-means, our method improves their steering success rates. We validate our noise hypothesis through counterfactual experiments and feature visualizations.

# Towards Spoken Mathematical Reasoning: Benchmarking Speech-based Models over Multi-faceted Math Problems 

**Authors**: Chengwei Wei, Bin Wang, Jung-jae Kim, Nancy F. Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15000)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) have led to strong reasoning ability across a wide range of tasks. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning from spoken input remains underexplored. Prior studies on speech modality have mostly focused on factual speech understanding or simple audio reasoning tasks, providing limited insight into logical step-by-step reasoning, such as that required for mathematical problem solving. To address this gap, we introduce Spoken Math Question Answering (Spoken-MQA), a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of speech-based models, including both cascade models (ASR + LLMs) and end-to-end speech LLMs. Spoken-MQA covers a diverse set of math problems, including pure arithmetic, single-step and multi-step contextual reasoning, and knowledge-oriented reasoning problems, all presented in unambiguous natural spoken language. Through extensive experiments, we find that: (1) while some speech LLMs perform competitively on contextual reasoning tasks involving basic arithmetic, they still struggle with direct arithmetic problems; (2) current LLMs exhibit a strong bias toward symbolic mathematical expressions written in LaTex and have difficulty interpreting verbalized mathematical expressions; and (3) mathematical knowledge reasoning abilities are significantly degraded in current speech LLMs.

# Effective and Efficient Schema-aware Information Extraction Using On-Device Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Zhihao Wen, Sheng Liang, Yaxiong Wu, Yongyue Zhang, Yong Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14992)  

**Abstract**: Information extraction (IE) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by converting unstructured text into structured knowledge. Deploying computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices for information extraction is challenging, particularly due to issues like hallucinations, limited context length, and high latency-especially when handling diverse extraction schemas. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage information extraction approach adapted for on-device LLMs, called Dual-LoRA with Incremental Schema Caching (DLISC), which enhances both schema identification and schema-aware extraction in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, DLISC adopts an Identification LoRA module for retrieving the most relevant schemas to a given query, and an Extraction LoRA module for performing information extraction based on the previously selected schemas. To accelerate extraction inference, Incremental Schema Caching is incorporated to reduce redundant computation, substantially improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple information extraction datasets demonstrate notable improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.

# Language Specific Knowledge: Do Models Know Better in X than in English? 

**Authors**: Ishika Agarwal, Nimet Beyza Bozdag, Dilek Hakkani-Tür  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14990)  

**Abstract**: Code-switching is a common phenomenon of alternating between different languages in the same utterance, thought, or conversation. We posit that humans code-switch because they feel more comfortable talking about certain topics and domains in one language than another. With the rise of knowledge-intensive language models, we ask ourselves the next, natural question: Could models hold more knowledge on some topics in some language X? More importantly, could we improve reasoning by changing the language that reasoning is performed in? We coin the term Language Specific Knowledge (LSK) to represent this phenomenon. As ethnic cultures tend to develop alongside different languages, we employ culture-specific datasets (that contain knowledge about cultural and social behavioral norms). We find that language models can perform better when using chain-of-thought reasoning in some languages other than English, sometimes even better in low-resource languages. Paired with previous works showing that semantic similarity does not equate to representational similarity, we hypothesize that culturally specific texts occur more abundantly in corresponding languages, enabling specific knowledge to occur only in specific "expert" languages. Motivated by our initial results, we design a simple methodology called LSKExtractor to benchmark the language-specific knowledge present in a language model and, then, exploit it during inference. We show our results on various models and datasets, showing an average relative improvement of 10% in accuracy. Our research contributes to the open-source development of language models that are inclusive and more aligned with the cultural and linguistic contexts in which they are deployed.

# MedBrowseComp: Benchmarking Medical Deep Research and Computer Use 

**Authors**: Shan Chen, Pedro Moreira, Yuxin Xiao, Sam Schmidgall, Jeremy Warner, Hugo Aerts, Thomas Hartvigsen, Jack Gallifant, Danielle S. Bitterman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14963)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as decision-support tools in clinical practice, yet safe clinical reasoning demands integrating heterogeneous knowledge bases -- trials, primary studies, regulatory documents, and cost data -- under strict accuracy constraints. Existing evaluations often rely on synthetic prompts, reduce the task to single-hop factoid queries, or conflate reasoning with open-ended generation, leaving their real-world utility unclear. To close this gap, we present MedBrowseComp, the first benchmark that systematically tests an agent's ability to reliably retrieve and synthesize multi-hop medical facts from live, domain-specific knowledge bases. MedBrowseComp contains more than 1,000 human-curated questions that mirror clinical scenarios where practitioners must reconcile fragmented or conflicting information to reach an up-to-date conclusion. Applying MedBrowseComp to frontier agentic systems reveals performance shortfalls as low as ten percent, exposing a critical gap between current LLM capabilities and the rigor demanded in clinical settings. MedBrowseComp therefore offers a clear testbed for reliable medical information seeking and sets concrete goals for future model and toolchain upgrades.

# Improving the fact-checking performance of language models by relying on their entailment ability 

**Authors**: Gaurav Kumar, Debajyoti Mazumder, Ayush Garg, Jasabanta Patro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15050)  

**Abstract**: Automated fact-checking is a crucial task in this digital age. To verify a claim, current approaches majorly follow one of two strategies i.e. (i) relying on embedded knowledge of language models, and (ii) fine-tuning them with evidence pieces. While the former can make systems to hallucinate, the later have not been very successful till date. The primary reason behind this is that fact verification is a complex process. Language models have to parse through multiple pieces of evidence before making a prediction. Further, the evidence pieces often contradict each other. This makes the reasoning process even more complex. We proposed a simple yet effective approach where we relied on entailment and the generative ability of language models to produce ''supporting'' and ''refuting'' justifications (for the truthfulness of a claim). We trained language models based on these justifications and achieved superior results. Apart from that, we did a systematic comparison of different prompting and fine-tuning strategies, as it is currently lacking in the literature. Some of our observations are: (i) training language models with raw evidence sentences registered an improvement up to 8.20% in macro-F1, over the best performing baseline for the RAW-FC dataset, (ii) similarly, training language models with prompted claim-evidence understanding (TBE-2) registered an improvement (with a margin up to 16.39%) over the baselines for the same dataset, (iii) training language models with entailed justifications (TBE-3) outperformed the baselines by a huge margin (up to 28.57% and 44.26% for LIAR-RAW and RAW-FC, respectively). We have shared our code repository to reproduce the results.

# Reliable Decision Support with LLMs: A Framework for Evaluating Consistency in Binary Text Classification Applications 

**Authors**: Fadel M. Megahed, Ying-Ju Chen, L. Allision Jones-Farmer, Younghwa Lee, Jiawei Brooke Wang, Inez M. Zwetsloot  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14918)  

**Abstract**: This study introduces a framework for evaluating consistency in large language model (LLM) binary text classification, addressing the lack of established reliability assessment methods. Adapting psychometric principles, we determine sample size requirements, develop metrics for invalid responses, and evaluate intra- and inter-rater reliability. Our case study examines financial news sentiment classification across 14 LLMs (including claude-3-7-sonnet, gpt-4o, deepseek-r1, gemma3, llama3.2, phi4, and command-r-plus), with five replicates per model on 1,350 articles. Models demonstrated high intra-rater consistency, achieving perfect agreement on 90-98% of examples, with minimal differences between expensive and economical models from the same families. When validated against StockNewsAPI labels, models achieved strong performance (accuracy 0.76-0.88), with smaller models like gemma3:1B, llama3.2:3B, and claude-3-5-haiku outperforming larger counterparts. All models performed at chance when predicting actual market movements, indicating task constraints rather than model limitations. Our framework provides systematic guidance for LLM selection, sample size planning, and reliability assessment, enabling organizations to optimize resources for classification tasks.

# Too Long, Didn't Model: Decomposing LLM Long-Context Understanding With Novels 

**Authors**: Sil Hamilton, Rebecca M. M. Hicke, Matthew Wilkens, David Mimno  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14925)  

**Abstract**: Although the context length of large language models (LLMs) has increased to millions of tokens, evaluating their effectiveness beyond needle-in-a-haystack approaches has proven difficult. We argue that novels provide a case study of subtle, complicated structure and long-range semantic dependencies often over 128k tokens in length. Inspired by work on computational novel analysis, we release the Too Long, Didn't Model (TLDM) benchmark, which tests a model's ability to report plot summary, storyworld configuration, and elapsed narrative time. We find that none of seven tested frontier LLMs retain stable understanding beyond 64k tokens. Our results suggest language model developers must look beyond "lost in the middle" benchmarks when evaluating model performance in complex long-context scenarios. To aid in further development we release the TLDM benchmark together with reference code and data.

# DECASTE: Unveiling Caste Stereotypes in Large Language Models through Multi-Dimensional Bias Analysis 

**Authors**: Prashanth Vijayaraghavan, Soroush Vosoughi, Lamogha Chizor, Raya Horesh, Rogerio Abreu de Paula, Ehsan Degan, Vandana Mukherjee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14971)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and expanded their applications across diverse domains. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have been shown to reflect and perpetuate harmful societal biases, including those based on ethnicity, gender, and religion. A critical and underexplored issue is the reinforcement of caste-based biases, particularly towards India's marginalized caste groups such as Dalits and Shudras. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing DECASTE, a novel, multi-dimensional framework designed to detect and assess both implicit and explicit caste biases in LLMs. Our approach evaluates caste fairness across four dimensions: socio-cultural, economic, educational, and political, using a range of customized prompting strategies. By benchmarking several state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that these models systematically reinforce caste biases, with significant disparities observed in the treatment of oppressed versus dominant caste groups. For example, bias scores are notably elevated when comparing Dalits and Shudras with dominant caste groups, reflecting societal prejudices that persist in model outputs. These results expose the subtle yet pervasive caste biases in LLMs and emphasize the need for more comprehensive and inclusive bias evaluation methodologies that assess the potential risks of deploying such models in real-world contexts.

# EasyMath: A 0-shot Math Benchmark for SLMs 

**Authors**: Drishya Karki, Michiel Kamphuis, Angelecia Frey  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14852)  

**Abstract**: EasyMath is a compact benchmark for practical math reasoning in small language models. It covers thirteen categories, from basic arithmetic and order of operations to word problems, algebraic expressions, edge cases, and omits specialist topics. We tested 23 models (14M to 4B parameters) using exact, numerical, and symbolic checks on free-form answers in a zero-shot setting. Accuracy rises with size and training, chain-of-thought adds modest gains, and consistency improves at scale.

# ConspEmoLLM-v2: A robust and stable model to detect sentiment-transformed conspiracy theories 

**Authors**: Zhiwei Liu, Paul Thompson, Jiaqi Rong, Sophia Ananiadou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14917)  

**Abstract**: Despite the many benefits of large language models (LLMs), they can also cause harm, e.g., through automatic generation of misinformation, including conspiracy theories. Moreover, LLMs can also ''disguise'' conspiracy theories by altering characteristic textual features, e.g., by transforming their typically strong negative emotions into a more positive tone. Although several studies have proposed automated conspiracy theory detection methods, they are usually trained using human-authored text, whose features can vary from LLM-generated text. Furthermore, several conspiracy detection models, including the previously proposed ConspEmoLLM, rely heavily on the typical emotional features of human-authored conspiracy content. As such, intentionally disguised content may evade detection. To combat such issues, we firstly developed an augmented version of the ConDID conspiracy detection dataset, ConDID-v2, which supplements human-authored conspiracy tweets with versions rewritten by an LLM to reduce the negativity of their original sentiment. The quality of the rewritten tweets was verified by combining human and LLM-based assessment. We subsequently used ConDID-v2 to train ConspEmoLLM-v2, an enhanced version of ConspEmoLLM. Experimental results demonstrate that ConspEmoLLM-v2 retains or exceeds the performance of ConspEmoLLM on the original human-authored content in ConDID, and considerably outperforms both ConspEmoLLM and several other baselines when applied to sentiment-transformed tweets in ConDID-v2. The project will be available at this https URL.

# MAATS: A Multi-Agent Automated Translation System Based on MQM Evaluation 

**Authors**: Xi Wang, Jiaqian Hu, Safinah Ali  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14848)  

**Abstract**: We present MAATS, a Multi Agent Automated Translation System that leverages the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework as a fine-grained signal for error detection and refinement. MAATS employs multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a distinct MQM category (e.g., Accuracy, Fluency, Style, Terminology), followed by a synthesis agent that integrates the annotations to iteratively refine translations. This design contrasts with conventional single-agent methods that rely on self-correction.
Evaluated across diverse language pairs and Large Language Models (LLMs), MAATS outperforms zero-shot and single-agent baselines with statistically significant gains in both automatic metrics and human assessments. It excels particularly in semantic accuracy, locale adaptation, and linguistically distant language pairs. Qualitative analysis highlights its strengths in multi-layered error diagnosis, omission detection across perspectives, and context-aware refinement. By aligning modular agent roles with interpretable MQM dimensions, MAATS narrows the gap between black-box LLMs and human translation workflows, shifting focus from surface fluency to deeper semantic and contextual fidelity.

# WebNovelBench: Placing LLM Novelists on the Web Novel Distribution 

**Authors**: Leon Lin, Jun Zheng, Haidong Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14818)  

**Abstract**: Robustly evaluating the long-form storytelling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, as existing benchmarks often lack the necessary scale, diversity, or objective measures. To address this, we introduce WebNovelBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-form novel generation. WebNovelBench leverages a large-scale dataset of over 4,000 Chinese web novels, framing evaluation as a synopsis-to-story generation task. We propose a multi-faceted framework encompassing eight narrative quality dimensions, assessed automatically via an LLM-as-Judge approach. Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling abilities and offering insights for future development. This benchmark provides a scalable, replicable, and data-driven methodology for assessing and advancing LLM-driven narrative generation.

# Text Generation Beyond Discrete Token Sampling 

**Authors**: Yufan Zhuang, Liyuan Liu, Chandan Singh, Jingbo Shang, Jianfeng Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14827)  

**Abstract**: In standard autoregressive generation, an LLM predicts the next-token distribution, samples a discrete token, and then discards the distribution, passing only the sampled token as new input. To preserve this distribution's rich information, we propose Mixture of Inputs (MoI), a training-free method for autoregressive generation. After generating a token following the standard paradigm, we construct a new input that blends the generated discrete token with the previously discarded token distribution. Specifically, we employ a Bayesian estimation method that treats the token distribution as the prior, the sampled token as the observation, and replaces the conventional one-hot vector with the continuous posterior expectation as the new model input. MoI allows the model to maintain a richer internal representation throughout the generation process, resulting in improved text quality and reasoning capabilities. On mathematical reasoning, code generation, and PhD-level QA tasks, MoI consistently improves performance across multiple models including QwQ-32B, Nemotron-Super-49B, Gemma-3-27B, and DAPO-Qwen-32B, with no additional training and negligible computational overhead.

# Scaling Reasoning, Losing Control: Evaluating Instruction Following in Large Reasoning Models 

**Authors**: Tingchen Fu, Jiawei Gu, Yafu Li, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14810)  

**Abstract**: Instruction-following is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with user intent. While recent reasoning-oriented models exhibit impressive performance on complex mathematical problems, their ability to adhere to natural language instructions remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce MathIF, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating instruction-following in mathematical reasoning tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals a consistent tension between scaling up reasoning capacity and maintaining controllability, as models that reason more effectively often struggle to comply with user directives. We find that models tuned on distilled long chains-of-thought or trained with reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning often degrade in instruction adherence, especially when generation length increases. Furthermore, we show that even simple interventions can partially recover obedience, though at the cost of reasoning performance. These findings highlight a fundamental tension in current LLM training paradigms and motivate the need for more instruction-aware reasoning models. We release the code and data at this https URL.

# Large Language Models as Computable Approximations to Solomonoff Induction 

**Authors**: Jun Wan, Lingrui Mei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15784)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) calls for a rigorous theoretical framework to explain their empirical success. While significant progress has been made in understanding LLM behaviors, existing theoretical frameworks remain fragmented in explaining emergent phenomena through a unified mathematical lens. We establish the first formal connection between LLM architectures and Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) by proving two fundamental results: (1) the training process computationally approximates Solomonoff prior through loss minimization interpreted as program length optimization, and (2) next-token prediction implements approximate Solomonoff induction. We leverage AIT to provide a unified theoretical explanation for in-context learning, few-shot learning, and scaling laws. Furthermore, our theoretical insights lead to a principled method for few-shot example selection that prioritizes samples where models exhibit lower predictive confidence. We demonstrate through experiments on diverse text classification benchmarks that this strategy yields significant performance improvements, particularly for smaller model architectures, when compared to selecting high-confidence examples. Our framework bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical LLM behaviors, providing both explanatory power and actionable insights for future model development.

# MIKU-PAL: An Automated and Standardized Multi-Modal Method for Speech Paralinguistic and Affect Labeling 

**Authors**: Cheng Yifan, Zhang Ruoyi, Shi Jiatong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15772)  

**Abstract**: Acquiring large-scale emotional speech data with strong consistency remains a challenge for speech synthesis. This paper presents MIKU-PAL, a fully automated multimodal pipeline for extracting high-consistency emotional speech from unlabeled video data. Leveraging face detection and tracking algorithms, we developed an automatic emotion analysis system using a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our results demonstrate that MIKU-PAL can achieve human-level accuracy (68.5% on MELD) and superior consistency (0.93 Fleiss kappa score) while being much cheaper and faster than human annotation. With the high-quality, flexible, and consistent annotation from MIKU-PAL, we can annotate fine-grained speech emotion categories of up to 26 types, validated by human annotators with 83% rationality ratings. Based on our proposed system, we further released a fine-grained emotional speech dataset MIKU-EmoBench(131.2 hours) as a new benchmark for emotional text-to-speech and visual voice cloning.

# Scalable Defense against In-the-wild Jailbreaking Attacks with Safety Context Retrieval 

**Authors**: Taiye Chen, Zeming Wei, Ang Li, Yisen Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15753)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, wherein adversaries exploit carefully engineered prompts to induce harmful or unethical responses. Such threats have raised critical concerns about the safety and reliability of LLMs in real-world deployment. While existing defense mechanisms partially mitigate such risks, subsequent advancements in adversarial techniques have enabled novel jailbreaking methods to circumvent these protections, exposing the limitations of static defense frameworks. In this work, we explore defending against evolving jailbreaking threats through the lens of context retrieval. First, we conduct a preliminary study demonstrating that even a minimal set of safety-aligned examples against a particular jailbreak can significantly enhance robustness against this attack pattern. Building on this insight, we further leverage the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques and propose Safety Context Retrieval (SCR), a scalable and robust safeguarding paradigm for LLMs against jailbreaking. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate how SCR achieves superior defensive performance against both established and emerging jailbreaking tactics, contributing a new paradigm to LLM safety. Our code will be available upon publication.

# Evolutionary Computation and Large Language Models: A Survey of Methods, Synergies, and Applications 

**Authors**: Dikshit Chauhan, Bapi Dutta, Indu Bala, Niki van Stein, Thomas Bäck, Anupam Yadav  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15741)  

**Abstract**: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) represents a promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence by combining powerful natural language understanding with optimization and search capabilities. This manuscript explores the synergistic potential of LLMs and EC, reviewing their intersections, complementary strengths, and emerging applications. We identify key opportunities where EC can enhance LLM training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and architecture search, while LLMs can, in turn, aid in automating the design, analysis, and interpretation of ECs. The manuscript explores the synergistic integration of EC and LLMs, highlighting their bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It first examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search, demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes. Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive heuristics, thereby increasing efficiency and scalability. Emerging co-evolutionary frameworks are discussed, showcasing applications across diverse fields while acknowledging challenges like computational costs, interpretability, and algorithmic convergence. The survey concludes by identifying open research questions and advocating for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of EC and LLMs.

# Alignment Under Pressure: The Case for Informed Adversaries When Evaluating LLM Defenses 

**Authors**: Xiaoxue Yang, Bozhidar Stevanoski, Matthieu Meeus, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15738)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly deployed in real-world applications ranging from chatbots to agentic systems. Alignment is one of the main approaches used to defend against attacks such as prompt injection and jailbreaks. Recent defenses report near-zero Attack Success Rates (ASR) even against Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), a white-box attack that generates adversarial suffixes to induce attacker-desired outputs. However, this search space over discrete tokens is extremely large, making the task of finding successful attacks difficult. GCG has, for instance, been shown to converge to local minima, making it sensitive to initialization choices. In this paper, we assess the future-proof robustness of these defenses using a more informed threat model: attackers who have access to some information about the alignment process. Specifically, we propose an informed white-box attack leveraging the intermediate model checkpoints to initialize GCG, with each checkpoint acting as a stepping stone for the next one. We show this approach to be highly effective across state-of-the-art (SOTA) defenses and models. We further show our informed initialization to outperform other initialization methods and show a gradient-informed checkpoint selection strategy to greatly improve attack performance and efficiency. Importantly, we also show our method to successfully find universal adversarial suffixes -- single suffixes effective across diverse inputs. Our results show that, contrary to previous beliefs, effective adversarial suffixes do exist against SOTA alignment-based defenses, that these can be found by existing attack methods when adversaries exploit alignment knowledge, and that even universal suffixes exist. Taken together, our results highlight the brittleness of current alignment-based methods and the need to consider stronger threat models when testing the safety of LLMs.

# Set-LLM: A Permutation-Invariant LLM 

**Authors**: Beni Egressy, Jan Stühmer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15433)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across numerous applications, their robustness remains a critical concern. This paper is motivated by a specific vulnerability: the order sensitivity of LLMs. This vulnerability manifests itself as the order bias observed when LLMs decide between possible options (for example, a preference for the first option) and the tendency of LLMs to provide different answers when options are reordered. The use cases for this scenario extend beyond the classical case of multiple-choice question answering to the use of LLMs as automated evaluators in AI pipelines, comparing output generated by different models. We introduce Set-LLM, a novel architectural adaptation for pretrained LLMs that enables the processing of mixed set-text inputs with permutation invariance guarantees. The adaptations involve a new attention mask and new positional encodings specifically designed for sets. We provide a theoretical proof of invariance and demonstrate through experiments that Set-LLM can be trained effectively, achieving comparable or improved performance and maintaining the runtime of the original model, while eliminating order sensitivity.

# AI vs. Human Judgment of Content Moderation: LLM-as-a-Judge and Ethics-Based Response Refusals 

**Authors**: Stefan Pasch  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15365)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can't help with that because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system limitations (e.g., "I can't answer because I lack real-time data"). We find that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals. We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do. This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.

# HDLxGraph: Bridging Large Language Models and HDL Repositories via HDL Graph Databases 

**Authors**: Pingqing Zheng, Jiayin Qin, Fuqi Zhang, Shang Wu, Yu Cao, Caiwen Ding, Yang, Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15701)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential in hardware design tasks, such as Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation and debugging. Yet, their performance in real-world, repository-level HDL projects with thousands or even tens of thousands of code lines is hindered. To this end, we propose HDLxGraph, a novel framework that integrates Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) with LLMs, introducing HDL-specific graph representations by incorporating Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs) to capture both code graph view and hardware graph view. HDLxGraph utilizes a dual-retrieval mechanism that not only mitigates the limited recall issues inherent in similarity-based semantic retrieval by incorporating structural information, but also enhances its extensibility to various real-world tasks by a task-specific retrieval finetuning. Additionally, to address the lack of comprehensive HDL search benchmarks, we introduce HDLSearch, a multi-granularity evaluation dataset derived from real-world repository-level projects. Experimental results demonstrate that HDLxGraph significantly improves average search accuracy, debugging efficiency and completion quality by 12.04%, 12.22% and 5.04% compared to similarity-based RAG, respectively. The code of HDLxGraph and collected HDLSearch benchmark are available at this https URL.

# When to Continue Thinking: Adaptive Thinking Mode Switching for Efficient Reasoning 

**Authors**: Xiaoyun Zhang, Jingqing Ruan, Xing Ma, Yawen Zhu, Haodong Zhao, Hao Li, Jiansong Chen, Ke Zeng, Xunliang Cai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15400)  

**Abstract**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve remarkable performance via long reasoning chains, but often incur excessive computational overhead due to redundant reasoning, especially on simple tasks. In this work, we systematically quantify the upper bounds of LRMs under both Long-Thinking and No-Thinking modes, and uncover the phenomenon of "Internal Self-Recovery Mechanism" where models implicitly supplement reasoning during answer generation. Building on this insight, we propose Adaptive Self-Recovery Reasoning (ASRR), a framework that suppresses unnecessary reasoning and enables implicit recovery. By introducing accuracy-aware length reward regulation, ASRR adaptively allocates reasoning effort according to problem difficulty, achieving high efficiency with negligible performance sacrifice. Experiments across multiple benchmarks and models show that, compared with GRPO, ASRR reduces reasoning budget by up to 32.5% (1.5B) and 25.7% (7B) with minimal accuracy loss (1.2% and 0.6% pass@1), and significantly boosts harmless rates on safety benchmarks (up to +21.7%). Our results highlight the potential of ASRR for enabling efficient, adaptive, and safer reasoning in LRMs.

# ClickSight: Interpreting Student Clickstreams to Reveal Insights on Learning Strategies via LLMs 

**Authors**: Bahar Radmehr, Ekaterina Shved, Fatma Betül Güreş, Adish Singla, Tanja Käser  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15410)  

**Abstract**: Clickstream data from digital learning environments offer valuable insights into students' learning behaviors, but are challenging to interpret due to their high dimensionality and granularity. Prior approaches have relied mainly on handcrafted features, expert labeling, clustering, or supervised models, therefore often lacking generalizability and scalability. In this work, we introduce ClickSight, an in-context Large Language Model (LLM)-based pipeline that interprets student clickstreams to reveal their learning strategies. ClickSight takes raw clickstreams and a list of learning strategies as input and generates textual interpretations of students' behaviors during interaction. We evaluate four different prompting strategies and investigate the impact of self-refinement on interpretation quality. Our evaluation spans two open-ended learning environments and uses a rubric-based domain-expert evaluation. Results show that while LLMs can reasonably interpret learning strategies from clickstreams, interpretation quality varies by prompting strategy, and self-refinement offers limited improvement. ClickSight demonstrates the potential of LLMs to generate theory-driven insights from educational interaction data.

# When Can Large Reasoning Models Save Thinking? Mechanistic Analysis of Behavioral Divergence in Reasoning 

**Authors**: Rongzhi Zhu, Yi Liu, Zequn Sun, Yiwei Wang, Wei Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15276)  

**Abstract**: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have significantly advanced performance on complex tasks, yet their tendency to overthink introduces inefficiencies. This study investigates the internal mechanisms of reinforcement learning (RL)-trained LRMs when prompted to save thinking, revealing three distinct thinking modes: no thinking (NT), explicit thinking (ET), and implicit thinking (IT). Through comprehensive analysis of confidence in thinking termination, attention from thinking to generation, and attentional focus on input sections, we uncover key factors influencing the reasoning behaviors. We further find that NT reduces output length at the cost of accuracy, while ET and IT maintain accuracy with reduced response length. Our findings expose fundamental inconsistencies in RL-optimized LRMs, necessitating adaptive improvements for reliable efficiency.

# ReGUIDE: Data Efficient GUI Grounding via Spatial Reasoning and Search 

**Authors**: Hyunseok Lee, Jeonghoon Kim, Beomjun Kim, Jihoon Tack, Chansong Jo, Jaehong Lee, Cheonbok Park, Sookyo In, Jinwoo Shin, Kang Min Yoo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15259)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled autonomous agents to interact with computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), where accurately localizing the coordinates of interface elements (e.g., buttons) is often required for fine-grained actions. However, this remains significantly challenging, leading prior works to rely on large-scale web datasets to improve the grounding accuracy. In this work, we propose Reasoning Graphical User Interface Grounding for Data Efficiency (ReGUIDE), a novel and effective framework for web grounding that enables MLLMs to learn data efficiently through self-generated reasoning and spatial-aware criticism. More specifically, ReGUIDE learns to (i) self-generate a language reasoning process for the localization via online reinforcement learning, and (ii) criticize the prediction using spatial priors that enforce equivariance under input transformations. At inference time, ReGUIDE further boosts performance through a test-time scaling strategy, which combines spatial search with coordinate aggregation. Our experiments demonstrate that ReGUIDE significantly advances web grounding performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming baselines with substantially fewer training data points (e.g., only 0.2% samples compared to the best open-sourced baselines).

# ALN-P3: Unified Language Alignment for Perception, Prediction, and Planning in Autonomous Driving 

**Authors**: Yunsheng Ma, Burhaneddin Yaman, Xin Ye, Mahmut Yurt, Jingru Luo, Abhirup Mallik, Ziran Wang, Liu Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15158)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances have explored integrating large language models (LLMs) into end-to-end autonomous driving systems to enhance generalization and interpretability. However, most existing approaches are limited to either driving performance or vision-language reasoning, making it difficult to achieve both simultaneously. In this paper, we propose ALN-P3, a unified co-distillation framework that introduces cross-modal alignment between "fast" vision-based autonomous driving systems and "slow" language-driven reasoning modules. ALN-P3 incorporates three novel alignment mechanisms: Perception Alignment (P1A), Prediction Alignment (P2A), and Planning Alignment (P3A), which explicitly align visual tokens with corresponding linguistic outputs across the full perception, prediction, and planning stack. All alignment modules are applied only during training and incur no additional costs during inference. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmarks-nuScenes, Nu-X, TOD3Cap, and nuScenes QA-demonstrate that ALN-P3 significantly improves both driving decisions and language reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.

# ModelingAgent: Bridging LLMs and Mathematical Modeling for Real-World Challenges 

**Authors**: Cheng Qian, Hongyi Du, Hongru Wang, Xiusi Chen, Yuji Zhang, Avirup Sil, Chengxiang Zhai, Kathleen McKeown, Heng Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15068)  

**Abstract**: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled substantial advances in solving mathematical problems. However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.

# RL Tango: Reinforcing Generator and Verifier Together for Language Reasoning 

**Authors**: Kaiwen Zha, Zhengqi Gao, Maohao Shen, Zhang-Wei Hong, Duane S. Boning, Dina Katabi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15034)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a compelling approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), where an LLM generator serves as a policy guided by a verifier (reward model). However, current RL post-training methods for LLMs typically use verifiers that are fixed (rule-based or frozen pretrained) or trained discriminatively via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset. Remarkably, both components exhibit particularly substantial improvements on the most difficult mathematical reasoning problems. Code is at: this https URL.

# Learning to Rank Chain-of-Thought: An Energy-Based Approach with Outcome Supervision 

**Authors**: Eric Hanchen Jiang, Haozheng Luo, Shengyuan Pang, Xiaomin Li, Zhenting Qi, Hengli Li, Cheng-Fu Yang, Zongyu Lin, Xinfeng Li, Hao Xu, Kai-Wei Chang, Ying Nian Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14999)  

**Abstract**: Mathematical reasoning presents a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs), often requiring robust multi step logical consistency. While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting elicits reasoning steps, it doesn't guarantee correctness, and improving reliability via extensive sampling is computationally costly. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), an effective, lightweight, post hoc verifier. EORM leverages Energy Based Models (EBMs) to simplify the training of reward models by learning to assign a scalar energy score to CoT solutions using only outcome labels, thereby avoiding detailed annotations. It achieves this by interpreting discriminator output logits as negative energies, effectively ranking candidates where lower energy is assigned to solutions leading to correct final outcomes implicitly favoring coherent reasoning. On mathematical benchmarks (GSM8k, MATH), EORM significantly improves final answer accuracy (e.g., with Llama 3 8B, achieving 90.7% on GSM8k and 63.7% on MATH). EORM effectively leverages a given pool of candidate solutions to match or exceed the performance of brute force sampling, thereby enhancing LLM reasoning outcome reliability through its streamlined post hoc verification process.

# Think, Reflect, Create: Metacognitive Learning for Zero-Shot Robotic Planning with LLMs 

**Authors**: Wenjie Lin, Jin Wei-Kocsis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14899)  

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential across various domains, their applications in robotics remain largely limited to static, prompt-based behaviors and still face challenges in handling complex tasks under zero-shot or few-shot settings. Inspired by human metacognitive learning and creative problem-solving, we address this limitation by exploring a fundamental research question: Can LLMs be empowered with metacognitive capabilities to reason, reflect, and create, thereby enhancing their ability to perform robotic tasks with minimal demonstrations? In this paper, we present an early-stage framework that integrates metacognitive learning into LLM-powered multi-robot collaboration. The proposed framework equips the LLM-powered robotic agents with a skill decomposition and self-reflection mechanism that identifies modular skills from prior tasks, reflects on failures in unseen task scenarios, and synthesizes effective new solutions. Experimental results show that our metacognitive-learning-empowered LLM framework significantly outperforms existing baselines. Moreover, we observe that the framework is capable of generating solutions that differ from the ground truth yet still successfully complete the tasks. These exciting findings support our hypothesis that metacognitive learning can foster creativity in robotic planning.

# Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization: A Simple Value-Based Method for LLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Yurun Yuan, Fan Chen, Zeyu Jia, Alexander Rakhlin, Tengyang Xie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15311)  

**Abstract**: Policy-based methods currently dominate reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines for large language model (LLM) reasoning, leaving value-based approaches largely unexplored. We revisit the classical paradigm of Bellman Residual Minimization and introduce Trajectory Bellman Residual Minimization (TBRM), an algorithm that naturally adapts this idea to LLMs, yielding a simple yet effective off-policy algorithm that optimizes a single trajectory-level Bellman objective using the model's own logits as $Q$-values. TBRM removes the need for critics, importance-sampling ratios, or clipping, and operates with only one rollout per prompt. We prove convergence to the near-optimal KL-regularized policy from arbitrary off-policy data via an improved change-of-trajectory-measure analysis. Experiments on standard mathematical-reasoning benchmarks show that TBRM consistently outperforms policy-based baselines, like PPO and GRPO, with comparable or lower computational and memory overhead. Our results indicate that value-based RL might be a principled and efficient alternative for enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

# Generalised Probabilistic Modelling and Improved Uncertainty Estimation in Comparative LLM-as-a-judge 

**Authors**: Yassir Fathullah, Mark J. F. Gales  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15240)  

**Abstract**: This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering, significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.

# lmgame-Bench: How Good are LLMs at Playing Games? 

**Authors**: Lanxiang Hu, Mingjia Huo, Yuxuan Zhang, Haoyang Yu, Eric P. Xing, Ion Stoica, Tajana Rosing, Haojian Jin, Hao Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15146)  

**Abstract**: Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at this https URL.

# Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Xiaoyin Chen, Jiarui Lu, Minsu Kim, Dinghuai Zhang, Jian Tang, Alexandre Piché, Nicolas Gontier, Yoshua Bengio, Ehsan Kamalloo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14970)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.

# FOL-Pretrain: A complexity annotated corpus of first-order logic 

**Authors**: Isabelle Lee, Sarah Liaw, Dani Yogatama  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14932)  

**Abstract**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities such as coding and solving mathematical problems to commonsense inference. While these tasks vary in complexity, they all require models to integrate and compute over structured information. Despite recent efforts to reverse-engineer LLM behavior through controlled experiments, our understanding of how these models internalize and execute complex algorithms remains limited. Progress has largely been confined to small-scale studies or shallow tasks such as basic arithmetic and grammatical pattern matching. One barrier to deeper understanding is the nature of pretraining data -- vast, heterogeneous, and often poorly annotated, making it difficult to isolate mechanisms of reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale, fully open, complexity-annotated dataset of first-order logic reasoning traces, designed to probe and analyze algorithmic reasoning in LLMs. The dataset consists of 3.5 billion tokens, including 8.8 million LLM-augmented, human-annotated examples and 7.5 million synthetically generated examples. Each synthetic example is verifiably correct, produced by a custom automated theorem solver, and accompanied by metadata tracing its algorithmic provenance. We aim to provide a scalable, interpretable artifact for studying how LLMs learn and generalize symbolic reasoning processes, paving the way for more transparent and targeted investigations into the algorithmic capabilities of modern models.

# Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback 

**Authors**: Eric Han, Jun Chen, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Xiaoliang Peng, Tengyu Xu, Eryk Helenowski, Kaiyan Peng, Mrinal Kumar, Sinong Wang, Han Fang, Arya Talebzadeh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14946)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in diverse user facing applications, aligning them with real user preferences becomes essential. Existing methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) rely on expert annotators trained on manually defined guidelines, whose judgments may not reflect the priorities of everyday users. We introduce Reinforcement Learning from User Feedback (RLUF), a framework for aligning LLMs directly to implicit signals from users in production. RLUF addresses key challenges of user feedback: user feedback is often binary (e.g., emoji reactions), sparse, and occasionally adversarial. We train a reward model, P[Love], to predict the likelihood that an LLM response will receive a Love Reaction, a lightweight form of positive user feedback, and integrate P[Love] into a multi-objective policy optimization framework alongside helpfulness and safety objectives. In large-scale experiments, we show that P[Love] is predictive of increased positive feedback and serves as a reliable offline evaluator of future user behavior. Policy optimization using P[Love] significantly raises observed positive-feedback rates, including a 28% increase in Love Reactions during live A/B tests. However, optimizing for positive reactions introduces reward hacking challenges, requiring careful balancing of objectives. By directly leveraging implicit signals from users, RLUF offers a path to aligning LLMs with real-world user preferences at scale.

**Authors**: Kanan Kiguchi, Yunhao Tu, Katsuhiro Ajito, Fady Alnajjar, Kazuyuki Murase  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15747)  

**Abstract**: We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. While traditional multimodal analysis requires matched patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%). The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review (Cohen's k=0.82) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching, offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.

# HybridProver: Augmenting Theorem Proving with LLM-Driven Proof Synthesis and Refinement 

**Authors**: Jilin Hu, Jianyu Zhang, Yongwang Zhao, Talia Ringer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15740)  

**Abstract**: Formal methods is pivotal for verifying the reliability of critical systems through rigorous mathematical proofs. However, its adoption is hindered by labor-intensive manual proofs and the expertise required to use theorem provers. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for automated theorem proving. Two promising approaches are generating tactics step by step and generating a whole proof directly with an LLM. However, existing work makes no attempt to combine the two approaches. In this work, we introduce HybridProver, a dual-model proof synthesis framework that combines tactic-based generation and whole-proof synthesis to harness the benefits of both approaches. HybridProver generates whole proof candidates for evaluation directly, then extracts proof sketches from those candidates. It then uses a tactic-based generation model that integrates automated tools to complete the sketches via stepwise refinement. We implement HybridProver for the Isabelle theorem prover and fine-tune LLMs on our optimized Isabelle datasets. Evaluation on the miniF2F dataset illustrates HybridProver's effectiveness. We achieve a 59.4% success rate on miniF2F, where the previous SOTA is 56.1%. Our ablation studies show that this SOTA result is attributable to combining whole-proof and tactic-based generation. Additionally, we show how the dataset quality, training parameters, and sampling diversity affect the final result during automated theorem proving with LLMs. All of our code, datasets, and LLMs are open source.

# Exploring LLM-Generated Feedback for Economics Essays: How Teaching Assistants Evaluate and Envision Its Use 

**Authors**: Xinyi Lu, Aditya Mahesh, Zejia Shen, Mitchell Dudley, Larissa Sano, Xu Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15596)  

**Abstract**: This project examines the prospect of using AI-generated feedback as suggestions to expedite and enhance human instructors' feedback provision. In particular, we focus on understanding the teaching assistants' perspectives on the quality of AI-generated feedback and how they may or may not utilize AI feedback in their own workflows. We situate our work in a foundational college Economics class, which has frequent short essay assignments. We developed an LLM-powered feedback engine that generates feedback on students' essays based on grading rubrics used by the teaching assistants (TAs). To ensure that TAs can meaningfully critique and engage with the AI feedback, we had them complete their regular grading jobs. For a randomly selected set of essays that they had graded, we used our feedback engine to generate feedback and displayed the feedback as in-text comments in a Word document. We then performed think-aloud studies with 5 TAs over 20 1-hour sessions to have them evaluate the AI feedback, contrast the AI feedback with their handwritten feedback, and share how they envision using the AI feedback if they were offered as suggestions. The study highlights the importance of providing detailed rubrics for AI to generate high-quality feedback for knowledge-intensive essays. TAs considered that using AI feedback as suggestions during their grading could expedite grading, enhance consistency, and improve overall feedback quality. We discuss the importance of decomposing the feedback generation task into steps and presenting intermediate results, in order for TAs to use the AI feedback.

# LLM-Explorer: A Plug-in Reinforcement Learning Policy Exploration Enhancement Driven by Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Qianyue Hao, Yiwen Song, Qingmin Liao, Jian Yuan, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15293)  

**Abstract**: Policy exploration is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), where existing approaches include greedy, Gaussian process, etc. However, these approaches utilize preset stochastic processes and are indiscriminately applied in all kinds of RL tasks without considering task-specific features that influence policy exploration. Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%. Our code is open-source at this https URL for reproducibility.

# Blind Spot Navigation: Evolutionary Discovery of Sensitive Semantic Concepts for LVLMs 

**Authors**: Zihao Pan, Yu Tong, Weibin Wu, Jingyi Wang, Lifeng Chen, Zhe Zhao, Jiajia Wei, Yitong Qiao, Zibin Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15265)  

**Abstract**: Adversarial attacks aim to generate malicious inputs that mislead deep models, but beyond causing model failure, they cannot provide certain interpretable information such as ``\textit{What content in inputs make models more likely to fail?}'' However, this information is crucial for researchers to specifically improve model robustness. Recent research suggests that models may be particularly sensitive to certain semantics in visual inputs (such as ``wet,'' ``foggy''), making them prone to errors. Inspired by this, in this paper we conducted the first exploration on large vision-language models (LVLMs) and found that LVLMs indeed are susceptible to hallucinations and various errors when facing specific semantic concepts in images. To efficiently search for these sensitive concepts, we integrated large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) models to propose a novel semantic evolution framework. Randomly initialized semantic concepts undergo LLM-based crossover and mutation operations to form image descriptions, which are then converted by T2I models into visual inputs for LVLMs. The task-specific performance of LVLMs on each input is quantified as fitness scores for the involved semantics and serves as reward signals to further guide LLMs in exploring concepts that induce LVLMs. Extensive experiments on seven mainstream LVLMs and two multimodal tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we provide interesting findings about the sensitive semantics of LVLMs, aiming to inspire further in-depth research.

# Multiple Weaks Win Single Strong: Large Language Models Ensemble Weak Reinforcement Learning Agents into a Supreme One 

**Authors**: Yiwen Song, Qianyue Hao, Qingmin Liao, Jian Yuan, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15306)  

**Abstract**: Model ensemble is a useful approach in reinforcement learning (RL) for training effective agents. Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%. For reproducibility, our code is open-source at this https URL.

# The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Entropy Minimization in LLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Shivam Agarwal, Zimin Zhang, Lifan Yuan, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15134)  

**Abstract**: Entropy minimization (EM) trains the model to concentrate even more probability mass on its most confident outputs. We show that this simple objective alone, without any labeled data, can substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) performance on challenging math, physics, and coding tasks. We explore three approaches: (1) EM-FT minimizes token-level entropy similarly to instruction finetuning, but on unlabeled outputs drawn from the model; (2) EM-RL: reinforcement learning with negative entropy as the only reward to maximize; (3) EM-INF: inference-time logit adjustment to reduce entropy without any training data or parameter updates. On Qwen-7B, EM-RL, without any labeled data, achieves comparable or better performance than strong RL baselines such as GRPO and RLOO that are trained on 60K labeled examples. Furthermore, EM-INF enables Qwen-32B to match or exceed the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro on the challenging SciCode benchmark, while being 3x more efficient than self-consistency and sequential refinement. Our findings reveal that many pretrained LLMs possess previously underappreciated reasoning capabilities that can be effectively elicited through entropy minimization alone, without any labeled data or even any parameter updates.

# Adaptive Plan-Execute Framework for Smart Contract Security Auditing 

**Authors**: Zhiyuan Wei, Jing Sun, Zijian Zhang, Zhe Hou, Zixiao Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15242)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in code analysis and auditing; however, they still struggle with hallucinations and limited context-aware reasoning. We introduce SmartAuditFlow, a novel Plan-Execute framework that enhances smart contract security analysis through dynamic audit planning and structured execution. Unlike conventional LLM-based auditing approaches that follow fixed workflows and predefined steps, SmartAuditFlow dynamically generates and refines audit plans based on the unique characteristics of each smart contract. It continuously adjusts its auditing strategy in response to intermediate LLM outputs and newly detected vulnerabilities, ensuring a more adaptive and precise security assessment. The framework then executes these plans step by step, applying a structured reasoning process to enhance vulnerability detection accuracy while minimizing hallucinations and false positives. To further improve audit precision, SmartAuditFlow integrates iterative prompt optimization and external knowledge sources, such as static analysis tools and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This ensures audit decisions are contextually informed and backed by real-world security knowledge, producing comprehensive security reports. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SmartAuditFlow outperforms existing methods, achieving 100 percent accuracy on common and critical vulnerabilities, 41.2 percent accuracy for comprehensive coverage of known smart contract weaknesses in real-world projects, and successfully identifying all 13 tested CVEs. These results highlight SmartAuditFlow's scalability, cost-effectiveness, and superior adaptability over traditional static analysis tools and contemporary LLM-based approaches, establishing it as a robust solution for automated smart contract auditing.

# ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM 

**Authors**: Qihang Yu, Kairui Fu, Shengyu Zhang, Zheqi Lv, Fan Wu, Fei Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15091)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available in anonymous Github: this https URL.

# AsynFusion: Towards Asynchronous Latent Consistency Models for Decoupled Whole-Body Audio-Driven Avatars 

**Authors**: Tianbao Zhang, Jian Zhao, Yuer Li, Zheng Zhu, Ping Hu, Zhaoxin Fan, Wenjun Wu, Xuelong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15058)  

**Abstract**: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality, digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

# PiFlow: Principle-aware Scientific Discovery with Multi-Agent Collaboration 

**Authors**: Yingming Pu, Tao Lin, Hongyu Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15047)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery. Existing approaches, however, often automate scientific discovery using predefined workflows that lack rationality constraints. This often leads to aimless hypothesizing and a failure to consistently link hypotheses with evidence, thereby hindering systematic uncertainty reduction. Overcoming these limitations fundamentally requires systematic uncertainty reduction. We introduce \texttt{PiFlow}, an information-theoretical framework, treating automated scientific discovery as a structured uncertainty reduction problem guided by principles (e.g., scientific laws). In evaluations across three distinct scientific domains -- discovering nanomaterial structures, bio-molecules, and superconductor candidates with targeted properties -- our method significantly improves discovery efficiency, reflected by a 73.55\% increase in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of property values versus exploration steps, and enhances solution quality by 94.06\% compared to a vanilla agent system. Overall, \texttt{PiFlow} serves as a Plug-and-Play method, establishing a novel paradigm shift in highly efficient automated scientific discovery, paving the way for more robust and accelerated AI-driven research. Code is publicly available at our \href{this https URL}{GitHub}.

**Authors**: Yuxuan Wang, Jingshu Chen, Qingyang Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15088)  

**Abstract**: Command injection vulnerabilities are a significant security threat in dynamic languages like Python, particularly in widely used open-source projects where security issues can have extensive impact. With the proven effectiveness of Large Language Models(LLMs) in code-related tasks, such as testing, researchers have explored their potential for vulnerabilities analysis. This study evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, as an alternative approach for automated testing for vulnerability detection. In particular, LLMs have demonstrated advanced contextual understanding and adaptability, making them promising candidates for identifying nuanced security vulnerabilities within code. To evaluate this potential, we applied LLM-based analysis to six high-profile GitHub projects-Django, Flask, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and Langchain-each with over 50,000 stars and extensive adoption across software development and academic research. Our analysis assesses both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in detecting command injection vulnerabilities, evaluating factors such as detection accuracy, efficiency, and practical integration into development workflows. In addition, we provide a comparative analysis of different LLM tools to identify those most suitable for security applications. Our findings offer guidance for developers and security researchers on leveraging LLMs as innovative and automated approaches to enhance software security.

# Programmatic Video Prediction Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Hao Tang, Kevin Ellis, Suhas Lohit, Michael J. Jones, Moitreya Chatterjee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14948)  

**Abstract**: The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.

# Polar Sparsity: High Throughput Batched LLM Inferencing with Scalable Contextual Sparsity 

**Authors**: Susav Shrestha, Brad Settlemyer, Nikoli Dryden, Narasimha Reddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14884)  

**Abstract**: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: this https URL.

# $\texttt{LLINBO}$: Trustworthy LLM-in-the-Loop Bayesian Optimization 

**Authors**: Chih-Yu Chang, Milad Azvar, Chinedum Okwudire, Raed Al Kontar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14756)  

**Abstract**: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sequential decision-making tool widely used for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable adaptability in low-data regimes, making them promising tools for black-box optimization by leveraging contextual knowledge to propose high-quality query points. However, relying solely on LLMs as optimization agents introduces risks due to their lack of explicit surrogate modeling and calibrated uncertainty, as well as their inherently opaque internal mechanisms. This structural opacity makes it difficult to characterize or control the exploration-exploitation trade-off, ultimately undermining theoretical tractability and reliability. To address this, we propose LLINBO: LLM-in-the-Loop BO, a hybrid framework for BO that combines LLMs with statistical surrogate experts (e.g., Gaussian Processes (GP)). The core philosophy is to leverage contextual reasoning strengths of LLMs for early exploration, while relying on principled statistical models to guide efficient exploitation. Specifically, we introduce three mechanisms that enable this collaboration and establish their theoretical guarantees. We end the paper with a real-life proof-of-concept in the context of 3D printing. The code to reproduce the results can be found at this https URL.

# The Energy Cost of Reasoning: Analyzing Energy Usage in LLMs with Test-time Compute 

**Authors**: Yunho Jin, Gu-Yeon Wei, David Brooks  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14733)  

**Abstract**: Scaling large language models (LLMs) has driven significant advancements, yet it faces diminishing returns and escalating energy demands. This work introduces test-time compute (TTC)-allocating additional computational resources during inference-as a compelling complement to conventional scaling strategies. Specifically, we investigate whether employing TTC can achieve superior accuracy-energy trade-offs compared to simply increasing model size. Our empirical analysis reveals that TTC surpasses traditional model scaling in accuracy/energy efficiency, with notable gains in tasks demanding complex reasoning rather than mere factual recall. Further, we identify a critical interaction between TTC performance and output sequence length, demonstrating that strategically adjusting compute resources at inference time according to query complexity can substantially enhance efficiency. Our findings advocate for TTC as a promising direction, enabling more sustainable, accurate, and adaptable deployment of future language models without incurring additional pretraining costs.

# CRAFT: Training-Free Cascaded Retrieval for Tabular QA 

**Authors**: Adarsh Singh, Kushal Raj Bhandari, Jianxi Gao, Soham Dan, Vivek Gupta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14984)  

**Abstract**: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models (LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate $\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.
