In this paper, we first conduct extensive analysis experiments of three key components of that training pipeline: input design, output evaluation, and policy update-each revealing distinct challenges arising from blindly applying general-purpose RL without adapting to GUI grounding tasks. Input design: Current templates encourage the model to generate chain-of-thought reasoning, but longer chains unexpectedly lead to worse grounding performance. Output evaluation: Reward functions based on hit signals or box area allow models to exploit box size, leading to reward hacking and poor localization quality. Policy update: Online RL tends to overfit easy examples due to biases in length and sample difficulty, leading to under-optimization on harder cases. To address these issues, we propose three targeted solutions. First, we adopt a Fast Thinking Template that encourages direct answer generation, reducing excessive reasoning during training. Second, we incorporate a box size constraint into the reward function to mitigate reward hacking. Third, we revise the RL objective by adjusting length normalization and adding a difficulty-aware scaling factor, enabling better optimization on hard samples. Our GUI-G1-3B, trained on 17K public samples with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, achieves 90.3% accuracy on ScreenSpot and 37.1% on ScreenSpot-Pro. This surpasses all prior models of similar size and even outperforms the larger UI-TARS-7B, establishing a new state-of-the-art in GUI agent grounding.

Such designs are susceptible to reward hacking and generalize poorly beyond their training distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Tango, a novel framework that uses RL to concurrently train both an LLM generator and a verifier in an interleaved manner. A central innovation of Tango is its generative, process-level LLM verifier, which is trained via RL and co-evolves with the generator. Importantly, the verifier is trained solely based on outcome-level verification correctness rewards without requiring explicit process-level annotations. This generative RL-trained verifier exhibits improved robustness and superior generalization compared to deterministic or SFT-trained verifiers, fostering effective mutual reinforcement with the generator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both components of Tango achieve state-of-the-art results among 7B/8B-scale models: the generator attains best-in-class performance across five competition-level math benchmarks and four challenging out-of-domain reasoning tasks, while the verifier leads on the ProcessBench dataset.

This constitutes a paradigm shift from the predominant setting of safety-shielding -- i.e., ensuring that nothing bad ever happens -- to a shielding process that additionally enforces liveness -- i.e., ensures that something good eventually happens. At the core, our method uses Strategy-Template-based Adaptive Runtime Shields (STARs), which leverage permissive strategy templates to enable post-shielding with minimal interference. As its main feature, STARs introduce a mechanism to dynamically control interference, allowing a tunable enforcement parameter to balance formal obligations and task-specific behavior at runtime. This allows to trigger more aggressive enforcement when needed, while allowing for optimized policy choices otherwise. In addition, STARs support runtime adaptation to changing specifications or actuator failures, making them especially suited for cyber-physical applications. We evaluate STARs on a mobile robot benchmark to demonstrate their controllable interference when enforcing (incrementally updated) $\\omega$-regular correctness properties over learned probabilistic policies.'}

While additional information, such as that available in simulations, can enhance training, effectively leveraging it remains an open problem. To address this, we introduce Guided Policy Optimization (GPO), a framework that co-trains a guider and a learner. The guider takes advantage of privileged information while ensuring alignment with the learner's policy that is primarily trained via imitation learning. We theoretically demonstrate that this learning scheme achieves optimality comparable to direct RL, thereby overcoming key limitations inherent in existing approaches. Empirical evaluations show strong performance of GPO across various tasks, including continuous control with partial observability and noise, and memory-based challenges, significantly outperforming existing methods."}

Despite wide success of RL, training effective agents remains difficult due to the multitude of factors requiring careful tuning, such as algorithm selection, hyperparameter settings, and even random seed choices, all of which can significantly influence an agent's performance. Model ensemble helps overcome this challenge by combining multiple weak agents into a single, more powerful one, enhancing overall performance. However, existing ensemble methods, such as majority voting and Boltzmann addition, are designed as fixed strategies and lack a semantic understanding of specific tasks, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness. To address this, we propose LLM-Ens, a novel approach that enhances RL model ensemble with task-specific semantic understandings driven by large language models (LLMs). Given a task, we first design an LLM to categorize states in this task into distinct 'situations', incorporating high-level descriptions of the task conditions. Then, we statistically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each individual agent to be used in the ensemble in each situation. During the inference time, LLM-Ens dynamically identifies the changing task situation and switches to the agent that performs best in the current situation, ensuring dynamic model selection in the evolving task condition. Our approach is designed to be compatible with agents trained with different random seeds, hyperparameter settings, and various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the Atari benchmark show that LLM-Ens significantly improves the RL model ensemble, surpassing well-known baselines by up to 20.9%.

Moreover, during RL training, the evolution of such stochastic processes is rigid, which typically only incorporates a decay in the variance, failing to adjust flexibly according to the agent's real-time learning status. Inspired by the analyzing and reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs), we design LLM-Explorer to adaptively generate task-specific exploration strategies with LLMs, enhancing the policy exploration in RL. In our design, we sample the learning trajectory of the agent during the RL training in a given task and prompt the LLM to analyze the agent's current policy learning status and then generate a probability distribution for future policy exploration. Updating the probability distribution periodically, we derive a stochastic process specialized for the particular task and dynamically adjusted to adapt to the learning process. Our design is a plug-in module compatible with various widely applied RL algorithms, including the DQN series, DDPG, TD3, and any possible variants developed based on them. Through extensive experiments on the Atari and MuJoCo benchmarks, we demonstrate LLM-Explorer's capability to enhance RL policy exploration, achieving an average performance improvement up to 37.27%.

Failing to control oversteer often leads to severe traffic accidents. Although recent autonomous driving efforts have attempted to handle oversteer through stabilizing maneuvers, the majority rely on expert-defined trajectories or assume obstacle-free environments, limiting real-world applicability. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving approach that tackles oversteer control and collision avoidance simultaneously. Existing E2E techniques, including Imitation Learning (IL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Hybrid Learning (HL), generally require near-optimal demonstrations or extensive experience. Yet even skilled human drivers struggle to provide perfect demonstrations under oversteer, and high transition variance hinders accumulating sufficient data. Hence, we present Q-Compared Soft Actor-Critic (QC-SAC), a new HL algorithm that effectively learns from suboptimal demonstration data and adapts rapidly to new conditions. To evaluate QC-SAC, we introduce a benchmark inspired by real-world driver training: a vehicle encounters sudden oversteer on a slippery surface and must avoid randomly placed obstacles ahead. Experimental results show QC-SAC attains near-optimal driving policies, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art IL, RL, and HL baselines. Our method demonstrates the world's first safe autonomous oversteer control with obstacle avoidance."}

Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization. RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code, which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive direction selection. Empirically, RD-Agent(Q) achieves up to 2X higher annualized returns than classical factor libraries using 70% fewer factors, and outperforms state-of-the-art deep time-series models on real markets. Its joint factor-model optimization delivers a strong balance between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness. Our code is available at: this https URL.'}

This limitation hinders real-world applications, particularly in complex tasks requiring dexterous manipulation. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm leverages large-scale data to enhance generalization. However, due to data scarcity, VLA's performance remains limited. In this work, we introduce Object-Focus Actor (OFA), a novel, data-efficient approach for generalized dexterous manipulation. OFA exploits the consistent end trajectories observed in dexterous manipulation tasks, allowing for efficient policy training. Our method employs a hierarchical pipeline: object perception and pose estimation, pre-manipulation pose arrival and OFA policy execution. This process ensures that the manipulation is focused and efficient, even in varied backgrounds and positional layout. Comprehensive real-world experiments across seven tasks demonstrate that OFA significantly outperforms baseline methods in both positional and background generalization tests. Notably, OFA achieves robust performance with only 10 demonstrations, highlighting its data efficiency."}
