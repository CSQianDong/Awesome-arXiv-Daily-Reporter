This framework--known as LLM-as-a-judge--is highly scalable and relatively low cost. However, it is also vulnerable to malicious exploitation, as LLM responses can be tuned to overfit the preferences of the judge. Previous work shows that the answers generated by a candidate-LLM can be edited post hoc to maximise the score assigned to them by a judge-LLM. In this study, we adopt a different approach and use the signal provided by judge-LLMs as a reward to adversarially tune models that generate text preambles designed to boost downstream performance. We find that frozen LLMs pipelined with these models attain higher LLM-evaluation scores than existing frameworks. Crucially, unlike other frameworks which intervene directly on the model's response, our method is virtually undetectable. We also demonstrate that the effectiveness of the tuned preamble generator transfers when the candidate-LLM and the judge-LLM are replaced with models that are not used during training. These findings raise important questions about the design of more reliable LLM-as-a-judge evaluation settings. They also demonstrate that human preferences can be reverse engineered effectively, by pipelining LLMs to optimise upstream preambles via reinforcement learning--an approach that could find future applications in diverse tasks and domains beyond adversarial attacks."}

This work is the first study to address a key research question: Can adversarial visual manipulations systematically fool LVLM judges into assigning unfairly inflated scores? We define potential image induced biases within the context of T2I evaluation and examine how these biases affect the evaluations of LVLM judges. Moreover, we introduce a novel, fine-grained, multi-domain meta-evaluation benchmark named FRAME, which is deliberately constructed to exhibit diverse score distributions. By introducing the defined biases into the benchmark, we reveal that all tested LVLM judges exhibit vulnerability across all domains, consistently inflating scores for manipulated images. Further analysis reveals that combining multiple biases amplifies their effects, and pairwise evaluations are similarly susceptible. Moreover, we observe that visual biases persist under prompt-based mitigation strategies, highlighting the vulnerability of current LVLM evaluation systems and underscoring the urgent need for more robust LVLM judges.'}

Evidence from top conference proceedings in AI', 'authors': 'Wenqing Wu, Haixu Xi, Chengzhi Zhang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15031', 'abstract': "Peer review is vital in academia for evaluating research quality. Top AI conferences use reviewer confidence scores to ensure review reliability, but existing studies lack fine-grained analysis of text-score consistency, potentially missing key details. This work assesses consistency at word, sentence, and aspect levels using deep learning and NLP conference review data. We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher confidence scores correlate with paper rejection, validating expert assessments and peer review fairness."}

To address this, we introduce WebNovelBench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating long-form novel generation. WebNovelBench leverages a large-scale dataset of over 4,000 Chinese web novels, framing evaluation as a synopsis-to-story generation task. We propose a multi-faceted framework encompassing eight narrative quality dimensions, assessed automatically via an LLM-as-Judge approach. Scores are aggregated using Principal Component Analysis and mapped to a percentile rank against human-authored works. Our experiments demonstrate that WebNovelBench effectively differentiates between human-written masterpieces, popular web novels, and LLM-generated content. We provide a comprehensive analysis of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs, ranking their storytelling abilities and offering insights for future development. This benchmark provides a scalable, replicable, and data-driven methodology for assessing and advancing LLM-driven narrative generation.'}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2505.15365', 'title': 'AI vs. Human Judgment of Content Moderation: LLM-as-a-Judge and Ethics-Based Response Refusals', 'authors': 'Stefan Pasch', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15365', 'abstract': 'As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings, their ability to refuse ethically sensitive prompts-such as those involving hate speech or illegal activities-has become central to content moderation and responsible AI practices. While refusal responses can be viewed as evidence of ethical alignment and safety-conscious behavior, recent research suggests that users may perceive them negatively. At the same time, automated assessments of model outputs are playing a growing role in both evaluation and training. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks-in which one model is used to evaluate the output of another-are now widely adopted to guide benchmarking and fine-tuning. This paper examines whether such model-based evaluators assess refusal responses differently than human users. Drawing on data from Chatbot Arena and judgments from two AI judges (GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B), we compare how different types of refusals are rated. We distinguish ethical refusals, which explicitly cite safety or normative concerns (e.g., "I can\'t help with that because it may be harmful"), and technical refusals, which reflect system limitations (e.g., "I can\'t answer because I lack real-time data"). We find that LLM-as-a-Judge systems evaluate ethical refusals significantly more favorably than human users, a divergence not observed for technical refusals. We refer to this divergence as a moderation bias-a systematic tendency for model-based evaluators to reward refusal behaviors more than human users do. This raises broader questions about transparency, value alignment, and the normative assumptions embedded in automated evaluation systems.'}

However, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the complexity of real-world problems, which demand open-ended, interdisciplinary reasoning and integration of computational tools. To address this gap, we introduce ModelingBench, a novel benchmark featuring real-world-inspired, open-ended problems from math modeling competitions across diverse domains, ranging from urban traffic optimization to ecosystem resource planning. These tasks require translating natural language into formal mathematical formulations, applying appropriate tools, and producing structured, defensible reports. ModelingBench also supports multiple valid solutions, capturing the ambiguity and creativity of practical modeling. We also present ModelingAgent, a multi-agent framework that coordinates tool use, supports structured workflows, and enables iterative self-refinement to generate well-grounded, creative solutions. To evaluate outputs, we further propose ModelingJudge, an expert-in-the-loop system leveraging LLMs as domain-specialized judges assessing solutions from multiple expert perspectives. Empirical results show that ModelingAgent substantially outperforms strong baselines and often produces solutions indistinguishable from those of human experts. Together, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and advancing real-world problem-solving in open-ended, interdisciplinary modeling challenges.'}

Gales', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15240', 'abstract': 'This paper explores generalised probabilistic modelling and uncertainty estimation in comparative LLM-as-a-judge frameworks. We show that existing Product-of-Experts methods are specific cases of a broader framework, enabling diverse modelling options. Furthermore, we propose improved uncertainty estimates for individual comparisons, enabling more efficient selection and achieving strong performance with fewer evaluations. We also introduce a method for estimating overall ranking uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate that combining absolute and comparative scoring improves performance. Experiments show that the specific expert model has a limited impact on final rankings but our proposed uncertainty estimates, especially the probability of reordering, significantly improve the efficiency of systems reducing the number of needed comparisons by ~50%. Furthermore, ranking-level uncertainty metrics can be used to identify low-performing predictions, where the nature of the probabilistic model has a notable impact on the quality of the overall uncertainty.'}
