This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.'}

In this work we extend the OpenLID classifier by adding more training data, merging problematic language variant clusters, and introducing a special label for marking noise. We call this extended system OpenLID-v3 and evaluate it against GlotLID on multiple benchmarks. During development, we focus on three groups of closely related languages (Bosnian, Croatian, and Serbian; Romance varieties of Northern Italy and Southern France; and Scandinavian languages) and contribute new evaluation datasets where existing ones are inadequate.

Extending this methodology to contextual embeddings in addition to static ones and applying it to a new corpus of Twitter posts, we show that the same findings hold for both domains, though the topic popularity growth factor may contribute less to neology on Twitter than in published writing. We hypothesize that this difference can be explained by the two domains favouring different neologism formation mechanisms.'}

Despite their practicality, LLM judges remain prone to miscalibration and systematic biases. This paper proposes SCOPE (Selective Conformal Optimized Pairwise Evaluation), a framework for selective pairwise judging with finite-sample statistical guarantees. Under exchangeability, SCOPE calibrates an acceptance threshold such that the error rate among non-abstained judgments is at most a user-specified level $\\alpha$. To provide SCOPE with a bias-neutral uncertainty signal, we introduce Bidirectional Preference Entropy (BPE), which queries the judge under both response positions, aggregates the implied preference probabilities to enforce invariance to response order, and converts the aggregated probability into an entropy-based uncertainty score. Across MT-Bench, RewardBench, and Chatbot Arena, BPE improves uncertainty quality over standard confidence proxies, providing a stronger selection signal that enables SCOPE to consistently meet the target risk level while retaining good coverage across judge scales. In particular, at $\\alpha = 0.10$, \\textsc{Scope} consistently satisfies the risk bound across all benchmarks and judge scales (empirical risk $\\approx 0.097$ to $0.099$), while retaining substantial coverage, reaching $0.89$ on RewardBench with Qwen-14B and $0.98$ on RewardBench with Qwen-32B.

Various linguistic properties of the training data were analyzed to identify relevant proficiency predictors associated with increasing complexity and correctness, rather than the writing task. Such lexical, morphological, surface, and error features were used to train classification models, which were compared to models that also allowed for other features. The pre-selected features yielded a similar test accuracy but reduced variation in the classification of different text types. The best classifiers achieved an accuracy of around 0.9. Additional evaluation on an earlier exam sample revealed that the writings have become more complex over a 7-10-year period, while accuracy still reached 0.8 with some feature sets. The results have been implemented in the writing evaluation module of an Estonian open-source language learning environment.'}

However, traditional expert-driven approaches rely heavily on manual analysis of large volumes of interview transcripts, making them costly and prone to randomness, ambiguity, and limited reproducibility. This study proposes a new competency modeling process built on large language models (LLMs). Instead of merely automating isolated steps, we reconstruct the workflow by decomposing expert practices into structured computational components. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract behavioral and psychological descriptions from raw textual data and map them to predefined competency libraries through embedding-based similarity. We further introduce a learnable parameter that adaptively integrates different information sources, enabling the model to determine the relative importance of behavioral and psychological signals. To address the long-standing challenge of validation, we develop an offline evaluation procedure that allows systematic model selection without requiring additional large-scale data collection. Empirical results from a real-world implementation in a software outsourcing company demonstrate strong predictive validity, cross-library consistency, and structural robustness. Overall, our framework transforms competency modeling from a largely qualitative and expert-dependent practice into a transparent, data-driven, and evaluable analytical process.'}

In the UK, one in four people belongs to an ethnic minority, and dementia prevalence is expected to rise most rapidly among Black and Asian communities. This study examines the trustworthiness of AI models, specifically the presence of bias, in detecting healthy multilingual English speakers among the cognitively impaired cohort, to make these tools clinically beneficial. For experiments, monolingual participants were recruited nationally (UK), and multilingual speakers were enrolled from four community centres in Sheffield and Bradford. In addition to a non-native English accent, multilinguals spoke Somali, Chinese, or South Asian languages, who were further divided into two Yorkshire accents (West and South) to challenge the efficiency of the AI tools thoroughly. Although ASR systems showed no significant bias across groups, classification and regression models using acoustic and linguistic features exhibited bias against multilingual speakers, particularly in memory, fluency, and reading tasks. This bias was more pronounced when models were trained on the publicly available DementiaBank dataset. Moreover, multilinguals were more likely to be misclassified as having cognitive decline. This study is the first of its kind to discover that, despite their strong overall performance, current AI models show bias against multilingual individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in the UK, and they are also more likely to misclassify speakers with a certain accent (South Yorkshire) as living with a more severe cognitive decline. In this pilot study, we conclude that the existing AI tools are therefore not yet reliable for diagnostic use in these populations, and we aim to address this in future work by developing more generalisable, bias-mitigated models.'}

Contrarily to keyphrase extraction approaches, keyphrase generation models can predict keyphrases that do not appear in a document's text called `absent keyphrases`. This ability means that keyphrase generation models can associate a document to a notion that is not explicitly mentioned in its text. Intuitively, this suggests that for two documents treating the same subjects, a keyphrase generation model is more likely to be homogeneous in their indexing i.e. predict the same keyphrase for both documents, regardless of those keyphrases appearing in their respective text or not; something a keyphrase extraction model would fail to do. Yet, homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models is not covered by current benchmarks. In this work, we introduce a method to evaluate the homogeneity of keyphrase prediction models and study if absent keyphrase generation capabilities actually help the model to be more homogeneous. To our surprise, we show that keyphrase extraction methods are competitive with generative models, and that the ability to generate absent keyphrases can actually have a negative impact on homogeneity.

Discovered failures are further consolidated into interpretable failure modes via failure-aware embeddings and boundary-aware induction.

In this work, we address Subtask B of the MultiPRIDE shared task at EVALITA 2026 by proposing a hierarchical approach to modeling the slur reclamation process. Our core assumption is that members of the LGBTQ+ community are more likely, on average, to employ certain slurs in a eclamatory manner. Based on this hypothesis, we decompose the task into two stages. First, using a weakly supervised LLM-based annotation, we assign fuzzy labels to users indicating the likelihood of belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, inferred from the tweet and the user bio. These soft labels are then used to train a BERT-like model to predict community membership, encouraging the model to learn latent representations associated with LGBTQ+ identity. In the second stage, we integrate this latent space with a newly initialized model for the downstream slur reclamation detection task. The intuition is that the first model encodes user-oriented sociolinguistic signals, which are then fused with representations learned by a model pretrained for hate speech detection. Experimental results on Italian and Spanish show that our approach achieves performance statistically comparable to a strong BERT-based baseline, while providing a modular and extensible framework for incorporating sociolinguistic context into hate speech modeling. We argue that more fine-grained hierarchical modeling of user identity and discourse context may further improve the detection of reclaimed language. We release our code at this https URL.'}

Moreover, it has been shown that, as the training of an LLM progresses, the performance in predicting brain activity from its internal activations improves more in the left hemisphere than in the right one. The aim of the present work is to understand which kind of competence acquired by the LLMs underlies the emergence of this left-right asymmetry. Using the OLMo-2 7B language model at various training checkpoints and fMRI data from English participants, we compare the evolution of the left-right asymmetry in brain scores alongside performance on several benchmarks. We observe that the asymmetry co-emerges with the formal linguistic abilities of the LLM. These abilities are demonstrated in two ways: by the model's capacity to assign a higher probability to an acceptable sentence than to a grammatically unacceptable one within a minimal contrasting pair, or its ability to produce well-formed text. On the opposite, the left-right asymmetry does not correlate with the performance on arithmetic or Dyck language tasks; nor with text-based tasks involving world knowledge and reasoning. We generalize these results to another family of LLMs (Pythia) and another language, namely French. Our observations indicate that the left-right asymmetry in brain predictivity matches the progress in formal linguistic competence (knowledge of linguistic patterns)."}

We introduce RAT-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for text anonymization tools based on re-identification risk. Using U.S. demographic statistics, we generate synthetic text containing various direct and indirect identifiers across domains, languages, and difficulty levels. We evaluate a range of NER- and LLM-based text anonymization tools and, based on the attributes an LLM-based attacker is able to correctly infer from the anonymized text, we report the risk of re-identification in the U.S. population, while properly accounting for the disparate impact of identifiers. We find that, while capabilities vary widely, even the best tools are far from perfect in particular when direct identifiers are not written in standard ways and when indirect identifiers enable re-identification.

A core design choice is how to fuse retrieved samples into the LLMs, where existing internal fusion approaches broadly fall into query-based fusion, parametric fusion, and latent-based fusion. Despite their effectiveness at modest retrieval scales, these methods often fail to scale gracefully as the number of retrieved candidates k increases: Larger k improves evidence coverage, yet realistic top-k retrieval inevitably contains irrelevant or redundant content and increases the inference cost.\nTo address these limitations, we propose ReFilter, a novel latent-based fusion framework that performs token-level filtering and fusion. ReFilter consists of three key components: a context encoder for encoding context features, a gated filter for weighting each token, and a token fusion module for integrating the weighted token feature into the LLM's hidden states. Our experiments across four general-domain QA benchmarks show that ReFilter consistently achieves the best average performance under both in-domain adaptation and out-of-domain transfer. ReFilter further generalizes to five biomedical QA benchmarks in zero-shot transfer without domain fine-tuning, reaching 70.01% average accuracy with Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct."}

Existing approaches follow either Generative (GRMs) or Discriminative (DRMs) paradigms, yet both suffer from limitations: GRMs typically demand costly point-wise supervision, while DRMs produce uncalibrated relative scores that lack probabilistic interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel reward modeling paradigm: Probabilistic Reward Model (PRM). Instead of modeling reward as a deterministic scalar, our approach treats it as a random variable, learning a full probability distribution for the quality of each response. To make this paradigm practical, we present its closed-form, discrete realization: the Ordinal Probabilistic Reward Model (OPRM), which discretizes the quality score into a finite set of ordinal ratings. Building on OPRM, we propose a data-efficient training strategy called Region Flooding Tuning (RgFT). It enables rewards to better reflect absolute text quality by incorporating quality-level annotations, which guide the model to concentrate the probability mass within corresponding rating sub-regions. Experiments on various reward model benchmarks show that our method improves accuracy by $\\textbf{2.9%}\\sim\\textbf{7.4%}$ compared to prior reward models, demonstrating strong performance and data efficiency.

Specifically, we first establish a theoretical relationship between the partition function and per-prompt accuracy estimates. Building on this key insight, we propose Partition Function-Guided RL (PACED-RL), a post-training framework that leverages accuracy estimates to prioritize informative question prompts during training, and further improves sample efficiency through an accuracy estimate error-prioritized replay. Crucially, both components reuse information already produced during GFlowNet training, effectively amortizing the compute overhead into the existing optimization process.

In order to improve stylistic quality, a crucial first step is to establish a reliable evaluation method. However, having legal experts manually develop such a metric is impractical, as the implicit stylistic requirements in legal writing practice are difficult to formalise into explicit rubrics. Meanwhile, existing automatic evaluation methods also fall short: reference-based metrics conflate semantic accuracy with stylistic fidelity, and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations suffer from opacity and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce CLASE (Chinese LegAlese Stylistic Evaluation), a hybrid evaluation method that focuses on the stylistic performance of legal text. The method incorporates a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines 1) linguistic feature-based scores and 2) experience-guided LLM-as-a-judge scores. Both the feature coefficients and the LLM scoring experiences are learned from contrastive pairs of authentic legal documents and their LLM-restored counterparts. This hybrid design captures both surface-level features and implicit stylistic norms in a transparent, reference-free manner. Experiments on 200 Chinese legal documents show that CLASE achieves substantially higher alignment with human judgments than traditional metrics and pure LLM-as-a-judge methods. Beyond improved alignment, CLASE provides interpretable score breakdowns and suggestions for improvements, offering a scalable and practical solution for professional stylistic evaluation in legal text generation (Code and data for CLASE is available at: this https URL).'}

Although rigorous, these approaches require large samples and may be constrained by data availability and cross-cultural comparability. Recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the semantic structure of questionnaire items may encode latent construct organization, offering a complementary response-free perspective. We introduce a topic-modeling framework that operationalizes semantic latent structure for scale simplification. Items are encoded using contextual sentence embeddings and grouped via density-based clustering to discover latent semantic factors without predefining their number. Class-based term weighting derives interpretable topic representations that approximate constructs and enable merging of semantically adjacent clusters. Representative items are selected using membership criteria within an integrated reduction pipeline. We benchmarked the framework across DASS, IPIP, and EPOCH, evaluating structural recovery, internal consistency, factor congruence, correlation preservation, and reduction efficiency. The proposed method recovered coherent factor-like groupings aligned with established constructs. Selected items reduced scale length by 60.5% on average while maintaining psychometric adequacy. Simplified scales showed high concordance with original factor structures and preserved inter-factor correlations, indicating that semantic latent organization provides a response-free approximation of measurement structure. Our framework formalizes semantic structure as an inspectable front-end for scale construction and reduction.

We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization.

However, existing industrial systems face two fundamental challenges: (1) the semantic gap between discrete user features and the semantic intents within the chatbot\'s Knowledge Base, and (2) the objective misalignment between general-purpose LLM outputs and task-specific ranking utilities. To address these issues, we propose RGAlign-Rec, a closed-loop alignment framework that integrates an LLM-based semantic reasoner with a Query-Enhanced (QE) ranking model. We also introduce Ranking-Guided Alignment (RGA), a multi-stage training paradigm that utilizes downstream ranking signals as feedback to refine the LLM\'s latent reasoning. Extensive experiments on a large-scale industrial dataset from Shopee demonstrate that RGAlign-Rec achieves a 0.12% gain in GAUC, leading to a significant 3.52% relative reduction in error rate, and a 0.56% improvement in Recall@3. Online A/B testing further validates the cumulative effectiveness of our framework: the Query-Enhanced model (QE-Rec) initially yields a 0.98% improvement in CTR, while the subsequent Ranking-Guided Alignment stage contributes an additional 0.13% gain. These results indicate that ranking-aware alignment effectively synchronizes semantic reasoning with ranking objectives, significantly enhancing both prediction accuracy and service quality in real-world proactive recommendation systems.'}

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently.

By constructing a similarity graph over lyric texts and applying community detection, we uncover stable micro-theme communities without genre, artist, or language supervision. We further identify boundary-spanning songs via graph-theoretic bridge metrics and analyse their structural properties. Across multiple robustness settings, boundary-spanning lyrics exhibit higher lexical diversity and lower repetition compared to core community members, challenging the assumption that hook intensity or repetition drives cross-theme connectivity. Our framework is language-agnostic and applicable to unlabeled cultural text corpora.'}

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VimRAG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse multimodal RAG benchmarks. The code is available at this https URL.'}

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy. Crucially, under high compression ratios, our method remains robust while heuristic-based techniques degrade sharply."}

We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics. We provide theoretical characterizations of the expressivity and implications of this structure, and empirically show that HyperMLP/HyperGLU consistently outperform strong softmax-attention baselines under matched parameter budgets.'}

While this paradigm better exploits the reasoning and contextual understanding capabilities of LLMs, most existing LLM-based rerankers rely on autoregressive generation, which limits their efficiency and flexibility. In particular, token-by-token decoding incurs high latency, while the fixed left-to-right generation order causes early prediction errors to propagate and is difficult to revise. To address these limitations, we explore the use of diffusion language models (dLLMs) for document reranking and propose DiffuRank, a reranking framework built upon dLLMs. Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs support more flexible decoding and generation processes that are not constrained to a left-to-right order, and enable parallel decoding, which may lead to improved efficiency and controllability. Specifically, we investigate three reranking strategies based on dLLMs: (1) a pointwise approach that uses dLLMs to estimate the relevance of each query-document pair; (2) a logit-based listwise approach that prompts dLLMs to jointly assess the relevance of multiple documents and derives ranking lists directly from model logits; and (3) a permutation-based listwise approach that adapts the canonical decoding process of dLLMs to the reranking tasks. For each approach, we design corresponding training methods to fully exploit the advantages of dLLMs. We evaluate both zero-shot and fine-tuned reranking performance on multiple benchmarks. Experimental results show that dLLMs achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of autoregressive LLMs with similar model sizes. These findings demonstrate the promise of diffusion-based language models as a compelling alternative to autoregressive architectures for document reranking.'}

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.'}

Across four aligned instruction-tuned models and twelve jailbreak attacks, CC-Delta achieves comparable or better safety-utility tradeoffs than baseline defenses operating in dense latent space. In particular, our method clearly outperforms dense mean-shift steering on all four models, and particularly against out-of-distribution attacks, showing that steering in sparse SAE feature space offers advantages over steering in dense activation space for jailbreak mitigation.

To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

In this work, we propose two new methods for DNA-language fusion, i.e., a semantic alignment method SeqCLIP and a vocabulary-level integration method OneVocab. SeqCLIP strengthens embedding-level alignment via sequence-level contrastive pre-training, and OneVocab directly integrates genomic $k$-mers into the language model's existing vocabulary. Comprehensive experiments on classification and reasoning tasks show that, while various alignment strategies improve embedding-level fusion, early vocabulary-level integration yields more expressive and effective representations for DNA-language modeling."}
