However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we introduce $\\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\\texttt{DRAG}$ effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs."}

As web agents become increasingly capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks. WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro, there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena, highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.'}

To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs, outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.'}

In this work, we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e., forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20 rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71 on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models, highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the 80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to further improve LLM reasoning."}

Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context. However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach. Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices, pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability.

For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect.

However, recent RPAs are often built on explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes, resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role) and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing attention diversion and style drift.'}

Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks."}

In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available.

Existing reflection methods are simplistic and struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection.

A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple subword-level language games, including character counting, substring identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch. These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code open-sourced at: this https URL."}

To address these limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework, containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained, interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData, and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.'}

However, they struggle with the unique challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module, and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent difficulty of the task.

In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs."}

To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values. Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing Chinese characteristics.

To address this issue, we propose a novel cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training procedure.

In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification, clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant. Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.'}

While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4), raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs, enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement. Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as efficient anonymizers.

Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to $256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher $k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors.

Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health."}

Current episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration, limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters).

We propose a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.

Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches, allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily applied to even large-scale models.

However, its hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language. By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping, prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on 'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora.

The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity, requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%)."}

This paper introduces Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting, RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset, Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness, highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness, ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI."}

We introduce zip2zip, a framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable "hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences.

To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains.

In this paper, we highlight that not every token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens.

In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources.

Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.'}

Robust causal reasoning is fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are rarely explicitly conveyed.

Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates.

Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable models, particularly in the context of logical negation.

KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ.

On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction.

We show that they cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons. Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages.

Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups, XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of 3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.'}

We first train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation (e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms, where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.'}

The goal is to enhance task adaptability and training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks, the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy, gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular, the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively leverage the representational power of large language models.

Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.'}

Ashley', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00694', 'abstract': "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers.

ARIA aims to project natural language actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks, consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.'}

Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged.

This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning this http URL this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation.

In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods.

Recent studies have introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models' generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1) general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage, we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs."}

So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations.

We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model.

However, one challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models (LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information, within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning."}

Iterative and adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex, knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.'}

In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews.

Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\\% and 33\\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting.

However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging.

When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.'}

Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual reasoning across regions.

This data is collected to support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs, especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have a disability.'}

We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.'}

However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.'}

Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives.

By proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.'}

The agent then takes an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, despite using only self-generated training data.'}

Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones.

One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners.

Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles.

While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer -- a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks, especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms. We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling. Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for solving different classes of tasks.'}

The likelihood of password leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.

A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

While these led to specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\\% over baseline settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate steps remains a critical challenge even after RL."}

In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.'}

However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG.

First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.'}

These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \\textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.'}

To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes.

However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability, improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment.

Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which demonstrates its flexibility.'}

In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.'}

We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment."}

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions.

While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from this http URL, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy.'}

(2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.'}

These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions.

However, little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety. Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training, revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that, across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.'}

Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the only exceptions.

To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary.
