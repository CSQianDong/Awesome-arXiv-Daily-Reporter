# Thinking agents for zero-shot generalization to qualitatively novel tasks 

**Authors**: Thomas Miconi, Kevin McKee, Yicong Zheng, Jed McCaleb  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19815)  

**Abstract**: Intelligent organisms can solve truly novel problems which they have never encountered before, either in their lifetime or their evolution. An important component of this capacity is the ability to ``think'', that is, to mentally manipulate objects, concepts and behaviors in order to plan and evaluate possible solutions to novel problems, even without environment interaction. To generate problems that are truly qualitatively novel, while still solvable zero-shot (by mental simulation), we use the combinatorial nature of environments: we train the agent while withholding a specific combination of the environment's elements. The novel test task, based on this combination, is thus guaranteed to be truly novel, while still mentally simulable since the agent has been exposed to each individual element (and their pairwise interactions) during training. We propose a method to train agents endowed with world models to make use their mental simulation abilities, by selecting tasks based on the difference between the agent's pre-thinking and post-thinking performance. When tested on the novel, withheld problem, the resulting agent successfully simulated alternative scenarios and used the resulting information to guide its behavior in the actual environment, solving the novel task in a single real-environment trial (zero-shot).

# Guidelines For The Choice Of The Baseline in XAI Attribution Methods 

**Authors**: Cristian Morasso, Giorgio Dolci, Ilaria Boscolo Galazzo, Sergey M. Plis, Gloria Menegaz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19813)  

**Abstract**: Given the broad adoption of artificial intelligence, it is essential to provide evidence that AI models are reliable, trustable, and fair. To this end, the emerging field of eXplainable AI develops techniques to probe such requirements, counterbalancing the hype pushing the pervasiveness of this technology. Among the many facets of this issue, this paper focuses on baseline attribution methods, aiming at deriving a feature attribution map at the network input relying on a "neutral" stimulus usually called "baseline". The choice of the baseline is crucial as it determines the explanation of the network behavior. In this framework, this paper has the twofold goal of shedding light on the implications of the choice of the baseline and providing a simple yet effective method for identifying the best baseline for the task. To achieve this, we propose a decision boundary sampling method, since the baseline, by definition, lies on the decision boundary, which naturally becomes the search domain. Experiments are performed on synthetic examples and validated relying on state-of-the-art methods. Despite being limited to the experimental scope, this contribution is relevant as it offers clear guidelines and a simple proxy for baseline selection, reducing ambiguity and enhancing deep models' reliability and trust.

# Simulating Tracking Data to Advance Sports Analytics Research 

**Authors**: David Radke, Kyle Tilbury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19809)  

**Abstract**: Advanced analytics have transformed how sports teams operate, particularly in episodic sports like baseball. Their impact on continuous invasion sports, such as soccer and ice hockey, has been limited due to increased game complexity and restricted access to high-resolution game tracking data. In this demo, we present a method to collect and utilize simulated soccer tracking data from the Google Research Football environment to support the development of models designed for continuous tracking data. The data is stored in a schema that is representative of real tracking data and we provide processes that extract high-level features and events. We include examples of established tracking data models to showcase the efficacy of the simulated data. We address the scarcity of publicly available tracking data, providing support for research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and sports analytics.

# Splitting Answer Set Programs with respect to Intensionality Statements (Extended Version) 

**Authors**: Jorge Fandinno, Yuliya Lierler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19762)  

**Abstract**: Splitting a logic program allows us to reduce the task of computing its stable models to similar tasks for its subprograms. This can be used to increase solving performance and prove program correctness. We generalize the conditions under which this technique is applicable, by considering not only dependencies between predicates but also their arguments and context. This allows splitting programs commonly used in practice to which previous results were not applicable.

**Authors**: Lewis Newsham, Ryan Hyland, Daniel Prince  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19752)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents SANDMAN, an architecture for cyber deception that leverages Language Agents to emulate convincing human simulacra. Our 'Deceptive Agents' serve as advanced cyber decoys, designed for high-fidelity engagement with attackers by extending the observation period of attack behaviours. Through experimentation, measurement, and analysis, we demonstrate how a prompt schema based on the five-factor model of personality systematically induces distinct 'personalities' in Large Language Models. Our results highlight the feasibility of persona-driven Language Agents for generating diverse, realistic behaviours, ultimately improving cyber deception strategies.

# Optimal Path Planning and Cost Minimization for a Drone Delivery System Via Model Predictive Control 

**Authors**: Muhammad Al-Zafar Khan, Jamal Al-Karaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19699)  

**Abstract**: In this study, we formulate the drone delivery problem as a control problem and solve it using Model Predictive Control. Two experiments are performed: The first is on a less challenging grid world environment with lower dimensionality, and the second is with a higher dimensionality and added complexity. The MPC method was benchmarked against three popular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL): Independent $Q$-Learning (IQL), Joint Action Learners (JAL), and Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN). It was shown that the MPC method solved the problem quicker and required fewer optimal numbers of drones to achieve a minimized cost and navigate the optimal path.

# Innate Reasoning is Not Enough: In-Context Learning Enhances Reasoning Large Language Models with Less Overthinking 

**Authors**: Yuyao Ge, Shenghua Liu, Yiwei Wang, Lingrui Mei, Lizhe Chen, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19602)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs), which employ extended thinking processes with reflection and self-correction capabilities, demonstrating the effectiveness of test-time scaling. RLLMs exhibit innate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capability obtained from training, leading to a natural question: "Is CoT prompting, a popular In-Context Learning (ICL) method for chat LLMs, necessary to enhance the reasoning capability of RLLMs?" In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT on RLLMs across mathematical reasoning tasks. We examine models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, finding that contrary to concerns, CoT prompting significantly enhances RLLMs' performance in most scenarios. Our results reveal distinct patterns: large-capacity models show minimal improvement on simple tasks but substantial gains on complex problems, while smaller models exhibit the opposite behavior. Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting effectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and reasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some cases. Moreover, attention logits analysis reveals the RLLMs' overfitting to reflection-related words, which is mitigated by external CoT guidance. Notably, our experiments indicate that for RLLMs, one-shot CoT consistently yields superior performance compared to Few-shot CoT approaches. Our findings provide important insights for optimizing RLLMs' performance through appropriate prompting strategies.

**Authors**: Songtao Sun, Jingyi Li, Yuanfei Dong, Haoguang Liu, Chenxin Xu, Fuyang Li, Qiang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19584)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a multi-agent application system designed to enhance office collaboration efficiency and work quality. The system integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing technologies, achieving functionalities such as task allocation, progress monitoring, and information sharing. The agents within the system are capable of providing personalized collaboration support based on team members' needs and incorporate data analysis tools to improve decision-making quality. The paper also proposes an intelligent agent architecture that separates Plan and Solver, and through techniques such as multi-turn query rewriting and business tool retrieval, it enhances the agent's multi-intent and multi-turn dialogue capabilities. Furthermore, the paper details the design of tools and multi-turn dialogue in the context of office collaboration scenarios, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments and evaluations. Ultimately, the system has demonstrated outstanding performance in real business applications, particularly in query understanding, task planning, and tool calling. Looking forward, the system is expected to play a more significant role in addressing complex interaction issues within dynamic environments and large-scale multi-agent systems.

# ReSearch: Learning to Reason with Search for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Mingyang Chen, Tianpeng Li, Haoze Sun, Yijie Zhou, Chenzheng Zhu, Fan Yang, Zenan Zhou, Weipeng Chen, Haofen Wang, Jeff Z. Pan, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19470)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in reasoning, exemplified by the success of OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1. However, integrating reasoning with external search processes remains challenging, especially for complex multi-hop questions requiring multiple retrieval steps. We propose ReSearch, a novel framework that trains LLMs to Reason with Search via reinforcement learning without using any supervised data on reasoning steps. Our approach treats search operations as integral components of the reasoning chain, where when and how to perform searches is guided by text-based thinking, and search results subsequently influence further reasoning. We train ReSearch on Qwen2.5-7B(-Instruct) and Qwen2.5-32B(-Instruct) models and conduct extensive experiments. Despite being trained on only one dataset, our models demonstrate strong generalizability across various benchmarks. Analysis reveals that ReSearch naturally elicits advanced reasoning capabilities such as reflection and self-correction during the reinforcement learning process.

# Process or Result? Manipulated Ending Tokens Can Mislead Reasoning LLMs to Ignore the Correct Reasoning Steps 

**Authors**: Yu Cui, Bryan Hooi, Yujun Cai, Yiwei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19326)  

**Abstract**: Recent reasoning large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in mathematical reasoning capabilities through long Chain-of-Thought. The reasoning tokens of these models enable self-correction within reasoning chains, enhancing robustness. This motivates our exploration: how vulnerable are reasoning LLMs to subtle errors in their input reasoning chains? We introduce "Compromising Thought" (CPT), a vulnerability where models presented with reasoning tokens containing manipulated calculation results tend to ignore correct reasoning steps and adopt incorrect results instead. Through systematic evaluation across multiple reasoning LLMs, we design three increasingly explicit prompting methods to measure CPT resistance, revealing that models struggle significantly to identify and correct these manipulations. Notably, contrary to existing research suggesting structural alterations affect model performance more than content modifications, we find that local ending token manipulations have greater impact on reasoning outcomes than structural changes. Moreover, we discover a security vulnerability in DeepSeek-R1 where tampered reasoning tokens can trigger complete reasoning cessation. Our work enhances understanding of reasoning robustness and highlights security considerations for reasoning-intensive applications.

# Observation Adaptation via Annealed Importance Resampling for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes 

**Authors**: Yunuo Zhang, Baiting Luo, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19302)  

**Abstract**: Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a general mathematical model for sequential decision-making in stochastic environments under state uncertainty. POMDPs are often solved \textit{online}, which enables the algorithm to adapt to new information in real time. Online solvers typically use bootstrap particle filters based on importance resampling for updating the belief distribution. Since directly sampling from the ideal state distribution given the latest observation and previous state is infeasible, particle filters approximate the posterior belief distribution by propagating states and adjusting weights through prediction and resampling steps. However, in practice, the importance resampling technique often leads to particle degeneracy and sample impoverishment when the state transition model poorly aligns with the posterior belief distribution, especially when the received observation is highly informative. We propose an approach that constructs a sequence of bridge distributions between the state-transition and optimal distributions through iterative Monte Carlo steps, better accommodating noisy observations in online POMDP solvers. Our algorithm demonstrates significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated across multiple challenging POMDP domains.

**Authors**: Sky CH-Wang, Darshan Deshpande, Smaranda Muresan, Anand Kannappan, Rebecca Qian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19193)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Browsing Lost Unformed Recollections, a tip-of-the-tongue known-item search and reasoning benchmark for general AI assistants. BLUR introduces a set of 573 real-world validated questions that demand searching and reasoning across multi-modal and multilingual inputs, as well as proficient tool use, in order to excel on. Humans easily ace these questions (scoring on average 98%), while the best-performing system scores around 56%. To facilitate progress toward addressing this challenging and aspirational use case for general AI assistants, we release 350 questions through a public leaderboard, retain the answers to 250 of them, and have the rest as a private test set.

# AssertionForge: Enhancing Formal Verification Assertion Generation with Structured Representation of Specifications and RTL 

**Authors**: Yunsheng Bai, Ghaith Bany Hamad, Syed Suhaib, Haoxing Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19174)  

**Abstract**: Generating SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) from natural language specifications remains a major challenge in formal verification (FV) due to the inherent ambiguity and incompleteness of specifications. Existing LLM-based approaches, such as AssertLLM, focus on extracting information solely from specification documents, often failing to capture essential internal signal interactions and design details present in the RTL code, leading to incomplete or incorrect assertions. We propose a novel approach that constructs a Knowledge Graph (KG) from both specifications and RTL, using a hardware-specific schema with domain-specific entity and relation types. We create an initial KG from the specification and then systematically fuse it with information extracted from the RTL code, resulting in a unified, comprehensive KG. This combined representation enables a more thorough understanding of the design and allows for a multi-resolution context synthesis process which is designed to extract diverse verification contexts from the KG. Experiments on four designs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances SVA quality over prior methods. This structured representation not only improves FV but also paves the way for future research in tasks like code generation and design understanding.

# Information-Seeking Decision Strategies Mitigate Risk in Dynamic, Uncertain Environments 

**Authors**: Nicholas W. Barendregt, Joshua I. Gold, Krešimir Josić, Zachary P. Kilpatrick  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19107)  

**Abstract**: To survive in dynamic and uncertain environments, individuals must develop effective decision strategies that balance information gathering and decision commitment. Models of such strategies often prioritize either optimizing tangible payoffs, like reward rate, or gathering information to support a diversity of (possibly unknown) objectives. However, our understanding of the relative merits of these two approaches remains incomplete, in part because direct comparisons have been limited to idealized, static environments that lack the dynamic complexity of the real world. Here we compared the performance of normative reward- and information-seeking strategies in a dynamic foraging task. Both strategies show similar transitions between exploratory and exploitative behaviors as environmental uncertainty changes. However, we find subtle disparities in the actions they take, resulting in meaningful performance differences: whereas reward-seeking strategies generate slightly more reward on average, information-seeking strategies provide more consistent and predictable outcomes. Our findings support the adaptive value of information-seeking behaviors that can mitigate risk with minimal reward loss.

# The Misinterpretable Evidence Conveyed by Arbitrary Codes 

**Authors**: Guido Fioretti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18984)  

**Abstract**: Evidence Theory is a mathematical framework for handling imprecise reasoning in the context of a judge evaluating testimonies or a detective evaluating cues, rather than a gambler playing games of chance. In comparison to Probability Theory, it is better equipped to deal with ambiguous information and novel possibilities. Furthermore, arrival and evaluation of testimonies implies a communication channel.
This paper explores the possibility of employing Evidence Theory to represent arbitrary communication codes between and within living organisms. In this paper, different schemes are explored for living organisms incapable of anticipation, animals sufficiently sophisticated to be capable of extrapolation, and humans capable of reading one other's minds.

**Authors**: Marcus Tantakoun, Xiaodan Zhu, Christian Muise  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18971)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks but often struggle with long-horizon planning problems requiring structured reasoning. This limitation has drawn interest in integrating neuro-symbolic approaches within the Automated Planning (AP) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) communities. However, identifying optimal AP deployment frameworks can be daunting. This paper aims to provide a timely survey of the current research with an in-depth analysis, positioning LLMs as tools for extracting and refining planning models to support reliable AP planners. By systematically reviewing the current state of research, we highlight methodologies, and identify critical challenges and future directions, hoping to contribute to the joint research on NLP and Automated Planning.

# MedAgent-Pro: Towards Multi-modal Evidence-based Medical Diagnosis via Reasoning Agentic Workflow 

**Authors**: Ziyue Wang, Junde Wu, Chang Han Low, Yueming Jin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18968)  

**Abstract**: Developing reliable AI systems to assist human clinicians in multi-modal medical diagnosis has long been a key objective for researchers. Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention and achieved success across various domains. With strong reasoning capabilities and the ability to perform diverse tasks based on user instructions, they hold great potential for enhancing medical diagnosis. However, directly applying MLLMs to the medical domain still presents challenges. They lack detailed perception of visual inputs, limiting their ability to perform quantitative image analysis, which is crucial for medical diagnostics. Additionally, MLLMs often exhibit hallucinations and inconsistencies in reasoning, whereas clinical diagnoses must adhere strictly to established criteria. To address these challenges, we propose MedAgent-Pro, an evidence-based reasoning agentic system designed to achieve reliable, explainable, and precise medical diagnoses. This is accomplished through a hierarchical workflow: at the task level, knowledge-based reasoning generate reliable diagnostic plans for specific diseases following retrieved clinical criteria. While at the case level, multiple tool agents process multi-modal inputs, analyze different indicators according to the plan, and provide a final diagnosis based on both quantitative and qualitative evidence. Comprehensive experiments on both 2D and 3D medical diagnosis tasks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of MedAgent-Pro, while case studies further highlight its reliability and interpretability.

# Advancing Deep Learning through Probability Engineering: A Pragmatic Paradigm for Modern AI 

**Authors**: Jianyi Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18958)  

**Abstract**: Recent years have witnessed the rapid progression of deep learning, pushing us closer to the realization of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Probabilistic modeling is critical to many of these advancements, which provides a foundational framework for capturing data distributions. However, as the scale and complexity of AI applications grow, traditional probabilistic modeling faces escalating challenges, such as high-dimensional parameter spaces, heterogeneous data sources, and evolving real-world requirements often render classical approaches insufficiently flexible.
This paper proposes a novel concept, Probability Engineering, which treats the already-learned probability distributions within deep learning as engineering artifacts. Rather than merely fitting or inferring distributions, we actively modify and reinforce them to better address the diverse and evolving demands of modern AI. Specifically, Probability Engineering introduces novel techniques and constraints to refine existing probability distributions, improving their robustness, efficiency, adaptability, or trustworthiness.
We showcase this paradigm through a series of applications spanning Bayesian deep learning, Edge AI (including federated learning and knowledge distillation), and Generative AI (such as text-to-image generation with diffusion models and high-quality text generation with large language models). These case studies demonstrate how probability distributions once treated as static objects can be engineered to meet the diverse and evolving requirements of large-scale, data-intensive, and trustworthy AI systems. By systematically expanding and strengthening the role of probabilistic modeling, Probability Engineering paves the way for more robust, adaptive, efficient, and trustworthy deep learning solutions in today's fast-growing AI era.

# Is there a future for AI without representation? 

**Authors**: Vincent C. Müller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18955)  

**Abstract**: This paper investigates the prospects of AI without representation in general, and the proposals of Rodney Brooks in particular. What turns out to be characteristic of Brooks' proposal is the rejection of central control in intelligent agents; his systems has as much or as little representation as traditional AI. The traditional view that representation is necessary for intelligence presupposes that intelligence requires central control. However, much of recent cognitive science suggests that we should dispose of the image of intelligent agents as central representation processors. If this paradigm shift is achieved, Brooks' proposal for non-centralized cognition without representation appears promising for full-blown intelligent agents - though not for conscious agents and thus not for human-like AI.

# CAFe: Unifying Representation and Generation with Contrastive-Autoregressive Finetuning 

**Authors**: Hao Yu, Zhuokai Zhao, Shen Yan, Lukasz Korycki, Jianyu Wang, Baosheng He, Jiayi Liu, Lizhu Zhang, Xiangjun Fan, Hanchao Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19900)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven significant progress in multimodal tasks, enabling models to interpret, reason, and generate outputs across both visual and textual domains. While excelling in generative tasks, existing LVLMs often face limitations in tasks requiring high-fidelity representation learning, such as generating image or text embeddings for retrieval. Recent work has proposed finetuning LVLMs for representational learning, but the fine-tuned model often loses its generative capabilities due to the representational learning training paradigm. To address this trade-off, we introduce CAFe, a contrastive-autoregressive fine-tuning framework that enhances LVLMs for both representation and generative tasks. By integrating a contrastive objective with autoregressive language modeling, our approach unifies these traditionally separate tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both multimodal retrieval and multimodal generative benchmarks, including object hallucination (OH) mitigation. CAFe establishes a novel framework that synergizes embedding and generative functionalities in a single model, setting a foundation for future multimodal models that excel in both retrieval precision and coherent output generation.

# A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to national security posed by AI systems 

**Authors**: Alejandro Ortega  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19887)  

**Abstract**: Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national security threats posed by AI systems.

# Dynamics of Structured Complex-Valued Hopfield Neural Networks 

**Authors**: Rama Murthy Garimella, Marcos Eduardo Valle, Guilherme Vieira, Anil Rayala, Dileep Munugoti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19885)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore the dynamics of structured complex-valued Hopfield neural networks (CvHNNs), which arise when the synaptic weight matrix possesses specific structural properties. We begin by analyzing CvHNNs with a Hermitian synaptic weight matrix and establish the existence of four-cycle dynamics in CvHNNs with skew-Hermitian weight matrices operating synchronously. Furthermore, we introduce two new classes of complex-valued matrices: braided Hermitian and braided skew-Hermitian matrices. We demonstrate that CvHNNs utilizing these matrix types exhibit cycles of length eight when operating in full parallel update mode. Finally, we conduct extensive computational experiments on synchronous CvHNNs, exploring other synaptic weight matrix structures. The findings provide a comprehensive overview of the dynamics of structured CvHNNs, offering insights that may contribute to developing improved associative memory models when integrated with suitable learning rules.

# GENIUS: A Generative Framework for Universal Multimodal Search 

**Authors**: Sungyeon Kim, Xinliang Zhu, Xiaofan Lin, Muhammet Bastan, Douglas Gray, Suha Kwak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19868)  

**Abstract**: Generative retrieval is an emerging approach in information retrieval that generates identifiers (IDs) of target data based on a query, providing an efficient alternative to traditional embedding-based retrieval methods. However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.

# Geometric Meta-Learning via Coupled Ricci Flow: Unifying Knowledge Representation and Quantum Entanglement 

**Authors**: Ming Lei, Christophe Baehr  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19867)  

**Abstract**: This paper establishes a unified framework integrating geometric flows with deep learning through three fundamental innovations. First, we propose a thermodynamically coupled Ricci flow that dynamically adapts parameter space geometry to loss landscape topology, formally proved to preserve isometric knowledge embedding (Theorem~\ref{thm:isometric}). Second, we derive explicit phase transition thresholds and critical learning rates (Theorem~\ref{thm:critical}) through curvature blowup analysis, enabling automated singularity resolution via geometric surgery (Lemma~\ref{lem:surgery}). Third, we establish an AdS/CFT-type holographic duality (Theorem~\ref{thm:ads}) between neural networks and conformal field theories, providing entanglement entropy bounds for regularization design. Experiments demonstrate 2.1$\times$ convergence acceleration and 63\% topological simplification while maintaining $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ complexity, outperforming Riemannian baselines by 15.2\% in few-shot accuracy. Theoretically, we prove exponential stability (Theorem~\ref{thm:converge}) through a new Lyapunov function combining Perelman entropy with Wasserstein gradient flows, fundamentally advancing geometric deep learning.

# Guarding against artificial intelligence--hallucinated citations: the case for full-text reference deposit 

**Authors**: Alex Glynn  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19848)  

**Abstract**: The tendency of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems to "hallucinate" false information is well-known; AI-generated citations to non-existent sources have made their way into the reference lists of peer-reviewed publications. Here, I propose a solution to this problem, taking inspiration from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) data sharing guidelines, the clash of generative AI with the American judiciary, and the precedent set by submissions of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Journals should require authors to submit the full text of each cited source along with their manuscripts, thereby preventing authors from citing any material whose full text they cannot produce. This solution requires limited additional work on the part of authors or editors while effectively immunizing journals against hallucinated references.

# A Comparative Analysis of Word Segmentation, Part-of-Speech Tagging, and Named Entity Recognition for Historical Chinese Sources, 1900-1950 

**Authors**: Zhao Fang, Liang-Chun Wu, Xuening Kong, Spencer Dean Stewart  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19844)  

**Abstract**: This paper compares large language models (LLMs) and traditional natural language processing (NLP) tools for performing word segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) on Chinese texts from 1900 to 1950. Historical Chinese documents pose challenges for text analysis due to their logographic script, the absence of natural word boundaries, and significant linguistic changes. Using a sample dataset from the Shanghai Library Republican Journal corpus, traditional tools such as Jieba and spaCy are compared to LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and the GLM series. The results show that LLMs outperform traditional methods in all metrics, albeit at considerably higher computational costs, highlighting a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, LLMs better handle genre-specific challenges such as poetry and temporal variations (i.e., pre-1920 versus post-1920 texts), demonstrating that their contextual learning capabilities can advance NLP approaches to historical texts by reducing the need for domain-specific training data.

# GyralNet Subnetwork Partitioning via Differentiable Spectral Modularity Optimization 

**Authors**: Yan Zhuang, Minheng Chen, Chao Cao, Tong Chen, Jing Zhang, Xiaowei Yu, Yanjun Lyu, Lu Zhang, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19823)  

**Abstract**: Understanding the structural and functional organization of the human brain requires a detailed examination of cortical folding patterns, among which the three-hinge gyrus (3HG) has been identified as a key structural landmark. GyralNet, a network representation of cortical folding, models 3HGs as nodes and gyral crests as edges, highlighting their role as critical hubs in cortico-cortical connectivity. However, existing methods for analyzing 3HGs face significant challenges, including the sub-voxel scale of 3HGs at typical neuroimaging resolutions, the computational complexity of establishing cross-subject correspondences, and the oversimplification of treating 3HGs as independent nodes without considering their community-level relationships. To address these limitations, we propose a fully differentiable subnetwork partitioning framework that employs a spectral modularity maximization optimization strategy to modularize the organization of 3HGs within GyralNet. By incorporating topological structural similarity and DTI-derived connectivity patterns as attribute features, our approach provides a biologically meaningful representation of cortical organization. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that our method effectively partitions GyralNet at the individual level while preserving the community-level consistency of 3HGs across subjects, offering a robust foundation for understanding brain connectivity.

# Bitstream Collisions in Neural Image Compression via Adversarial Perturbations 

**Authors**: Jordan Madden, Lhamo Dorje, Xiaohua Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19817)  

**Abstract**: Neural image compression (NIC) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical compression techniques, offering improved compression ratios. Despite its progress towards standardization and practical deployment, there has been minimal exploration into it's robustness and security. This study reveals an unexpected vulnerability in NIC - bitstream collisions - where semantically different images produce identical compressed bitstreams. Utilizing a novel whitebox adversarial attack algorithm, this paper demonstrates that adding carefully crafted perturbations to semantically different images can cause their compressed bitstreams to collide exactly. The collision vulnerability poses a threat to the practical usability of NIC, particularly in security-critical applications. The cause of the collision is analyzed, and a simple yet effective mitigation method is presented.

**Abstract**: Low-light image enhancement is crucial for a myriad of applications, from night vision and surveillance, to autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent limitations that come in hand with capturing images in low-illumination environments, the task of enhancing such scenes still presents a formidable challenge. To advance research in this field, we introduce our Low Exposure Night Vision (LENVIZ) Dataset, a comprehensive multi-exposure benchmark dataset for low-light image enhancement comprising of over 230K frames showcasing 24K real-world indoor and outdoor, with-and without human, scenes. Captured using 3 different camera sensors, LENVIZ offers a wide range of lighting conditions, noise levels, and scene complexities, making it the largest publicly available up-to 4K resolution benchmark in the field. LENVIZ includes high quality human-generated ground truth, for which each multi-exposure low-light scene has been meticulously curated and edited by expert photographers to ensure optimal image quality. Furthermore, we also conduct a comprehensive analysis of current state-of-the-art low-light image enhancement techniques on our dataset and highlight potential areas of improvement.

# SeLIP: Similarity Enhanced Contrastive Language Image Pretraining for Multi-modal Head MRI 

**Authors**: Zhiyang Liu, Dong Yang, Minghao Zhang, Hanyu Sun, Hong Wu, Huiying Wang, Wen Shen, Chao Chai, Shuang Xia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19801)  

**Abstract**: Despite that deep learning (DL) methods have presented tremendous potential in many medical image analysis tasks, the practical applications of medical DL models are limited due to the lack of enough data samples with manual annotations. By noting that the clinical radiology examinations are associated with radiology reports that describe the images, we propose to develop a foundation model for multi-model head MRI by using contrastive learning on the images and the corresponding radiology findings. In particular, a contrastive learning framework is proposed, where a mixed syntax and semantic similarity matching metric is integrated to reduce the thirst of extreme large dataset in conventional contrastive learning framework. Our proposed similarity enhanced contrastive language image pretraining (SeLIP) is able to effectively extract more useful features. Experiments revealed that our proposed SeLIP performs well in many downstream tasks including image-text retrieval task, classification task, and image segmentation, which highlights the importance of considering the similarities among texts describing different images in developing medical image foundation models.

# PAVE: Patching and Adapting Video Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Zhuoming Liu, Yiquan Li, Khoi Duc Nguyen, Yiwu Zhong, Yin Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19794)  

**Abstract**: Pre-trained video large language models (Video LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet adapting these models to new tasks involving additional modalities or data types (e.g., audio or 3D information) remains challenging. In this paper, we present PAVE, a flexible framework for adapting pre-trained Video LLMs to downstream tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio, 3D cues, or multi-view videos. PAVE introduces lightweight adapters, referred to as "patches," which add a small number of parameters and operations to a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In doing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support diverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D reasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video understanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance of the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while incurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters. Further, PAVE supports multi-task learning and generalizes well across different Video LLMs. Our code is available at this https URL.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19786)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Gemma 3, a multimodal addition to the Gemma family of lightweight open models, ranging in scale from 1 to 27 billion parameters. This version introduces vision understanding abilities, a wider coverage of languages and longer context - at least 128K tokens. We also change the architecture of the model to reduce the KV-cache memory that tends to explode with long context. This is achieved by increasing the ratio of local to global attention layers, and keeping the span on local attention short. The Gemma 3 models are trained with distillation and achieve superior performance to Gemma 2 for both pre-trained and instruction finetuned versions. In particular, our novel post-training recipe significantly improves the math, chat, instruction-following and multilingual abilities, making Gemma3-4B-IT competitive with Gemma2-27B-IT and Gemma3-27B-IT comparable to Gemini-1.5-Pro across benchmarks. We release all our models to the community.

# A Survey on Event-driven 3D Reconstruction: Development under Different Categories 

**Authors**: Chuanzhi Xu, Haoxian Zhou, Haodong Chen, Vera Chung, Qiang Qu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19753)  

**Abstract**: Event cameras have gained increasing attention for 3D reconstruction due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. They capture per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously, allowing accurate reconstruction under fast motion and challenging lighting conditions. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of event-driven 3D reconstruction methods, including stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems. We further categorize recent developments based on geometric, learning-based, and hybrid approaches. Emerging trends, such as neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian splatting with event data, are also covered. The related works are structured chronologically to illustrate the innovations and progression within the field. To support future research, we also highlight key research gaps and future research directions in dataset, experiment, evaluation, event representation, etc.

# CamSAM2: Segment Anything Accurately in Camouflaged Videos 

**Authors**: Yuli Zhou, Guolei Sun, Yawei Li, Yuqian Fu, Luca Benini, Ender Konukoglu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19730)  

**Abstract**: Video camouflaged object segmentation (VCOS), aiming at segmenting camouflaged objects that seamlessly blend into their environment, is a fundamental vision task with various real-world applications. With the release of SAM2, video segmentation has witnessed significant progress. However, SAM2's capability of segmenting camouflaged videos is suboptimal, especially when given simple prompts such as point and box. To address the problem, we propose Camouflaged SAM2 (CamSAM2), which enhances SAM2's ability to handle camouflaged scenes without modifying SAM2's parameters. Specifically, we introduce a decamouflaged token to provide the flexibility of feature adjustment for VCOS. To make full use of fine-grained and high-resolution features from the current frame and previous frames, we propose implicit object-aware fusion (IOF) and explicit object-aware fusion (EOF) modules, respectively. Object prototype generation (OPG) is introduced to abstract and memorize object prototypes with informative details using high-quality features from previous frames. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach. While CamSAM2 only adds negligible learnable parameters to SAM2, it substantially outperforms SAM2 on three VCOS datasets, especially achieving 12.2 mDice gains with click prompt on MoCA-Mask and 19.6 mDice gains with mask prompt on SUN-SEG-Hard, with Hiera-T as the backbone. The code will be available at \href{this https URL}{this http URL}.

# On What Depends the Robustness of Multi-source Models to Missing Data in Earth Observation? 

**Authors**: Francisco Mena, Diego Arenas, Miro Miranda, Andreas Dengel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19719)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, the development of robust multi-source models has emerged in the Earth Observation (EO) field. These are models that leverage data from diverse sources to improve predictive accuracy when there is missing data. Despite these advancements, the factors influencing the varying effectiveness of such models remain poorly understood. In this study, we evaluate the predictive performance of six state-of-the-art multi-source models in predicting scenarios where either a single data source is missing or only a single source is available. Our analysis reveals that the efficacy of these models is intricately tied to the nature of the task, the complementarity among data sources, and the model design. Surprisingly, we observe instances where the removal of certain data sources leads to improved predictive performance, challenging the assumption that incorporating all available data is always beneficial. These findings prompt critical reflections on model complexity and the necessity of all collected data sources, potentially shaping the way for more streamlined approaches in EO applications.

# Invertible Koopman neural operator for data-driven modeling of partial differential equations 

**Authors**: Yuhong Jin, Andong Cong, Lei Hou, Qiang Gao, Xiangdong Ge, Chonglong Zhu, Yongzhi Feng, Jun Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19717)  

**Abstract**: Koopman operator theory is a popular candidate for data-driven modeling because it provides a global linearization representation for nonlinear dynamical systems. However, existing Koopman operator-based methods suffer from shortcomings in constructing the well-behaved observable function and its inverse and are inefficient enough when dealing with partial differential equations (PDEs). To address these issues, this paper proposes the Invertible Koopman Neural Operator (IKNO), a novel data-driven modeling approach inspired by the Koopman operator theory and neural operator. IKNO leverages an Invertible Neural Network to parameterize observable function and its inverse simultaneously under the same learnable parameters, explicitly guaranteeing the reconstruction relation, thus eliminating the dependency on the reconstruction loss, which is an essential improvement over the original Koopman Neural Operator (KNO). The structured linear matrix inspired by the Koopman operator theory is parameterized to learn the evolution of observables' low-frequency modes in the frequency space rather than directly in the observable space, sustaining IKNO is resolution-invariant like other neural operators. Moreover, with preprocessing such as interpolation and dimension expansion, IKNO can be extended to operator learning tasks defined on non-Cartesian domains. We fully support the above claims based on rich numerical and real-world examples and demonstrate the effectiveness of IKNO and superiority over other neural operators.

# Decoupled Dynamics Framework with Neural Fields for 3D Spatio-temporal Prediction of Vehicle Collisions 

**Authors**: Sanghyuk Kim, Minsik Seo, Namwoo Kang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19712)  

**Abstract**: This study proposes a neural framework that predicts 3D vehicle collision dynamics by independently modeling global rigid-body motion and local structural deformation. Unlike approaches directly predicting absolute displacement, this method explicitly separates the vehicle's overall translation and rotation from its structural deformation. Two specialized networks form the core of the framework: a quaternion-based Rigid Net for rigid motion and a coordinate-based Deformation Net for local deformation. By independently handling fundamentally distinct physical phenomena, the proposed architecture achieves accurate predictions without requiring separate supervision for each component. The model, trained on only 10% of available simulation data, significantly outperforms baseline models, including single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and deep operator networks (DeepONet), with prediction errors reduced by up to 83%. Extensive validation demonstrates strong generalization to collision conditions outside the training range, accurately predicting responses even under severe impacts involving extreme velocities and large impact angles. Furthermore, the framework successfully reconstructs high-resolution deformation details from low-resolution inputs without increased computational effort. Consequently, the proposed approach provides an effective, computationally efficient method for rapid and reliable assessment of vehicle safety across complex collision scenarios, substantially reducing the required simulation data and time while preserving prediction fidelity.

# Writing as a testbed for open ended agents 

**Authors**: Sian Gooding, Lucia Lopez-Rivilla, Edward Grefenstette  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19711)  

**Abstract**: Open-ended tasks are particularly challenging for LLMs due to the vast solution space, demanding both expansive exploration and adaptable strategies, especially when success lacks a clear, objective definition. Writing, with its vast solution space and subjective evaluation criteria, provides a compelling testbed for studying such problems. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs to act as collaborative co-writers, capable of suggesting and implementing text improvements autonomously. We analyse three prominent LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4o - focusing on how their action diversity, human alignment, and iterative improvement capabilities impact overall performance. This work establishes a framework for benchmarking autonomous writing agents and, more broadly, highlights fundamental challenges and potential solutions for building systems capable of excelling in diverse open-ended domains.

# Bootstrap Your Own Views: Masked Ego-Exo Modeling for Fine-grained View-invariant Video Representations 

**Authors**: Jungin Park, Jiyoung Lee, Kwanghoon Sohn  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19706)  

**Abstract**: View-invariant representation learning from egocentric (first-person, ego) and exocentric (third-person, exo) videos is a promising approach toward generalizing video understanding systems across multiple viewpoints. However, this area has been underexplored due to the substantial differences in perspective, motion patterns, and context between ego and exo views. In this paper, we propose a novel masked ego-exo modeling that promotes both causal temporal dynamics and cross-view alignment, called Bootstrap Your Own Views (BYOV), for fine-grained view-invariant video representation learning from unpaired ego-exo videos. We highlight the importance of capturing the compositional nature of human actions as a basis for robust cross-view understanding. Specifically, self-view masking and cross-view masking predictions are designed to learn view-invariant and powerful representations concurrently. Experimental results demonstrate that our BYOV significantly surpasses existing approaches with notable gains across all metrics in four downstream ego-exo video tasks.

# Deep Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition: A CNN Approach Utilizing Mel Spectrograms 

**Authors**: Niketa Penumajji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19677)  

**Abstract**: This paper explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks CNNs for classifying emotions in speech through Mel Spectrogram representations of audio files. Traditional methods such as Gaussian Mixture Models and Hidden Markov Models have proven insufficient for practical deployment, prompting a shift towards deep learning techniques. By transforming audio data into a visual format, the CNN model autonomously learns to identify intricate patterns, enhancing classification accuracy. The developed model is integrated into a user-friendly graphical interface, facilitating realtime predictions and potential applications in educational environments. The study aims to advance the understanding of deep learning in speech emotion recognition, assess the models feasibility, and contribute to the integration of technology in learning contexts

# BiblioPage: A Dataset of Scanned Title Pages for Bibliographic Metadata Extraction 

**Authors**: Jan Kohút, Martin Dočekal, Michal Hradiš, Marek Vaško  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19658)  

**Abstract**: Manual digitization of bibliographic metadata is time consuming and labor intensive, especially for historical and real-world archives with highly variable formatting across documents. Despite advances in machine learning, the absence of dedicated datasets for metadata extraction hinders automation. To address this gap, we introduce BiblioPage, a dataset of scanned title pages annotated with structured bibliographic metadata. The dataset consists of approximately 2,000 monograph title pages collected from 14 Czech libraries, spanning a wide range of publication periods, typographic styles, and layout structures. Each title page is annotated with 16 bibliographic attributes, including title, contributors, and publication metadata, along with precise positional information in the form of bounding boxes. To extract structured information from this dataset, we valuated object detection models such as YOLO and DETR combined with transformer-based OCR, achieving a maximum mAP of 52 and an F1 score of 59. Additionally, we assess the performance of various visual large language models, including LlamA 3.2-Vision and GPT-4o, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 67. BiblioPage serves as a real-world benchmark for bibliographic metadata extraction, contributing to document understanding, document question answering, and document information extraction.

# Towards Reliable Time Series Forecasting under Future Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Novelty Rejection Mechanisms 

**Authors**: Ninghui Feng, Songning Lai, Xin Zhou, Jiayu Yang, Kunlong Feng, Zhenxiao Yin, Fobao Zhou, Zhangyi Hu, Yutao Yue, Yuxuan Liang, Boyu Wang, Hang Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19656)  

**Abstract**: In real-world time series forecasting, uncertainty and lack of reliable evaluation pose significant challenges. Notably, forecasting errors often arise from underfitting in-distribution data and failing to handle out-of-distribution inputs. To enhance model reliability, we introduce a dual rejection mechanism combining ambiguity and novelty rejection. Ambiguity rejection, using prediction error variance, allows the model to abstain under low confidence, assessed through historical error variance analysis without future ground truth. Novelty rejection, employing Variational Autoencoders and Mahalanobis distance, detects deviations from training data. This dual approach improves forecasting reliability in dynamic environments by reducing errors and adapting to data changes, advancing reliability in complex scenarios.

# RGB-Th-Bench: A Dense benchmark for Visual-Thermal Understanding of Vision Language Models 

**Authors**: Mehdi Moshtaghi, Siavash H. Khajavi, Joni Pajarinen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19654)  

**Abstract**: We introduce RGB-Th-Bench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to comprehend RGB-Thermal image pairs. While VLMs have demonstrated remarkable progress in visual reasoning and multimodal understanding, their evaluation has been predominantly limited to RGB-based benchmarks, leaving a critical gap in assessing their capabilities in infrared vision tasks. Existing visible-infrared datasets are either task-specific or lack high-quality annotations necessary for rigorous model evaluation. To address these limitations, RGB-Th-Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework covering 14 distinct skill dimensions, with a total of 1,600+ expert-annotated Yes/No questions. The benchmark employs two accuracy metrics: a standard question-level accuracy and a stricter skill-level accuracy, which evaluates model robustness across multiple questions within each skill dimension. This design ensures a thorough assessment of model performance, including resilience to adversarial and hallucinated responses. We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 state-of-the-art VLMs, revealing significant performance gaps in RGB-Thermal understanding. Our results show that even the strongest models struggle with thermal image comprehension, with performance heavily constrained by their RGB-based capabilities. Additionally, the lack of large-scale application-specific and expert-annotated thermal-caption-pair datasets in pre-training is an important reason of the observed performance gap. RGB-Th-Bench highlights the urgent need for further advancements in multimodal learning to bridge the gap between visible and thermal image understanding. The dataset is available through this link, and the evaluation code will also be made publicly available.

# OpenSDI: Spotting Diffusion-Generated Images in the Open World 

**Authors**: Yabin Wang, Zhiwu Huang, Xiaopeng Hong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19653)  

**Abstract**: This paper identifies OpenSDI, a challenge for spotting diffusion-generated images in open-world settings. In response to this challenge, we define a new benchmark, the OpenSDI dataset (OpenSDID), which stands out from existing datasets due to its diverse use of large vision-language models that simulate open-world diffusion-based manipulations. Another outstanding feature of OpenSDID is its inclusion of both detection and localization tasks for images manipulated globally and locally by diffusion models. To address the OpenSDI challenge, we propose a Synergizing Pretrained Models (SPM) scheme to build up a mixture of foundation models. This approach exploits a collaboration mechanism with multiple pretrained foundation models to enhance generalization in the OpenSDI context, moving beyond traditional training by synergizing multiple pretrained models through prompting and attending strategies. Building on this scheme, we introduce MaskCLIP, an SPM-based model that aligns Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) with Masked Autoencoder (MAE). Extensive evaluations on OpenSDID show that MaskCLIP significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for the OpenSDI challenge, achieving remarkable relative improvements of 14.23% in IoU (14.11% in F1) and 2.05% in accuracy (2.38% in F1) compared to the second-best model in localization and detection tasks, respectively. Our dataset and code are available at this https URL.

# HausaNLP at SemEval-2025 Task 3: Towards a Fine-Grained Model-Aware Hallucination Detection 

**Authors**: Maryam Bala, Amina Imam Abubakar, Abdulhamid Abubakar, Abdulkadir Shehu Bichi, Hafsa Kabir Ahmad, Sani Abdullahi Sani, Idris Abdulmumin, Shamsuddeen Hassan Muhamad, Ibrahim Said Ahmad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19650)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents our findings of the Multilingual Shared Task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, MU-SHROOM, which focuses on identifying hallucinations and related overgeneration errors in large language models (LLMs). The shared task involves detecting specific text spans that constitute hallucinations in the outputs generated by LLMs in 14 languages. To address this task, we aim to provide a nuanced, model-aware understanding of hallucination occurrences and severity in English. We used natural language inference and fine-tuned a ModernBERT model using a synthetic dataset of 400 samples, achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.032 and a correlation score of 0.422. These results indicate a moderately positive correlation between the model's confidence scores and the actual presence of hallucinations. The IoU score indicates that our model has a relatively low overlap between the predicted hallucination span and the truth annotation. The performance is unsurprising, given the intricate nature of hallucination detection. Hallucinations often manifest subtly, relying on context, making pinpointing their exact boundaries formidable.

# Recover from Horcrux: A Spectrogram Augmentation Method for Cardiac Feature Monitoring from Radar Signal Components 

**Authors**: Yuanyuan Zhang, Sijie Xiong, Rui Yang, EngGee Lim, Yutao Yue  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19649)  

**Abstract**: Radar-based wellness monitoring is becoming an effective measurement to provide accurate vital signs in a contactless manner, but data scarcity retards the related research on deep-learning-based methods. Data augmentation is commonly used to enrich the dataset by modifying the existing data, but most augmentation techniques can only couple with classification tasks. To enable the augmentation for regression tasks, this research proposes a spectrogram augmentation method, Horcrux, for radar-based cardiac feature monitoring (e.g., heartbeat detection, electrocardiogram reconstruction) with both classification and regression tasks involved. The proposed method is designed to increase the diversity of input samples while the augmented spectrogram is still faithful to the original ground truth vital sign. In addition, Horcrux proposes to inject zero values in specific areas to enhance the awareness of the deep learning model on subtle cardiac features, improving the performance for the limited dataset. Experimental result shows that Horcrux achieves an overall improvement of 16.20% in cardiac monitoring and has the potential to be extended to other spectrogram-based tasks. The code will be released upon publication.

# Show or Tell? Effectively prompting Vision-Language Models for semantic segmentation 

**Authors**: Niccolo Avogaro, Thomas Frick, Mattia Rigotti, Andrea Bartezzaghi, Filip Janicki, Cristiano Malossi, Konrad Schindler, Roy Assaf  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19647)  

**Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being regarded as foundation models that can be instructed to solve diverse tasks by prompting, without task-specific training. We examine the seemingly obvious question: how to effectively prompt VLMs for semantic segmentation. To that end, we systematically evaluate the segmentation performance of several recent models guided by either text or visual prompts on the out-of-distribution MESS dataset collection. We introduce a scalable prompting scheme, few-shot prompted semantic segmentation, inspired by open-vocabulary segmentation and few-shot learning. It turns out that VLMs lag far behind specialist models trained for a specific segmentation task, by about 30% on average on the Intersection-over-Union metric. Moreover, we find that text prompts and visual prompts are complementary: each one of the two modes fails on many examples that the other one can solve. Our analysis suggests that being able to anticipate the most effective prompt modality can lead to a 11% improvement in performance. Motivated by our findings, we propose PromptMatcher, a remarkably simple training-free baseline that combines both text and visual prompts, achieving state-of-the-art results outperforming the best text-prompted VLM by 2.5%, and the top visual-prompted VLM by 3.5% on few-shot prompted semantic segmentation.

# Analyzable Chain-of-Musical-Thought Prompting for High-Fidelity Music Generation 

**Authors**: Max W. Y. Lam, Yijin Xing, Weiya You, Jingcheng Wu, Zongyu Yin, Fuqiang Jiang, Hangyu Liu, Feng Liu, Xingda Li, Wei-Tsung Lu, Hanyu Chen, Tong Feng, Tianwei Zhao, Chien-Hung Liu, Xuchen Song, Yang Li, Yahui Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19611)  

**Abstract**: Autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-fidelity music. However, the conventional next-token prediction paradigm in AR models does not align with the human creative process in music composition, potentially compromising the musicality of generated samples. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MusiCoT, a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique tailored for music generation. MusiCoT empowers the AR model to first outline an overall music structure before generating audio tokens, thereby enhancing the coherence and creativity of the resulting compositions. By leveraging the contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) model, we establish a chain of "musical thoughts", making MusiCoT scalable and independent of human-labeled data, in contrast to conventional CoT methods. Moreover, MusiCoT allows for in-depth analysis of music structure, such as instrumental arrangements, and supports music referencing -- accepting variable-length audio inputs as optional style references. This innovative approach effectively addresses copying issues, positioning MusiCoT as a vital practical method for music prompting. Our experimental results indicate that MusiCoT consistently achieves superior performance across both objective and subjective metrics, producing music quality that rivals state-of-the-art generation models.

# Enabling Rapid Shared Human-AI Mental Model Alignment via the After-Action Review 

**Authors**: Edward Gu, Ho Chit Siu, Melanie Platt, Isabelle Hurley, Jaime Peña, Rohan Paleja  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19607)  

**Abstract**: In this work, we present two novel contributions toward improving research in human-machine teaming (HMT): 1) a Minecraft testbed to accelerate testing and deployment of collaborative AI agents and 2) a tool to allow users to revisit and analyze behaviors within an HMT episode to facilitate shared mental model development. Our browser-based Minecraft testbed allows for rapid testing of collaborative agents in a continuous-space, real-time, partially-observable environment with real humans without cumbersome setup typical to human-AI interaction user studies. As Minecraft has an extensive player base and a rich ecosystem of pre-built AI agents, we hope this contribution can help to facilitate research quickly in the design of new collaborative agents and in understanding different human factors within HMT. Our mental model alignment tool facilitates user-led post-mission analysis by including video displays of first-person perspectives of the team members (i.e., the human and AI) that can be replayed, and a chat interface that leverages GPT-4 to provide answers to various queries regarding the AI's experiences and model details.

# HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural Language 

**Authors**: Dimitrios Stamatios Bouras, Yihan Dai, Tairan Wang, Yingfei Xiong, Sergey Mechtaev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19599)  

**Abstract**: While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against natural language requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program analysis and verification to natural language artifacts. Drawing inspiration from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various points in the code. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 62% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by increasing the MCC by 93%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 28% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.

# A Contradiction-Centered Model for the Emergence of Swarm Intelligence 

**Authors**: Wenpin Jiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19585)  

**Abstract**: The phenomenon of emergence of swarm intelligence exists widely in nature and human society. People have been exploring the root cause of emergence of swarm intelligence and trying to establish general theories and models for emergence of swarm intelligence. However, the existing theories or models do not grasp the essence of swarm intelligence, so they lack generality and are difficult to explain various phenomena of emergence of swarm intelligence. In this paper, a contradiction-centered model for the emergence of swarm intelligence is proposed, in which the internal contradictions of individuals determine their behavior and properties, individuals are related and interact within the swarm because of competing and occupying environmental resources, interactions and swarm potential affect the internal contradictions of individuals and their distribution in the swarm, and the swarm intelligence is manifested as the specific distribution of individual contradictions. This model completely explains the conditions, dynamics, pathways, formations and processes of the emergence of swarm intelligence. In order to verify the validity of this model, several swarm intelligence systems are implemented and analyzed in this paper. The experimental results show that the model has good generality and can be used to describe the emergence of various swarm intelligence.

# FedMM-X: A Trustworthy and Interpretable Framework for Federated Multi-Modal Learning in Dynamic Environments 

**Authors**: Sree Bhargavi Balija

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly operate in Real-world environments, the integration of multi-modal data sources such as vision, language, and audio presents both unprecedented opportunities and critical challenges for achieving trustworthy intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies federated learning with explainable multi-modal reasoning to ensure trustworthiness in decentralized, dynamic settings. Our approach, called FedMM-X (Federated Multi-Modal Explainable Intelligence), leverages cross-modal consistency checks, client-level interpretability mechanisms, and dynamic trust calibration to address challenges posed by data heterogeneity, modality imbalance, and out-of-distribution generalization. Through rigorous evaluation across federated multi-modal benchmarks involving vision-language tasks, we demonstrate improved performance in both accuracy and interpretability while reducing vulnerabilities to adversarial and spurious correlations. Further, we introduce a novel trust score aggregation method to quantify global model reliability under dynamic client participation. Our findings pave the way toward developing robust, interpretable, and socially responsible AI systems in Real-world environments.

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, largely driven by high-quality web data used in pre-training. However, recent studies indicate this data source is rapidly depleting. Synthetic data emerges as a promising alternative, but it remains unclear whether synthetic datasets exhibit predictable scalability comparable to raw pre-training data. In this work, we systematically investigate the scaling laws of synthetic data by introducing SynthLLM, a scalable framework that transforms pre-training corpora into diverse, high-quality synthetic datasets. Our approach achieves this by automatically extracting and recombining high-level concepts across multiple documents using a graph algorithm. Key findings from our extensive mathematical experiments on SynthLLM include: (1) SynthLLM generates synthetic data that reliably adheres to the \emph{rectified scaling law} across various model sizes; (2) Performance improvements plateau near 300B tokens; and (3) Larger models approach optimal performance with fewer training tokens. For instance, an 8B model peaks at 1T tokens, while a 3B model requires 4T. Moreover, comparisons with existing synthetic data generation and augmentation methods demonstrate that SynthLLM achieves superior performance and scalability. Our findings highlight synthetic data as a scalable and reliable alternative to organic pre-training corpora, offering a viable path toward continued improvement in model performance.

# FLEX: A Benchmark for Evaluating Robustness of Fairness in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Dahyun Jung, Seungyoon Lee, Hyeonseok Moon, Chanjun Park, Heuiseok Lim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19540)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced interactions between users and models. These advancements concurrently underscore the need for rigorous safety evaluations due to the manifestation of social biases, which can lead to harmful societal impacts. Despite these concerns, existing benchmarks may overlook the intrinsic weaknesses of LLMs, which can generate biased responses even with simple adversarial instructions. To address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can sustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify potential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between FLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may underestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more stringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.

# VectorFit : Adaptive Singular & Bias Vector Fine-Tuning of Pre-trained Foundation Models 

**Authors**: Suhas G Hegde, Shilpy Kaur, Aruna Tiwari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19530)  

**Abstract**: Popular PEFT methods achieve parameter efficiency by assuming that incremental weight updates are inherently low-rank, which often leads to a performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. While recent methods have attempted to address this limitation, they typically lack sufficient parameter and memory efficiency. We propose VectorFit, an effective and easily deployable approach that adaptively trains the singular vectors and biases of pre-trained weight matrices. We demonstrate that the utilization of structural and transformational characteristics of pre-trained weights enables high-rank updates comparable to those of full fine-tuning. As a result, VectorFit achieves superior performance with 9X less trainable parameters compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Through extensive experiments over 17 datasets spanning diverse language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we exhibit that VectorFit consistently outperforms baselines, even in extremely low-budget scenarios.

# RoboFlamingo-Plus: Fusion of Depth and RGB Perception with Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Robotic Manipulation 

**Authors**: Sheng Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19510)  

**Abstract**: As robotic technologies advancing towards more complex multimodal interactions and manipulation tasks, the integration of advanced Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has become a key driver in the field. Despite progress with current methods, challenges persist in fusing depth and RGB information within 3D environments and executing tasks guided by linguistic instructions. In response to these challenges, we have enhanced the existing RoboFlamingo framework by introducing RoboFlamingo-Plus, which incorporates depth data into VLMs to significantly improve robotic manipulation performance. Our research achieves a nuanced fusion of RGB and depth information by integrating a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) with a resampling technique, closely aligning this combined data with linguistic cues for superior multimodal understanding. The novelty of RoboFlamingo-Plus lies in its adaptation of inputs for depth data processing, leveraging a pre-trained resampler for depth feature extraction, and employing cross-attention mechanisms for optimal feature integration. These improvements allow RoboFlamingo-Plus to not only deeply understand 3D environments but also easily perform complex, language-guided tasks in challenging settings. Experimental results show that RoboFlamingo-Plus boosts robotic manipulation by 10-20% over current methods, marking a significant advancement. Codes and model weights are public at RoboFlamingo-Plus.

# Towards Long-Range ENSO Prediction with an Explainable Deep Learning Model 

**Authors**: Qi Chen, Yinghao Cui, Guobin Hong, Karumuri Ashok, Yuchun Pu, Xiaogu Zheng, Xuanze Zhang, Wei Zhong, Peng Zhan, Zhonglei Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19502)  

**Abstract**: El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a prominent mode of interannual climate variability with far-reaching global impacts. Its evolution is governed by intricate air-sea interactions, posing significant challenges for long-term prediction. In this study, we introduce CTEFNet, a multivariate deep learning model that synergizes convolutional neural networks and transformers to enhance ENSO forecasting. By integrating multiple oceanic and atmospheric predictors, CTEFNet extends the effective forecast lead time to 20 months while mitigating the impact of the spring predictability barrier, outperforming both dynamical models and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Furthermore, CTEFNet offers physically meaningful and statistically significant insights through gradient-based sensitivity analysis, revealing the key precursor signals that govern ENSO dynamics, which align with well-established theories and reveal new insights about inter-basin interactions among the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The CTEFNet's superior predictive skill and interpretable sensitivity assessments underscore its potential for advancing climate prediction. Our findings highlight the importance of multivariate coupling in ENSO evolution and demonstrate the promise of deep learning in capturing complex climate dynamics with enhanced interpretability.

# Pose-Based Fall Detection System: Efficient Monitoring on Standard CPUs 

**Authors**: Vinayak Mali, Saurabh Jaiswal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19501)  

**Abstract**: Falls among elderly residents in assisted living homes pose significant health risks, often leading to injuries and a decreased quality of life. Current fall detection solutions typically rely on sensor-based systems that require dedicated hardware, or on video-based models that demand high computational resources and GPUs for real-time processing. In contrast, this paper presents a robust fall detection system that does not require any additional sensors or high-powered hardware. The system uses pose estimation techniques, combined with threshold-based analysis and a voting mechanism, to effectively distinguish between fall and non-fall activities. For pose detection, we leverage MediaPipe, a lightweight and efficient framework that enables real-time processing on standard CPUs with minimal computational overhead. By analyzing motion, body position, and key pose points, the system processes pose features with a 20-frame buffer, minimizing false positives and maintaining high accuracy even in real-world settings. This unobtrusive, resource-efficient approach provides a practical solution for enhancing resident safety in old age homes, without the need for expensive sensors or high-end computational resources.

**Authors**: Mohammad Daffa Robani, Paul Saves, Pramudita Satria Palar, Lavi Rizki Zuhal, oseph Morlier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19496)  

**Abstract**: Surrogate models are of high interest for many engineering applications, serving as cheap-to-evaluate time-efficient approximations of black-box functions to help engineers and practitioners make decisions and understand complex systems. As such, the need for explainability methods is rising and many studies have been performed to facilitate knowledge discovery from surrogate models. To respond to these enquiries, this paper introduces SMT-EX, an enhancement of the open-source Python Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT) that integrates explainability techniques into a state-of-the-art surrogate modelling framework. More precisely, SMT-EX includes three key explainability methods: Shapley Additive Explanations, Partial Dependence Plot, and Individual Conditional Expectations. A peculiar explainability dependency of SMT has been developed for such purpose that can be easily activated once the surrogate model is built, offering a user-friendly and efficient tool for swift insight extraction. The effectiveness of SMT-EX is showcased through two test cases. The first case is a 10-variable wing weight problem with purely continuous variables and the second one is a 3-variable mixed-categorical cantilever beam bending problem. Relying on SMT-EX analyses for these problems, we demonstrate its versatility in addressing a diverse range of problem characteristics. SMT-Explainability is freely available on Github: this https URL .

# A-MESS: Anchor based Multimodal Embedding with Semantic Synchronization for Multimodal Intent Recognition 

**Authors**: Yaomin Shen, Xiaojian Lin, Wei Fan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19474)  

**Abstract**: In the domain of multimodal intent recognition (MIR), the objective is to recognize human intent by integrating a variety of modalities, such as language text, body gestures, and tones. However, existing approaches face difficulties adequately capturing the intrinsic connections between the modalities and overlooking the corresponding semantic representations of intent. To address these limitations, we present the Anchor-based Mul- timodal Embedding with Semantic Synchronization (A-MESS) framework. We first design an Anchor-based Multimodal Embed- ding (A-ME) module that employs an anchor-based embedding fusion mechanism to integrate multimodal inputs. Furthermore, we develop a Semantic Synchronization (SS) strategy with the Triplet Contrastive Learning pipeline, which optimizes the pro- cess by synchronizing multimodal representation with label de- scriptions produced by the large language model. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our A-MESS achieves state-of-the-art and provides substantial insight into multimodal representation and downstream tasks.

# Enhancing Small Language Models for Cross-Lingual Generalized Zero-Shot Classification with Soft Prompt Tuning 

**Authors**: Fred Philippy, Siwen Guo, Cedric Lothritz, Jacques Klein, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19469)  

**Abstract**: In NLP, Zero-Shot Classification (ZSC) has become essential for enabling models to classify text into categories unseen during training, particularly in low-resource languages and domains where labeled data is scarce. While pretrained language models (PLMs) have shown promise in ZSC, they often rely on large training datasets or external knowledge, limiting their applicability in multilingual and low-resource scenarios. Recent approaches leveraging natural language prompts reduce the dependence on large training datasets but struggle to effectively incorporate available labeled data from related classification tasks, especially when these datasets originate from different languages or distributions. Moreover, existing prompt-based methods typically rely on manually crafted prompts in a specific language, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness in cross-lingual settings. To address these challenges, we introduce RoSPrompt, a lightweight and data-efficient approach for training soft prompts that enhance cross-lingual ZSC while ensuring robust generalization across data distribution shifts. RoSPrompt is designed for small multilingual PLMs, enabling them to leverage high-resource languages to improve performance in low-resource settings without requiring extensive fine-tuning or high computational costs. We evaluate our approach on multiple multilingual PLMs across datasets covering 106 languages, demonstrating strong cross-lingual transfer performance and robust generalization capabilities over unseen classes.

# Data-centric Federated Graph Learning with Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Bo Yan, Zhongjian Zhang, Huabin Sun, Mengmei Zhang, Yang Cao, Chuan Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19455)  

**Abstract**: In federated graph learning (FGL), a complete graph is divided into multiple subgraphs stored in each client due to privacy concerns, and all clients jointly train a global graph model by only transmitting model parameters. A pain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures present non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label distributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of FGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model level, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate heterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally address the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from scratch when transferring to other tasks. Motivated by large language models (LLMs) having achieved remarkable success, we aim to utilize LLMs to fully understand and augment local text-attributed graphs, to address data heterogeneity at the data level. In this paper, we propose a general framework LLM4FGL that innovatively decomposes the task of LLM for FGL into two sub-tasks theoretically. Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to generate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes and raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel federated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to modify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback from all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a pre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to advanced baselines.

# VecTrans: LLM Transformation Framework for Better Auto-vectorization on High-performance CPU 

**Authors**: Zhongchun Zheng, Long Cheng, Lu Li, Rodrigo C. O. Rocha, Tianyi Liu, Wei Wei, Xianwei Zhang, Yaoqing Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19449)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great capabilities in code generation, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. Vectorization, a crucial optimization for enhancing code performance, often fails because of the compiler's inability to recognize complex code patterns, which commonly require extensive empirical expertise. LLMs, with their ability to capture intricate patterns, thus providing a promising solution to this challenge. This paper presents VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compiler's auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. Experimental results show that among all 50 TSVC functions unvectorizable by Clang, GCC, and BiShengCompiler, VecTrans successfully vectorizes 23 cases (46%) and achieves an average speedup of 2.02x, greatly surpassing state-of-the-art performance.

# DeCAP: Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation for Debiasing Zero-shot Question Answering in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Suyoung Bae, YunSeok Choi, Jee-Hyong Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19426)  

**Abstract**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot Question Answering (QA), they tend to expose biases in their internal knowledge when faced with socially sensitive questions, leading to a degradation in performance. Existing zero-shot methods are efficient but fail to consider context and prevent bias propagation in the answers. To address this, we propose DeCAP, a method for debiasing LLMs using Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation. DeCAP leverages a Question Ambiguity Detection to take appropriate debiasing actions based on the context and a Neutral Answer Guidance Generation to suppress the LLMs make objective judgments about the context, minimizing the propagation of bias from their internal knowledge. Our various experiments across eight LLMs show that DeCAP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot debiased QA performance. This demonstrates DeCAP's efficacy in enhancing the fairness and accuracy of LLMs in diverse QA settings.

# Quantifying Symptom Causality in Clinical Decision Making: An Exploration Using CausaLM 

**Authors**: Mehul Shetty, Connor Jordan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19394)  

**Abstract**: Current machine learning approaches to medical diagnosis often rely on correlational patterns between symptoms and diseases, risking misdiagnoses when symptoms are ambiguous or common across multiple conditions. In this work, we move beyond correlation to investigate the causal influence of key symptoms-specifically "chest pain" on diagnostic predictions. Leveraging the CausaLM framework, we generate counterfactual text representations in which target concepts are effectively "forgotten" enabling a principled estimation of the causal effect of that concept on a model's predicted disease distribution. By employing Textual Representation-based Average Treatment Effect (TReATE), we quantify how the presence or absence of a symptom shapes the model's diagnostic outcomes, and contrast these findings against correlation-based baselines such as CONEXP. Our results offer deeper insight into the decision-making behavior of clinical NLP models and have the potential to inform more trustworthy, interpretable, and causally-grounded decision support tools in medical practice.

# Causal invariant geographic network representations with feature and structural distribution shifts 

**Authors**: Yuhan Wang, Silu He, Qinyao Luo, Hongyuan Yuan, Ling Zhao, Jiawei Zhu, Haifeng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19382)  

**Abstract**: The existing methods learn geographic network representations through deep graph neural networks (GNNs) based on the i.i.d. assumption. However, the spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of geographic data make the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation problem particularly salient. The latter are particularly sensitive to distribution shifts (feature and structural shifts) between testing and training data and are the main causes of the OOD generalisation problem. Spurious correlations are present between invariant and background representations due to selection biases and environmental effects, resulting in the model extremes being more likely to learn background representations. The existing approaches focus on background representation changes that are determined by shifts in the feature distributions of nodes in the training and test data while ignoring changes in the proportional distributions of heterogeneous and homogeneous neighbour nodes, which we refer to as structural distribution shifts. We propose a feature-structure mixed invariant representation learning (FSM-IRL) model that accounts for both feature distribution shifts and structural distribution shifts. To address structural distribution shifts, we introduce a sampling method based on causal attention, encouraging the model to identify nodes possessing strong causal relationships with labels or nodes that are more similar to the target node. Inspired by the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion, we implement a reweighting strategy to maximise the orthogonality of the node representations, thereby mitigating the spurious correlations among the node representations and suppressing the learning of background representations. Our experiments demonstrate that FSM-IRL exhibits strong learning capabilities on both geographic and social network datasets in OOD scenarios.

# DeClotH: Decomposable 3D Cloth and Human Body Reconstruction from a Single Image 

**Authors**: Hyeongjin Nam, Donghwan Kim, Jeongtaek Oh, Kyoung Mu Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19373)  

**Abstract**: Most existing methods of 3D clothed human reconstruction from a single image treat the clothed human as a single object without distinguishing between cloth and human body. In this regard, we present DeClotH, which separately reconstructs 3D cloth and human body from a single image. This task remains largely unexplored due to the extreme occlusion between cloth and the human body, making it challenging to infer accurate geometries and textures. Moreover, while recent 3D human reconstruction methods have achieved impressive results using text-to-image diffusion models, directly applying such an approach to this problem often leads to incorrect guidance, particularly in reconstructing 3D cloth. To address these challenges, we propose two core designs in our framework. First, to alleviate the occlusion issue, we leverage 3D template models of cloth and human body as regularizations, which provide strong geometric priors to prevent erroneous reconstruction by the occlusion. Second, we introduce a cloth diffusion model specifically designed to provide contextual information about cloth appearance, thereby enhancing the reconstruction of 3D cloth. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is highly effective in reconstructing both 3D cloth and the human body. More qualitative results are provided at this https URL.

# Flow to Learn: Flow Matching on Neural Network Parameters 

**Authors**: Daniel Saragih, Deyu Cao, Tejas Balaji, Ashwin Santhosh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19371)  

**Abstract**: Foundational language models show a remarkable ability to learn new concepts during inference via context data. However, similar work for images lag behind. To address this challenge, we introduce FLoWN, a flow matching model that learns to generate neural network parameters for different tasks. Our approach models the flow on latent space, while conditioning the process on context data. Experiments verify that FLoWN attains various desiderata for a meta-learning model. In addition, it matches or exceeds baselines on in-distribution tasks, provides better initializations for classifier training, and is performant on out-of-distribution few-shot tasks while having a fine-tuning mechanism to improve performance.

**Authors**: Amna Naeem, Muazzam A. Khan, Nada Alasbali, Jawad Ahmad, Aizaz Ahmad Khattak, Muhammad Shahbaz Khan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19339)  

**Abstract**: The ever-increasing security vulnerabilities in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems require improved threat detection approaches. This paper presents a compact and efficient approach to detect botnet attacks by employing an integrated approach that consists of traffic pattern analysis, temporal support learning, and focused feature extraction. The proposed attention-based model benefits from a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture and achieves 99% classification accuracy in detecting botnet attacks utilizing the N-BaIoT dataset, while maintaining high precision and recall across various scenarios. The proposed model's performance is further validated by key parameters, such as Mathews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's kappa Correlation Coefficient. The close-to-ideal results for these parameters demonstrate the proposed model's ability to detect botnet attacks accurately and efficiently in practical settings and on unseen data. The proposed model proved to be a powerful defense mechanism for IoT networks to face emerging security challenges.

# Wavelet-based Global-Local Interaction Network with Cross-Attention for Multi-View Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 

**Authors**: Yongting Hu, Yuxin Lin, Chengliang Liu, Xiaoling Luo, Xiaoyan Dou, Qihao Xu, Yong Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19329)  

**Abstract**: Multi-view diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection has recently emerged as a promising method to address the issue of incomplete lesions faced by single-view DR. However, it is still challenging due to the variable sizes and scattered locations of lesions. Furthermore, existing multi-view DR methods typically merge multiple views without considering the correlations and redundancies of lesion information across them. Therefore, we propose a novel method to overcome the challenges of difficult lesion information learning and inadequate multi-view fusion. Specifically, we introduce a two-branch network to obtain both local lesion features and their global dependencies. The high-frequency component of the wavelet transform is used to exploit lesion edge information, which is then enhanced by global semantic to facilitate difficult lesion learning. Additionally, we present a cross-view fusion module to improve multi-view fusion and reduce redundancy. Experimental results on large public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is open sourced on this https URL.

# Substance over Style: Evaluating Proactive Conversational Coaching Agents 

**Authors**: Vidya Srinivas, Xuhai Xu, Xin Liu, Kumar Ayush, Isaac Galatzer-Levy, Shwetak Patel, Daniel McDuff, Tim Althoff  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19328)  

**Abstract**: While NLP research has made strides in conversational tasks, many approaches focus on single-turn responses with well-defined objectives or evaluation criteria. In contrast, coaching presents unique challenges with initially undefined goals that evolve through multi-turn interactions, subjective evaluation criteria, mixed-initiative dialogue. In this work, we describe and implement five multi-turn coaching agents that exhibit distinct conversational styles, and evaluate them through a user study, collecting first-person feedback on 155 conversations. We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively. By comparing user feedback with third-person evaluations from health experts and an LM, we reveal significant misalignment across evaluation approaches. Our findings provide insights into design and evaluation of conversational coaching agents and contribute toward improving human-centered NLP applications.

# LRSCLIP: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Aligning Remote Sensing Image with Longer Text 

**Authors**: Weizhi Chen, Jingbo Chen, Yupeng Deng, Jiansheng Chen, Yuman Feng, Zhihao Xi, Diyou Liu, Kai Li, Yu Meng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19311)  

**Abstract**: This study addresses the technical bottlenecks in handling long text and the "hallucination" issue caused by insufficient short text information in remote sensing vision-language foundation models (VLFM). We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning. The related code has been open source and is available at this https URL.

# Adaptive Wavelet Filters as Practical Texture Feature Amplifiers for Parkinson's Disease Screening in OCT 

**Authors**: Xiaoqing Zhang, Hanfeng Shi, Xiangyu Li, Haili Ye, Tao Xu, Na Li, Yan Hu, Fan Lv, Jiangfan Chen, Jiang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19292)  

**Abstract**: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder globally. The eye's retina is an extension of the brain and has great potential in PD screening. Recent studies have suggested that texture features extracted from retinal layers can be adopted as biomarkers for PD diagnosis under optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Frequency domain learning techniques can enhance the feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs) by decomposing frequency components involving rich texture features. Additionally, previous works have not exploited texture features for automated PD screening in OCT. Motivated by the above analysis, we propose a novel Adaptive Wavelet Filter (AWF) that serves as the Practical Texture Feature Amplifier to fully leverage the merits of texture features to boost the PD screening performance of DNNs with the aid of frequency domain learning. Specifically, AWF first enhances texture feature representation diversities via channel mixer, then emphasizes informative texture feature representations with the well-designed adaptive wavelet filtering token mixer. By combining the AWFs with the DNN stem, AWFNet is constructed for automated PD screening. Additionally, we introduce a novel Balanced Confidence (BC) Loss by mining the potential of sample-wise predicted probabilities of all classes and class frequency prior, to further boost the PD screening performance and trustworthiness of AWFNet. The extensive experiments manifest the superiority of our AWFNet and BC over state-of-the-art methods in terms of PD screening performance and trustworthiness.

# No Black Box Anymore: Demystifying Clinical Predictive Modeling with Temporal-Feature Cross Attention Mechanism 

**Authors**: Yubo Li, Xinyu Yao, Rema Padman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19285)  

**Abstract**: Despite the outstanding performance of deep learning models in clinical prediction tasks, explainability remains a significant challenge. Inspired by transformer architectures, we introduce the Temporal-Feature Cross Attention Mechanism (TFCAM), a novel deep learning framework designed to capture dynamic interactions among clinical features across time, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In an experiment with 1,422 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, predicting progression to End-Stage Renal Disease, TFCAM outperformed LSTM and RETAIN baselines, achieving an AUROC of 0.95 and an F1-score of 0.69. Beyond performance gains, TFCAM provides multi-level explainability by identifying critical temporal periods, ranking feature importance, and quantifying how features influence each other across time before affecting predictions. Our approach addresses the "black box" limitations of deep learning in healthcare, offering clinicians transparent insights into disease progression mechanisms while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance.

# CubeRobot: Grounding Language in Rubik's Cube Manipulation via Vision-Language Model 

**Authors**: Feiyang Wang, Xiaomin Yu, Wangyu Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19281)  

**Abstract**: Proving Rubik's Cube theorems at the high level represents a notable milestone in human-level spatial imagination and logic thinking and reasoning. Traditional Rubik's Cube robots, relying on complex vision systems and fixed algorithms, often struggle to adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we introduce CubeRobot, a novel vision-language model (VLM) tailored for solving 3x3 Rubik's Cubes, empowering embodied agents with multimodal understanding and execution capabilities. We used the CubeCoT image dataset, which contains multiple-level tasks (43 subtasks in total) that humans are unable to handle, encompassing various cube states. We incorporate a dual-loop VisionCoT architecture and Memory Stream, a paradigm for extracting task-related features from VLM-generated planning queries, thus enabling CubeRobot to independent planning, decision-making, reflection and separate management of high- and low-level Rubik's Cube tasks. Furthermore, in low-level Rubik's Cube restoration tasks, CubeRobot achieved a high accuracy rate of 100%, similar to 100% in medium-level tasks, and achieved an accuracy rate of 80% in high-level tasks.

# LogicLearner: A Tool for the Guided Practice of Propositional Logic Proofs 

**Authors**: Amogh Inamdar, Uzay Macar, Michel Vazirani, Michael Tarnow, Zarina Mustapha, Natalia Dittren, Sam Sadeh, Nakul Verma, Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19280)  

**Abstract**: The study of propositional logic -- fundamental to the theory of computing -- is a cornerstone of the undergraduate computer science curriculum. Learning to solve logical proofs requires repeated guided practice, but undergraduate students often lack access to on-demand tutoring in a judgment-free environment. In this work, we highlight the need for guided practice tools in undergraduate mathematics education and outline the desiderata of an effective practice tool. We accordingly develop LogicLearner, a web application for guided logic proof practice. LogicLearner consists of an interface to attempt logic proofs step-by-step and an automated proof solver to generate solutions on the fly, allowing users to request guidance as needed. We pilot LogicLearner as a practice tool in two semesters of an undergraduate discrete mathematics course and receive strongly positive feedback for usability and pedagogical value in student surveys. To the best of our knowledge, LogicLearner is the only learning tool that provides an end-to-end practice environment for logic proofs with immediate, judgment-free feedback.

# Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation: Enhancing Pixel-Level Understanding with Large Language Models for Advanced Vision Applications 

**Authors**: Ben Rahman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19276)  

**Abstract**: Semantic segmentation has made significant strides in pixel-level image understanding, yet it remains limited in capturing contextual and semantic relationships between objects. Current models, such as CNN and Transformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but fail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., "doctor" vs. "nurse" in a hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g., differentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous driving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are employed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies that are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual understanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language, paving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.

# NeoRL-2: Near Real-World Benchmarks for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Extended Realistic Scenarios 

**Authors**: Songyi Gao, Zuolin Tu, Rong-Jun Qin, Yi-Hao Sun, Xiong-Hui Chen, Yang Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19267)  

**Abstract**: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn from historical data without requiring (costly) access to the environment. To facilitate offline RL research, we previously introduced NeoRL, which highlighted that datasets from real-world tasks are often conservative and limited. With years of experience applying offline RL to various domains, we have identified additional real-world challenges. These include extremely conservative data distributions produced by deployed control systems, delayed action effects caused by high-latency transitions, external factors arising from the uncontrollable variance of transitions, and global safety constraints that are difficult to evaluate during the decision-making process. These challenges are underrepresented in previous benchmarks but frequently occur in real-world tasks. To address this, we constructed the extended Near Real-World Offline RL Benchmark (NeoRL-2), which consists of 7 datasets from 7 simulated tasks along with their corresponding evaluation simulators. Benchmarking results from state-of-the-art offline RL approaches demonstrate that current methods often struggle to outperform the data-collection behavior policy, highlighting the need for more effective methods. We hope NeoRL-2 will accelerate the development of reinforcement learning algorithms for real-world applications. The benchmark project page is available at this https URL.

# Linguistic Blind Spots of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Jiali Cheng, Hadi Amiri  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19260)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are the foundation of many AI applications today. However, despite their remarkable proficiency in generating coherent text, questions linger regarding their ability to perform fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks, such as detecting nouns or verbs, or identifying more complex syntactic structures like clauses in input texts. These tasks require precise syntactic and semantic understanding of input text, and when LLMs underperform on specific linguistic structures, it raises concerns about their reliability for detailed linguistic analysis and whether their (even correct) outputs truly reflect an understanding of the inputs. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of recent LLMs on fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks. Through a series of experiments, we find that recent LLMs show limited efficacy in addressing linguistic queries and often struggle with linguistically complex inputs. We show that the most capable LLM (Llama3-70b) makes notable errors in detecting linguistic structures, such as misidentifying embedded clauses, failing to recognize verb phrases, and confusing complex nominals with clauses. Our results provide insights to inform future advancements in LLM design and development.

**Authors**: Najeebullah, Maaz Salman, Zar Nawab Khan Swati  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19223)  

**Abstract**: Digital image spoofing has emerged as a significant security threat in biometric authentication systems, particularly those relying on facial recognition. This study evaluates the performance of three vision based models, MobileNetV2, ResNET50, and Vision Transformer, ViT, for spoof detection in image classification, utilizing a dataset of 150,986 images divided into training , 140,002, testing, 10,984, and validation ,39,574, sets. Spoof detection is critical for enhancing the security of image recognition systems, and this research compares the models effectiveness through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Results reveal that MobileNetV2 outperforms other architectures on the test dataset, achieving an accuracy of 91.59%, precision of 91.72%, recall of 91.59%, and F1 score of 91.58%, compared to ViT 86.54%, 88.28%, 86.54%, and 86.39%, respectively. On the validation dataset, MobileNetV2, and ViT excel, with MobileNetV2 slightly ahead at 97.17% accuracy versus ViT 96.36%. MobileNetV2 demonstrates faster convergence during training and superior generalization to unseen data, despite both models showing signs of overfitting. These findings highlight MobileNetV2 balanced performance and robustness, making it the preferred choice for spoof detection applications where reliability on new data is essential. The study underscores the importance of model selection in security sensitive contexts and suggests MobileNetV2 as a practical solution for real world deployment.

# LLM Benchmarking with LLaMA2: Evaluating Code Development Performance Across Multiple Programming Languages 

**Authors**: Patrick Diehl, Nojoud Nader, Maxim Moraru, Steven R. Brandt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19217)  

**Abstract**: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for automating various tasks in software development. This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.

**Authors**: Murong Yue  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19213)  

**Abstract**: This paper surveys the development of large language model (LLM)-based agents for question answering (QA). Traditional agents face significant limitations, including substantial data requirements and difficulty in generalizing to new environments. LLM-based agents address these challenges by leveraging LLMs as their core reasoning engine. These agents achieve superior QA results compared to traditional QA pipelines and naive LLM QA systems by enabling interaction with external environments. We systematically review the design of LLM agents in the context of QA tasks, organizing our discussion across key stages: planning, question understanding, information retrieval, and answer generation. Additionally, this paper identifies ongoing challenges and explores future research directions to enhance the performance of LLM agent QA systems.

# Continual Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Systems Control: Integrating Hypernetworks and Transfer Learning 

**Authors**: Gautham Udayakumar Bekal, Ahmed Ghareeb, Ashish Pujari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19212)  

**Abstract**: Buildings with Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems play a crucial role in ensuring indoor comfort and efficiency. While traditionally governed by physics-based models, the emergence of big data has enabled data-driven methods like Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). However, Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based techniques often suffer from sample inefficiency and limited generalization, especially across varying HVAC systems. We introduce a model-based reinforcement learning framework that uses a Hypernetwork to continuously learn environment dynamics across tasks with different action spaces. This enables efficient synthetic rollout generation and improved sample usage. Our approach demonstrates strong backward transfer in a continual learning setting after training on a second task, minimal fine-tuning on the first task allows rapid convergence within just 5 episodes and thus outperforming Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL) and effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. These findings have significant implications for reducing energy consumption and operational costs in building management, thus supporting global sustainability goals.

# Overtrained Language Models Are Harder to Fine-Tune 

**Authors**: Jacob Mitchell Springer, Sachin Goyal, Kaiyue Wen, Tanishq Kumar, Xiang Yue, Sadhika Malladi, Graham Neubig, Aditi Raghunathan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19206)  

**Abstract**: Large language models are pre-trained on ever-growing token budgets under the assumption that better pre-training performance translates to improved downstream models. In this work, we challenge this assumption and show that extended pre-training can make models harder to fine-tune, leading to degraded final performance. We term this phenomenon catastrophic overtraining. For example, the instruction-tuned OLMo-1B model pre-trained on 3T tokens leads to over 2% worse performance on multiple standard LLM benchmarks than its 2.3T token counterpart. Through controlled experiments and theoretical analysis, we show that catastrophic overtraining arises from a systematic increase in the broad sensitivity of pre-trained parameters to modifications, including but not limited to fine-tuning. Our findings call for a critical reassessment of pre-training design that considers the downstream adaptability of the model.

# A Shared Low-Rank Adaptation Approach to Personalized RLHF 

**Authors**: Renpu Liu, Peng Wang, Donghao Li, Cong Shen, Jing Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19201)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for aligning artificial intelligence systems with human values, achieving remarkable success in fine-tuning large language models. However, existing RLHF frameworks often assume that human preferences are relatively homogeneous and can be captured by a single, unified reward model. This assumption overlooks the inherent diversity and heterogeneity across individuals, limiting the adaptability of RLHF to personalized scenarios and risking misalignments that can diminish user satisfaction and trust in AI systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the personalized RLHF framework. We apply LoRA in the the aggregated parameter space of all personalized reward functions, thereby enabling efficient learning of personalized reward models from potentially limited local datasets. Our approach exploits potential shared structures among the local ground-truth reward models while allowing for individual adaptation, without relying on restrictive assumptions about shared representations as in prior works. We further establish sample complexity guarantees for our method. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in capturing both shared and individual-specific structures within heterogeneous human preferences, addressing the dual challenge of personalization requirements and practical data constraints. Experimental results on real-world datasets corroborate the efficiency of our algorithm in the personalized RLHF setting.

# SoK: How Robust is Audio Watermarking in Generative AI models? 

**Authors**: Yizhu Wen, Ashwin Innuganti, Aaron Bien Ramos, Hanqing Guo, Qiben Yan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19176)  

**Abstract**: Audio watermarking is increasingly used to verify the provenance of AI-generated content, enabling applications such as detecting AI-generated speech, protecting music IP, and defending against voice cloning. To be effective, audio watermarks must resist removal attacks that distort signals to evade detection. While many schemes claim robustness, these claims are typically tested in isolation and against a limited set of attacks. A systematic evaluation against diverse removal attacks is lacking, hindering practical deployment. In this paper, we investigate whether recent watermarking schemes that claim robustness can withstand a broad range of removal attacks. First, we introduce a taxonomy covering 22 audio watermarking schemes. Next, we summarize their underlying technologies and potential vulnerabilities. We then present a large-scale empirical study to assess their robustness. To support this, we build an evaluation framework encompassing 22 types of removal attacks (109 configurations) including signal-level, physical-level, and AI-induced distortions. We reproduce 9 watermarking schemes using open-source code, identify 8 new highly effective attacks, and highlight 11 key findings that expose the fundamental limitations of these methods across 3 public datasets. Our results reveal that none of the surveyed schemes can withstand all tested distortions. This evaluation offers a comprehensive view of how current watermarking methods perform under real-world threats. Our demo and code are available at this https URL.

# PSO-UNet: Particle Swarm-Optimized U-Net Framework for Precise Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation 

**Authors**: Shoffan Saifullah, Rafał Dreżewski  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19152)  

**Abstract**: Medical image segmentation, particularly for brain tumor analysis, demands precise and computationally efficient models due to the complexity of multimodal MRI datasets and diverse tumor morphologies. This study introduces PSO-UNet, which integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the U-Net architecture for dynamic hyperparameter optimization. Unlike traditional manual tuning or alternative optimization approaches, PSO effectively navigates complex hyperparameter search spaces, explicitly optimizing the number of filters, kernel size, and learning rate. PSO-UNet substantially enhances segmentation performance, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 0.9578 and 0.9523 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 0.9194 and 0.9097 on the BraTS 2021 and Figshare datasets, respectively. Moreover, the method reduces computational complexity significantly, utilizing only 7.8 million parameters and executing in approximately 906 seconds, markedly faster than comparable U-Net-based frameworks. These outcomes underscore PSO-UNet's robust generalization capabilities across diverse MRI modalities and tumor classifications, emphasizing its clinical potential and clear advantages over conventional hyperparameter tuning methods. Future research will explore hybrid optimization strategies and validate the framework against other bio-inspired algorithms to enhance its robustness and scalability.

# Overcoming Vocabulary Mismatch: Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling 

**Authors**: Haebin Shin, Lei Ji, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19123)  

**Abstract**: Using large teacher models to guide the training of smaller student models has become the prevailing paradigm for efficient and effective learning. However, vocabulary mismatches between teacher and student language models pose significant challenges in language modeling, resulting in divergent token sequences and output distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Vocabulary-agnostic Teacher Guided Language Modeling (VocAgnoLM), a novel approach that bridges the gap caused by vocabulary mismatch through two key methods: (1) Token-level Lexical Alignment, which aligns token sequences across mismatched vocabularies, and (2) Teacher Guided Loss, which leverages the loss of teacher model to guide effective student training. We demonstrate its effectiveness in language modeling with 1B student model using various 7B teacher models with different vocabularies. Notably, with Qwen2.5-Math-Instruct, a teacher model sharing only about 6% of its vocabulary with TinyLlama, VocAgnoLM achieves a 46% performance improvement compared to naive continual pretraining. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VocAgnoLM consistently benefits from stronger teacher models, providing a robust solution to vocabulary mismatches in language modeling.

# Where is this coming from? Making groundedness count in the evaluation of Document VQA models 

**Authors**: Armineh Nourbakhsh, Siddharth Parekh, Pranav Shetty, Zhao Jin, Sameena Shah, Carolyn Rose  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19120)  

**Abstract**: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have evolved at an impressive rate over the past few years, coming close to or matching human performance on some benchmarks. We argue that common evaluation metrics used by popular benchmarks do not account for the semantic and multimodal groundedness of a model's outputs. As a result, hallucinations and major semantic errors are treated the same way as well-grounded outputs, and the evaluation scores do not reflect the reasoning capabilities of the model. In response, we propose a new evaluation methodology that accounts for the groundedness of predictions with regard to the semantic characteristics of the output as well as the multimodal placement of the output within the input document. Our proposed methodology is parameterized in such a way that users can configure the score according to their preferences. We validate our scoring methodology using human judgment and show its potential impact on existing popular leaderboards. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate that our proposed method produces scores that are a better indicator of a model's robustness and tends to give higher rewards to better-calibrated answers.

**Authors**: Md. Barkat Ullah Tusher, Shartaz Khan Akash, Amirul Islam Showmik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19100)  

**Abstract**: This paper showcases an experimental study on anomaly detection using computer vision. The study focuses on class distinction and performance evaluation, combining OpenCV with deep learning techniques while employing a TensorFlow-based convolutional neural network for real-time face recognition and classification. The system effectively distinguishes among three classes: authorized personnel (admin), intruders, and non-human entities. A MobileNetV2-based deep learning model is utilized to optimize real-time performance, ensuring high computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Extensive dataset preprocessing, including image augmentation and normalization, enhances the models generalization capabilities. Our analysis demonstrates classification accuracies of 90.20% for admin, 98.60% for intruders, and 75.80% for non-human detection, while maintaining an average processing rate of 30 frames per second. The study leverages transfer learning, batch normalization, and Adam optimization to achieve stable and robust learning, and a comparative analysis of class differentiation strategies highlights the impact of feature extraction techniques and training methodologies. The results indicate that advanced feature selection and data augmentation significantly enhance detection performance, particularly in distinguishing human from non-human scenes. As an experimental study, this research provides critical insights into optimizing deep learning-based surveillance systems for high-security environments and improving the accuracy and efficiency of real-time anomaly detection.

# Rankers, Judges, and Assistants: Towards Understanding the Interplay of LLMs in Information Retrieval Evaluation 

**Authors**: Krisztian Balog, Donald Metzler, Zhen Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19092)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral to information retrieval (IR), powering ranking, evaluation, and AI-assisted content creation. This widespread adoption necessitates a critical examination of potential biases arising from the interplay between these LLM-based components. This paper synthesizes existing research and presents novel experiment designs that explore how LLM-based rankers and assistants influence LLM-based judges. We provide the first empirical evidence of LLM judges exhibiting significant bias towards LLM-based rankers. Furthermore, we observe limitations in LLM judges' ability to discern subtle system performance differences. Contrary to some previous findings, our preliminary study does not find evidence of bias against AI-generated content. These results highlight the need for a more holistic view of the LLM-driven information ecosystem. To this end, we offer initial guidelines and a research agenda to ensure the reliable use of LLMs in IR evaluation.

# The Case for "Thick Evaluations" of Cultural Representation in AI 

**Authors**: Rida Qadri, Mark Diaz, Ding Wang, Michael Madaio  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19075)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI image models have been increasingly evaluated for their (in)ability to represent non-Western cultures. We argue that these evaluations operate through reductive ideals of representation, abstracted from how people define their own representation and neglecting the inherently interpretive and contextual nature of cultural representation. In contrast to these 'thin' evaluations, we introduce the idea of 'thick evaluations': a more granular, situated, and discursive measurement framework for evaluating representations of social worlds in AI images, steeped in communities' own understandings of representation. We develop this evaluation framework through workshops in South Asia, by studying the 'thick' ways in which people interpret and assign meaning to images of their own cultures. We introduce practices for thicker evaluations of representation that expand the understanding of representation underpinning AI evaluations and by co-constructing metrics with communities, bringing measurement in line with the experiences of communities on the ground.

# HingeRLC-GAN: Combating Mode Collapse with Hinge Loss and RLC Regularization 

**Authors**: Osman Goni, Himadri Saha Arka, Mithun Halder, Mir Moynuddin Ahmed Shibly, Swakkhar Shatabda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19074)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their capability for producing high-quality images. However, a significant challenge remains mode collapse, which occurs when the generator produces a limited number of data patterns that do not reflect the diversity of the training dataset. This study addresses this issue by proposing a number of architectural changes aimed at increasing the diversity and stability of GAN models. We start by improving the loss function with Wasserstein loss and Gradient Penalty to better capture the full range of data variations. We also investigate various network architectures and conclude that ResNet significantly contributes to increased diversity. Building on these findings, we introduce HingeRLC-GAN, a novel approach that combines RLC Regularization and the Hinge loss function. With a FID Score of 18 and a KID Score of 0.001, our approach outperforms existing methods by effectively balancing training stability and increased diversity.

# Graph-Level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Graph Neural Networks 

**Authors**: Jiazhu Dai, Yubing Lu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19070)  

**Abstract**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for graph-structured data but are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) in graph classification tasks, which determine if a graph was part of the training dataset, potentially causing data leakage. Existing MIAs rely on prediction probability vectors, but they become ineffective when only prediction labels are available. We propose a Graph-level Label-Only Membership Inference Attack (GLO-MIA), which is based on the intuition that the target model's predictions on training data are more stable than those on testing data. GLO-MIA generates a set of perturbed graphs for target graph by adding perturbations to its effective features and queries the target model with the perturbed graphs to get their prediction labels, which are then used to calculate robustness score of the target graph. Finally, by comparing the robustness score with a predefined threshold, the membership of the target graph can be inferred correctly with high probability. Our evaluation on three datasets and four GNN models shows that GLO-MIA achieves an attack accuracy of up to 0.825, outperforming baseline work by 8.5% and closely matching the performance of probability-based MIAs, even with only prediction labels.

# Minimum Volume Conformal Sets for Multivariate Regression 

**Authors**: Sacha Braun, Liviu Aolaritei, Michael I. Jordan, Francis Bach  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19068)  

**Abstract**: Conformal prediction provides a principled framework for constructing predictive sets with finite-sample validity. While much of the focus has been on univariate response variables, existing multivariate methods either impose rigid geometric assumptions or rely on flexible but computationally expensive approaches that do not explicitly optimize prediction set volume. We propose an optimization-driven framework based on a novel loss function that directly learns minimum-volume covering sets while ensuring valid coverage. This formulation naturally induces a new nonconformity score for conformal prediction, which adapts to the residual distribution and covariates. Our approach optimizes over prediction sets defined by arbitrary norm balls, including single and multi-norm formulations. Additionally, by jointly optimizing both the predictive model and predictive uncertainty, we obtain prediction sets that are tight, informative, and computationally efficient, as demonstrated in our experiments on real-world datasets.

# Mist: Efficient Distributed Training of Large Language Models via Memory-Parallelism Co-Optimization 

**Authors**: Zhanda Zhu, Christina Giannoula, Muralidhar Andoorveedu, Qidong Su, Karttikeya Mangalam, Bojian Zheng, Gennady Pekhimenko  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19050)  

**Abstract**: Various parallelism, such as data, tensor, and pipeline parallelism, along with memory optimizations like activation checkpointing, redundancy elimination, and offloading, have been proposed to accelerate distributed training for Large Language Models. To find the best combination of these techniques, automatic distributed training systems are proposed. However, existing systems only tune a subset of optimizations, due to the lack of overlap awareness, inability to navigate the vast search space, and ignoring the inter-microbatch imbalance, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Mist, a memory, overlap, and imbalance-aware automatic distributed training system that comprehensively co-optimizes all memory footprint reduction techniques alongside parallelism. Mist is based on three key ideas: (1) fine-grained overlap-centric scheduling, orchestrating optimizations in an overlapped manner, (2) symbolic-based performance analysis that predicts runtime and memory usage using symbolic expressions for fast tuning, and (3) imbalance-aware hierarchical tuning, decoupling the process into an inter-stage imbalance and overlap aware Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem and an intra-stage Dual-Objective Constrained Optimization problem, and connecting them through Pareto frontier sampling. Our evaluation results show that Mist achieves an average of 1.28$\times$ (up to 1.73$\times$) and 1.27$\times$ (up to 2.04$\times$) speedup compared to state-of-the-art manual system Megatron-LM and state-of-the-art automatic system Aceso, respectively.

# Forecasting Labor Demand: Predicting JOLT Job Openings using Deep Learning Model 

**Authors**: Kyungsu Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19048)  

**Abstract**: This thesis studies the effectiveness of Long Short Term Memory model in forecasting future Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data in the United States. Drawing on multiple economic indicators from various sources, the data are fed directly into LSTM model to predict JOLT job openings in subsequent periods. The performance of the LSTM model is compared with conventional autoregressive approaches, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Holt-Winters. Findings suggest that the LSTM model outperforms these traditional models in predicting JOLT job openings, as it not only captures the dependent variables trends but also harmonized with key economic factors. These results highlight the potential of deep learning techniques in capturing complex temporal dependencies in economic data, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in developing data-driven labor market strategies

# LookAhead Tuning: Safer Language Models via Partial Answer Previews 

**Authors**: Kangwei Liu, Mengru Wang, Yujie Luo, Lin Yuan, Mengshu Sun, Ningyu Zhang, Lei Liang, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou, Huajun Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19041)  

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often undermines their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, which comprises two simple, low-resource, and effective data-driven methods that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes. Both methods aim to preserve the model's inherent safety mechanisms by minimizing perturbations to initial token distributions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs. Code is released at this https URL.

# Evolutionary Policy Optimization 

**Authors**: Jianren Wang, Yifan Su, Abhinav Gupta, Deepak Pathak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19037)  

**Abstract**: Despite its extreme sample inefficiency, on-policy reinforcement learning has become a fundamental tool in real-world applications. With recent advances in GPU-driven simulation, the ability to collect vast amounts of data for RL training has scaled exponentially. However, studies show that current on-policy methods, such as PPO, fail to fully leverage the benefits of parallelized environments, leading to performance saturation beyond a certain scale. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) excel at increasing diversity through randomization, making them a natural complement to RL. However, existing EvoRL methods have struggled to gain widespread adoption due to their extreme sample inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a novel policy gradient algorithm that combines the strengths of EA and policy gradients. We show that EPO significantly improves performance across diverse and challenging environments, demonstrating superior scalability with parallelized simulations.

# Option Discovery Using LLM-guided Semantic Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Chak Lam Shek, Pratap Tokekar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19007)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise in reasoning and decision-making, yet their integration with Reinforcement Learning (RL) for complex robotic tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose an LLM-guided hierarchical RL framework, termed LDSC, that leverages LLM-driven subgoal selection and option reuse to enhance sample efficiency, generalization, and multi-task adaptability. Traditional RL methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and high computational cost. Hierarchical RL helps with these challenges, but existing methods often fail to reuse options effectively when faced with new tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a three-stage framework that uses LLMs for subgoal generation given natural language description of the task, a reusable option learning and selection method, and an action-level policy, enabling more effective decision-making across diverse tasks. By incorporating LLMs for subgoal prediction and policy guidance, our approach improves exploration efficiency and enhances learning performance. On average, LDSC outperforms the baseline by 55.9\% in average reward, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex RL settings.

# Computational Thinking with Computer Vision: Developing AI Competency in an Introductory Computer Science Course 

**Authors**: Tahiya Chowdhury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19006)  

**Abstract**: Developing competency in artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly crucial for computer science (CS) students at all levels of the CS curriculum. However, most previous research focuses on advanced CS courses, as traditional introductory courses provide limited opportunities to develop AI skills and knowledge. This paper introduces an introductory CS course where students learn computational thinking through computer vision, a sub-field of AI, as an application context. The course aims to achieve computational thinking outcomes alongside critical thinking outcomes that expose students to AI approaches and their societal implications.

# DisentTalk: Cross-lingual Talking Face Generation via Semantic Disentangled Diffusion Model 

**Authors**: Kangwei Liu, Junwu Liu, Yun Cao, Jinlin Guo, Xiaowei Yi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19001)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in talking face generation have significantly improved facial animation synthesis. However, existing approaches face fundamental limitations: 3DMM-based methods maintain temporal consistency but lack fine-grained regional control, while Stable Diffusion-based methods enable spatial manipulation but suffer from temporal inconsistencies. The integration of these approaches is hindered by incompatible control mechanisms and semantic entanglement of facial representations. This paper presents DisentTalk, introducing a data-driven semantic disentanglement framework that decomposes 3DMM expression parameters into meaningful subspaces for fine-grained facial control. Building upon this disentangled representation, we develop a hierarchical latent diffusion architecture that operates in 3DMM parameter space, integrating region-aware attention mechanisms to ensure both spatial precision and temporal coherence. To address the scarcity of high-quality Chinese training data, we introduce CHDTF, a Chinese high-definition talking face dataset. Extensive experiments show superior performance over existing methods across multiple metrics, including lip synchronization, expression quality, and temporal consistency.

# FACE: Few-shot Adapter with Cross-view Fusion for Cross-subject EEG Emotion Recognition 

**Authors**: Haiqi Liu, C. L. Philip Chen, Tong Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18998)  

**Abstract**: Cross-subject EEG emotion recognition is challenged by significant inter-subject variability and intricately entangled intra-subject variability. Existing works have primarily addressed these challenges through domain adaptation or generalization strategies. However, they typically require extensive target subject data or demonstrate limited generalization performance to unseen subjects. Recent few-shot learning paradigms attempt to address these limitations but often encounter catastrophic overfitting during subject-specific adaptation with limited samples. This article introduces the few-shot adapter with a cross-view fusion method called FACE for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition, which leverages dynamic multi-view fusion and effective subject-specific adaptation. Specifically, FACE incorporates a cross-view fusion module that dynamically integrates global brain connectivity with localized patterns via subject-specific fusion weights to provide complementary emotional information. Moreover, the few-shot adapter module is proposed to enable rapid adaptation for unseen subjects while reducing overfitting by enhancing adapter structures with meta-learning. Experimental results on three public EEG emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate FACE's superior generalization performance over state-of-the-art methods. FACE provides a practical solution for cross-subject scenarios with limited labeled data.

# Enhanced prediction of spine surgery outcomes using advanced machine learning techniques and oversampling methods 

**Authors**: José Alberto Benítez-Andrades, Camino Prada-García, Nicolás Ordás-Reyes, Marta Esteban Blanco, Alicia Merayo, Antonio Serrano-García  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18996)  

**Abstract**: The study proposes an advanced machine learning approach to predict spine surgery outcomes by incorporating oversampling techniques and grid search optimization. A variety of models including GaussianNB, ComplementNB, KNN, Decision Tree, and optimized versions with RandomOverSampler and SMOTE were tested on a dataset of 244 patients, which included pre-surgical, psychometric, socioeconomic, and analytical variables. The enhanced KNN models achieved up to 76% accuracy and a 67% F1-score, while grid-search optimization further improved performance. The findings underscore the potential of these advanced techniques to aid healthcare professionals in decision-making, with future research needed to refine these models on larger and more diverse datasets.

# LLMs in the Classroom: Outcomes and Perceptions of Questions Written with the Aid of AI 

**Authors**: Gavin Witsken, Igor Crk, Eren Gultepe  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18995)  

**Abstract**: We randomly deploy questions constructed with and without use of the LLM tool and gauge the ability of the students to correctly answer, as well as their ability to correctly perceive the difference between human-authored and LLM-authored questions. In determining whether the questions written with the aid of ChatGPT were consistent with the instructor's questions and source text, we computed representative vectors of both the human and ChatGPT questions using SBERT and compared cosine similarity to the course textbook. A non-significant Mann-Whitney U test (z = 1.018, p = .309) suggests that students were unable to perceive whether questions were written with or without the aid of ChatGPT. However, student scores on LLM-authored questions were almost 9% lower (z = 2.702, p < .01). This result may indicate that either the AI questions were more difficult or that the students were more familiar with the instructor's style of questions. Overall, the study suggests that while there is potential for using LLM tools to aid in the construction of assessments, care must be taken to ensure that the questions are fair, well-composed, and relevant to the course material.

# HH4AI: A methodological Framework for AI Human Rights impact assessment under the EUAI ACT 

**Authors**: Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani, Maria Elisa D'Amico, Bianca de Teffe Erb, Simone Favaro, Nannerel Fiano, Paolo Gambatesa, Simone La Porta, Samira Maghool, Lara Mauri, Niccolo Panigada, Lorenzo Maria Ratto Vaquer, Marta A. Tamborini  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18994)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces the HH4AI Methodology, a structured approach to assessing the impact of AI systems on human rights, focusing on compliance with the EU AI Act and addressing technical, ethical, and regulatory challenges. The paper highlights AIs transformative nature, driven by autonomy, data, and goal-oriented design, and how the EU AI Act promotes transparency, accountability, and safety. A key challenge is defining and assessing "high-risk" AI systems across industries, complicated by the lack of universally accepted standards and AIs rapid evolution.
To address these challenges, the paper explores the relevance of ISO/IEC and IEEE standards, focusing on risk management, data quality, bias mitigation, and governance. It proposes a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) methodology, a gate-based framework designed to isolate and assess risks through phases including an AI system overview, a human rights checklist, an impact assessment, and a final output phase. A filtering mechanism tailors the assessment to the system's characteristics, targeting areas like accountability, AI literacy, data governance, and transparency.
The paper illustrates the FRIA methodology through a fictional case study of an automated healthcare triage service. The structured approach enables systematic filtering, comprehensive risk assessment, and mitigation planning, effectively prioritizing critical risks and providing clear remediation strategies. This promotes better alignment with human rights principles and enhances regulatory compliance.

# SRMIR: Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning for LLM Alignment 

**Authors**: Ruoxi Cheng, Shuirong Cao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18991)  

**Abstract**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences and values is vital for application. However, current alignment methods face three main limitations: (1) reliance on costly human annotation; (2) alignment tax; (3) shallow alignment vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Additionally, current alignment datasets often suffer from uneven distributions, leading to overrepresentation of some topics and neglect of others. To address these issues, we propose SRMIR (Shadow Reward Models Based on Introspective Reasoning), inspired by shadow models in membership inference attacks. We first construct a balanced safety Chain of Draft (CoD) dataset across $7$ harmful types with structured prompt leveraging the introspective reasoning capabilities of LLMs, then train a set of specialized reward models to guide policy optimization through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We apply two strategies, linear combination and categorized approach, to integrate shadow reward models for policy optimization. By comparison, we find that the latter achieves superior alignment despite higher computational costs. Experiments across several LLMs demonstrate SRMIR significantly outperforms existing methods.

# SG-Tailor: Inter-Object Commonsense Relationship Reasoning for Scene Graph Manipulation 

**Authors**: Haoliang Shang, Hanyu Wu, Guangyao Zhai, Boyang Sun, Fangjinhua Wang, Federico Tombari, Marc Pollefeys  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18988)  

**Abstract**: Scene graphs capture complex relationships among objects, serving as strong priors for content generation and manipulation. Yet, reasonably manipulating scene graphs -- whether by adding nodes or modifying edges -- remains a challenging and untouched task. Tasks such as adding a node to the graph or reasoning about a node's relationships with all others are computationally intractable, as even a single edge modification can trigger conflicts due to the intricate interdependencies within the graph. To address these challenges, we introduce SG-Tailor, an autoregressive model that predicts the conflict-free relationship between any two nodes. SG-Tailor not only infers inter-object relationships, including generating commonsense edges for newly added nodes but also resolves conflicts arising from edge modifications to produce coherent, manipulated graphs for downstream tasks. For node addition, the model queries the target node and other nodes from the graph to predict the appropriate relationships. For edge modification, SG-Tailor employs a Cut-And-Stitch strategy to solve the conflicts and globally adjust the graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SG-Tailor outperforms competing methods by a large margin and can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-in module for scene generation and robotic manipulation tasks.

# Balanced Direction from Multifarious Choices: Arithmetic Meta-Learning for Domain Generalization 

**Authors**: Xiran Wang, Jian Zhang, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18987)  

**Abstract**: Domain generalization is proposed to address distribution shift, arising from statistical disparities between training source and unseen target domains. The widely used first-order meta-learning algorithms demonstrate strong performance for domain generalization by leveraging the gradient matching theory, which aims to establish balanced parameters across source domains to reduce overfitting to any particular domain. However, our analysis reveals that there are actually numerous directions to achieve gradient matching, with current methods representing just one possible path. These methods actually overlook another critical factor that the balanced parameters should be close to the centroid of optimal parameters of each source domain. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective arithmetic meta-learning with arithmetic-weighted gradients. This approach, while adhering to the principles of gradient matching, promotes a more precise balance by estimating the centroid between domain-specific optimal parameters. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our strategy.

# SplitFrozen: Split Learning with Device-side Model Frozen for Fine-Tuning LLM on Heterogeneous Resource-Constrained Devices 

**Authors**: Jian Ma, Xinchen Lyu, Jun Jiang, Qimei Cui, Haipeng Yao, Xiaofeng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18986)  

**Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on private, on-device data can empower tailored personalized AI agents. However, fine-tuning LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices faces significant challenges, including excessive computation overhead, device heterogeneity, and data imbalance. This paper proposes SplitFrozen, a split learning framework that enables efficient LLM fine-tuning by strategically freezing device-side model layers while centralizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the server. Our framework partitions LLMs into device-side frozen layers and server-side fine-tuning layers, where heterogeneous resource-constrained devices execute only forward propagation. To minimize server-side training costs, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the server-side layers. A pipeline parallelism strategy further optimizes training efficiency by decoupling device-server computations and leveraging decomposed backward propagation. Experiments on GPT-2 with the MRPC, MNLI-matched, and SST-2 datasets demonstrate that SplitFrozen outperforms FedLoRA and SplitLoRA by 69.4\% model accuracy under extremely imbalanced data, while reducing up to 86.8\% device-side computations and 50.2\% total training time. Experiments also validate the scalability of SplitFrozen on content generation task using Llama-3.2 model on GSM8K dataset.

# LoRA Subtraction for Drift-Resistant Space in Exemplar-Free Continual Learning 

**Authors**: Xuan Liu, Xiaobin Chang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18985)  

**Abstract**: In continual learning (CL), catastrophic forgetting often arises due to feature drift. This challenge is particularly prominent in the exemplar-free continual learning (EFCL) setting, where samples from previous tasks cannot be retained, making it difficult to preserve prior knowledge. To address this issue, some EFCL methods aim to identify feature spaces that minimize the impact on previous tasks while accommodating new ones. However, they rely on static features or outdated statistics stored from old tasks, which prevents them from capturing the dynamic evolution of the feature space in CL, leading to performance degradation over time. In this paper, we introduce the Drift-Resistant Space (DRS), which effectively handles feature drifts without requiring explicit feature modeling or the storage of previous tasks. A novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach called Low-Rank Adaptation Subtraction (LoRA-) is proposed to develop the DRS. This method subtracts the LoRA weights of old tasks from the initial pre-trained weight before processing new task data to establish the DRS for model training. Therefore, LoRA- enhances stability, improves efficiency, and simplifies implementation. Furthermore, stabilizing feature drifts allows for better plasticity by learning with a triplet loss. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art results, especially for long task sequences, across multiple datasets.

# Confronting Catastrophic Risk: The International Obligation to Regulate Artificial Intelligence 

**Authors**: Bryan Druzin, Anatole Boute, Michael Ramsden  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18983)  

**Abstract**: While artificial intelligence (AI) holds enormous promise, many experts in the field are warning that there is a non-trivial chance that the development of AI poses an existential threat to humanity. Existing regulatory initiative do not address this threat but merely instead focus on discrete AI-related risks such as consumer safety, cybersecurity, data protection, and privacy. In the absence of regulatory action to address the possible risk of human extinction by AI, the question arises: What legal obligations, if any, does public international law impose on states to regulate its development. Grounded in the precautionary principle, we argue that there exists an international obligation to mitigate the threat of human extinction by AI. Often invoked in relation to environmental regulation and the regulation of potentially harmful technologies, the principle holds that in situations where there is the potential for significant harm, even in the absence of full scientific certainty, preventive measures should not be postponed if delayed action may result in irreversible consequences. We argue that the precautionary principle is a general principle of international law and, therefore, that there is a positive obligation on states under the right to life within international human rights law to proactively take regulatory action to mitigate the potential existential risk of AI. This is significant because, if an international obligation to regulate the development of AI can be established under international law, then the basic legal framework would be in place to address this evolving threat.

# Generative Data Imputation for Sparse Learner Performance Data Using Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks 

**Authors**: Liang Zhang, Jionghao Lin, John Sabatini, Diego Zapata-Rivera, Carol Forsyth, Yang Jiang, John Hollander, Xiangen Hu, Arthur C. Graesser  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18982)  

**Abstract**: Learner performance data collected by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), such as responses to questions, is essential for modeling and predicting learners' knowledge states. However, missing responses due to skips or incomplete attempts create data sparsity, challenging accurate assessment and personalized instruction. To address this, we propose a generative imputation approach using Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN). Our method features a three-dimensional (3D) framework (learners, questions, and attempts), flexibly accommodating various sparsity levels. Enhanced by convolutional neural networks and optimized with a least squares loss function, the GAIN-based method aligns input and output dimensions to question-attempt matrices along the learners' dimension. Extensive experiments using datasets from AutoTutor Adult Reading Comprehension (ARC), ASSISTments, and MATHia demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms tensor factorization and alternative GAN methods in imputation accuracy across different attempt scenarios. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) further validates the effectiveness of the imputed data by estimating learning parameters: initial knowledge (P(L0)), learning rate (P(T)), guess rate (P(G)), and slip rate (P(S)). Results indicate the imputed data enhances model fit and closely mirrors original distributions, capturing underlying learning behaviors reliably. Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence assessments confirm minimal divergence, showing the imputed data preserves essential learning characteristics effectively. These findings underscore GAIN's capability as a robust imputation tool in ITSs, alleviating data sparsity and supporting adaptive, individualized instruction, ultimately leading to more precise and responsive learner assessments and improved educational outcomes.

# FedSKD: Aggregation-free Model-heterogeneous Federated Learning using Multi-dimensional Similarity Knowledge Distillation 

**Authors**: Ziqiao Weng, Weidong Cai, Bo Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18981)  

**Abstract**: Federated learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training without direct data sharing. Model-heterogeneous FL (MHFL) extends this paradigm by allowing clients to train personalized models with heterogeneous architectures tailored to their computational resources and application-specific needs. However, existing MHFL methods predominantly rely on centralized aggregation, which introduces scalability and efficiency bottlenecks, or impose restrictions requiring partially identical model architectures across clients. While peer-to-peer (P2P) FL removes server dependence, it suffers from model drift and knowledge dilution, limiting its effectiveness in heterogeneous settings. To address these challenges, we propose FedSKD, a novel MHFL framework that facilitates direct knowledge exchange through round-robin model circulation, eliminating the need for centralized aggregation while allowing fully heterogeneous model architectures across clients. FedSKD's key innovation lies in multi-dimensional similarity knowledge distillation, which enables bidirectional cross-client knowledge transfer at batch, pixel/voxel, and region levels for heterogeneous models in FL. This approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and model drift through progressive reinforcement and distribution alignment while preserving model heterogeneity. Extensive evaluations on fMRI-based autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and skin lesion classification demonstrate that FedSKD outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous and homogeneous FL baselines, achieving superior personalization (client-specific accuracy) and generalization (cross-institutional adaptability). These findings underscore FedSKD's potential as a scalable and robust solution for real-world medical federated learning applications.

# CAE: Repurposing the Critic as an Explorer in Deep Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Yexin Li, Pring Wong, Hanfang Zhang, Shuo Chen, Siyuan Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18980)  

**Abstract**: Exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning, as many existing methods either lack theoretical guarantees or fall short of practical effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce CAE, a lightweight algorithm that repurposes the value networks in standard deep RL algorithms to drive exploration without introducing additional parameters. CAE utilizes any linear multi-armed bandit technique and incorporates an appropriate scaling strategy, enabling efficient exploration with provable sub-linear regret bounds and practical stability. Notably, it is simple to implement, requiring only around 10 lines of code. In complex tasks where learning an effective value network proves challenging, we propose CAE+, an extension of CAE that incorporates an auxiliary network. This extension increases the parameter count by less than 1% while maintaining implementation simplicity, adding only about 10 additional lines of code. Experiments on MuJoCo and MiniHack show that both CAE and CAE+ outperform state-of-the-art baselines, bridging the gap between theoretical rigor and practical efficiency.

# Threshold Crossings as Tail Events for Catastrophic AI Risk 

**Authors**: Elija Perrier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18979)  

**Abstract**: We analyse circumstances in which bifurcation-driven jumps in AI systems with their emergent heavy-tailed outcome distributions. By analysing how a control parameter's random fluctuations near a catastrophic threshold generate extreme outcomes, we demonstrate in what circumstances the probability of a sudden, large-scale, transition aligns closely with the tail probability of the resulting damage distribution. Our results contribute to research in monitoring, mitigation and control of AI systems when seeking to manage potentially catastrophic AI risk.

# Synthetic media and computational capitalism: towards a critical theory of artificial intelligence 

**Authors**: David M. Berry  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18976)  

**Abstract**: This paper develops a critical theory of artificial intelligence, within a historical constellation where computational systems increasingly generate cultural content that destabilises traditional distinctions between human and machine production. Through this analysis, I introduce the concept of the algorithmic condition, a cultural moment when machine-generated work not only becomes indistinguishable from human creation but actively reshapes our understanding of ideas of authenticity. This transformation, I argue, moves beyond false consciousness towards what I call post-consciousness, where the boundaries between individual and synthetic consciousness become porous. Drawing on critical theory and extending recent work on computational ideology, I develop three key theoretical contributions, first, the concept of the Inversion to describe a new computational turn in algorithmic society; second, automimetric production as a framework for understanding emerging practices of automated value creation; and third, constellational analysis as a methodological approach for mapping the complex interplay of technical systems, cultural forms and political economic structures. Through these contributions, I argue that we need new critical methods capable of addressing both the technical specificity of AI systems and their role in restructuring forms of life under computational capitalism. The paper concludes by suggesting that critical reflexivity is needed to engage with the algorithmic condition without being subsumed by it and that it represents a growing challenge for contemporary critical theory.

**Authors**: Dilshod Nematov, Mirabbos Hojamberdiev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18975)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

**Authors**: Muhammad Ahmad, Sardar Usman, Ildar Batyrshin, Muhammad Muzammil, K. Sajid, M. Hasnain, Muhammad Jalal, Grigori Sidorov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18973)  

**Abstract**: Background: Lung disease is a significant health issue, particularly in children and elderly individuals. It often results from lung infections and is one of the leading causes of mortality in children. Globally, lung-related diseases claim many lives each year, making early and accurate diagnoses crucial. Radiographs are valuable tools for the diagnosis of such conditions. The most prevalent lung diseases, including pneumonia, asthma, allergies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer, represent significant public health challenges. Early prediction of these conditions is critical, as it allows for the identification of risk factors and implementation of preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of disease onset
Methods: In this study, we utilized a dataset comprising 3,475 chest X-ray images sourced from from Mendeley Data provided by Talukder, M. A. (2023) [14], categorized into three classes: normal, lung opacity, and pneumonia. We applied five pre-trained deep learning models, including CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet, CheXNet, and U-Net, as well as two transfer learning algorithms such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and Shifted Window (Swin) to classify these images. This approach aims to address diagnostic issues in lung abnormalities by reducing reliance on human intervention through automated classification systems. Our analysis was conducted in both binary and multiclass settings. Results: In the binary classification, we focused on distinguishing between normal and viral pneumonia cases, whereas in the multi-class classification, all three classes (normal, lung opacity, and viral pneumonia) were included. Our proposed methodology (ViT) achieved remarkable performance, with accuracy rates of 99% for binary classification and 95.25% for multiclass classification.

# Unifying EEG and Speech for Emotion Recognition: A Two-Step Joint Learning Framework for Handling Missing EEG Data During Inference 

**Authors**: Upasana Tiwari, Rupayan Chakraborty, Sunil Kumar Kopparapu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18964)  

**Abstract**: Computer interfaces are advancing towards using multi-modalities to enable better human-computer interactions. The use of automatic emotion recognition (AER) can make the interactions natural and meaningful thereby enhancing the user experience. Though speech is the most direct and intuitive modality for AER, it is not reliable because it can be intentionally faked by humans. On the other hand, physiological modalities like EEG, are more reliable and impossible to fake. However, use of EEG is infeasible for realistic scenarios usage because of the need for specialized recording setup. In this paper, one of our primary aims is to ride on the reliability of the EEG modality to facilitate robust AER on the speech modality. Our approach uses both the modalities during training to reliably identify emotion at the time of inference, even in the absence of the more reliable EEG modality. We propose, a two-step joint multi-modal learning approach (JMML) that exploits both the intra- and inter- modal characteristics to construct emotion embeddings that enrich the performance of AER. In the first step, using JEC-SSL, intra-modal learning is done independently on the individual modalities. This is followed by an inter-modal learning using the proposed extended variant of deep canonically correlated cross-modal autoencoder (E-DCC-CAE). The approach learns the joint properties of both the modalities by mapping them into a common representation space, such that the modalities are maximally correlated. These emotion embeddings, hold properties of both the modalities there by enhancing the performance of ML classifier used for AER. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed approach. To best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine speech and EEG with joint multi-modal learning approach for reliable AER.

# International Agreements on AI Safety: Review and Recommendations for a Conditional AI Safety Treaty 

**Authors**: Rebecca Scholefield, Samuel Martin, Otto Barten  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18956)  

**Abstract**: The malicious use or malfunction of advanced general-purpose AI (GPAI) poses risks that, according to leading experts, could lead to the 'marginalisation or extinction of humanity.' To address these risks, there are an increasing number of proposals for international agreements on AI safety. In this paper, we review recent (2023-) proposals, identifying areas of consensus and disagreement, and drawing on related literature to assess their feasibility. We focus our discussion on risk thresholds, regulations, types of international agreement and five related processes: building scientific consensus, standardisation, auditing, verification and incentivisation.
Based on this review, we propose a treaty establishing a compute threshold above which development requires rigorous oversight. This treaty would mandate complementary audits of models, information security and governance practices, overseen by an international network of AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) with authority to pause development if risks are unacceptable. Our approach combines immediately implementable measures with a flexible structure that can adapt to ongoing research.

# On the Hopf-Cole Transform for Control-affine Schrödinger Bridge 

**Authors**: Alexis Teter, Abhishek Halder  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17640)  

**Abstract**: The purpose of this note is to clarify the importance of the relation $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto \boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$ in solving control-affine Schrödinger bridge problems via the Hopf-Cole transform, where $\boldsymbol{g},\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ are the control and noise coefficients, respectively. We show that the Hopf-Cole transform applied to the conditions of optimality for generic control-affine Schrödinger bridge problems, i.e., without the assumption $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto\boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$, gives a pair of forward-backward PDEs that are neither linear nor equation-level decoupled. We explain how the resulting PDEs can be interpreted as nonlinear forward-backward advection-diffusion-reaction equations, where the nonlinearity stem from additional drift and reaction terms involving the gradient of the log-likelihood a.k.a. the score. These additional drift and reaction vanish when $\boldsymbol{gg}^{\top}\propto\boldsymbol{\sigma\sigma}^{\top}$, and the resulting boundary-coupled system of linear PDEs can then be solved by dynamic Sinkhorn recursions. A key takeaway of our work is that the numerical solution of the generic control-affine Schrödinger bridge requires further algorithmic development, possibly generalizing the dynamic Sinkhorn recursion or otherwise.
