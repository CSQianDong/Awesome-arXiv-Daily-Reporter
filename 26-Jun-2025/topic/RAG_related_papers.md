**Abstract**: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2 emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation. Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy (58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.

**Abstract**: Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.

# Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering of LLMs, for the Creation of Multi-Agent AI for Addressing Sustainable Protein Production Challenges 

**Authors**: Alexander D. Kalian, Jaewook Lee, Stefan P. Johannesson, Lennart Otte, Christer Hogstrand, Miao Guo

**Abstract**: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities

# CCRS: A Zero-Shot LLM-as-a-Judge Framework for Comprehensive RAG Evaluation 

**Authors**: Aashiq Muhamed  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20128)  

**Abstract**: RAG systems enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, which is crucial for domains that demand factual accuracy and up-to-date information. However, evaluating the multifaceted quality of RAG outputs, spanning aspects such as contextual coherence, query relevance, factual correctness, and informational completeness, poses significant challenges. Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient. CCRS thus provides a practical, comprehensive, and efficient framework for evaluating and iteratively improving RAG systems.

# Inference Scaled GraphRAG: Improving Multi Hop Question Answering on Knowledge Graphs 

**Authors**: Travis Thompson, Seung-Hwan Lim, Paul Liu, Ruoying He, Dongkuan Xu

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive capabilities in language understanding and generation, yet they continue to underperform on knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks due to limited access to structured context and multi-hop information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially mitigates this by grounding generation in retrieved context, but conventional RAG and GraphRAG methods often fail to capture relational structure across nodes in knowledge graphs. We introduce Inference-Scaled GraphRAG, a novel framework that enhances LLM-based graph reasoning by applying inference-time compute scaling. Our method combines sequential scaling with deep chain-of-thought graph traversal, and parallel scaling with majority voting over sampled trajectories within an interleaved reasoning-execution loop. Experiments on the GRBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly improves multi-hop question answering performance, achieving substantial gains over both traditional GraphRAG and prior graph traversal baselines. These findings suggest that inference-time scaling is a practical and architecture-agnostic solution for structured knowledge reasoning with LLMs

# MMSearch-R1: Incentivizing LMMs to Search 

**Authors**: Jinming Wu, Zihao Deng, Wei Li, Yiding Liu, Bo You, Bo Li, Zejun Ma, Ziwei Liu

**Abstract**: Robust deployment of large multimodal models (LMMs) in real-world scenarios requires access to external knowledge sources, given the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world information. Existing approaches such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineered search agents rely on rigid pipelines, often leading to inefficient or excessive search behaviors. We present MMSearch-R1, the first end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables LMMs to perform on-demand, multi-turn search in real-world Internet environments. Our framework integrates both image and text search tools, allowing the model to reason about when and how to invoke them guided by an outcome-based reward with a search penalty. To support training, We collect a multimodal search VQA dataset through a semi-automated pipeline that covers diverse visual and textual knowledge needs and curate a search-balanced subset with both search-required and search-free samples, which proves essential for shaping efficient and on-demand search behavior. Extensive experiments on knowledge-intensive and info-seeking VQA tasks show that our model not only outperforms RAG-based baselines of the same model size, but also matches the performance of a larger RAG-based model while reducing search calls by over 30%. We further analyze key empirical findings to offer actionable insights for advancing research in multimodal search.

# Controlled Retrieval-augmented Context Evaluation for Long-form RAG 

**Authors**: Jia-Huei Ju, Suzan Verberne, Maarten de Rijke, Andrew Yates  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20051)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating context retrieved from external knowledge sources. While the effectiveness of the retrieval module is typically evaluated with relevance-based ranking metrics, such metrics may be insufficient to reflect the retrieval's impact on the final RAG result, especially in long-form generation scenarios. We argue that providing a comprehensive retrieval-augmented context is important for long-form RAG tasks like report generation and propose metrics for assessing the context independent of generation. We introduce CRUX, a \textbf{C}ontrolled \textbf{R}etrieval-a\textbf{U}gmented conte\textbf{X}t evaluation framework designed to directly assess retrieval-augmented contexts. This framework uses human-written summaries to control the information scope of knowledge, enabling us to measure how well the context covers information essential for long-form generation. CRUX uses question-based evaluation to assess RAG's retrieval in a fine-grained manner. Empirical results show that CRUX offers more reflective and diagnostic evaluation. Our findings also reveal substantial room for improvement in current retrieval methods, pointing to promising directions for advancing RAG's retrieval. Our data and code are publicly available to support and advance future research on retrieval.
