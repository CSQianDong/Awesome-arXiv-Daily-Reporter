However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology, we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.'}

Although recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed. Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively.

We use two different approaches for retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description. The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined.

To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model\'s weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an "evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations.'}

In addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains, like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages. Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages. We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different conclusions from our research. We additionally release the corrected dataset to the community."}

Automatic text simplification solutions, including advanced large language models, however, continue to face challenges in reliably arbitrating the tension between optimizing readability performance and ensuring preservation of discourse fidelity. This report empirically assesses the performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46), while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary domain-adaptation issue for simplification.'}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}

Yet, real-world applications of LLMs often take place within organizational ecosystems shaped by distinctive corporate policies, regulatory requirements, use cases, brand guidelines, and ethical commitments. This reality highlights the need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of LLMs with pluralistic alignment goals, an alignment paradigm that emphasizes adaptability to diverse user values and needs. In this work, we present PLURALISTIC BEHAVIOR SUITE (PBSUITE), a dynamic evaluation suite designed to systematically assess LLMs' capacity to adhere to pluralistic alignment specifications in multi-turn, interactive conversations. PBSUITE consists of (1) a diverse dataset of 300 realistic LLM behavioral policies, grounded in 30 industries; and (2) a dynamic evaluation framework for stress-testing model compliance with custom behavioral specifications under adversarial conditions. Using PBSUITE, We find that leading open- and closed-source LLMs maintain robust adherence to behavioral policies in single-turn settings (less than 4% failure rates), but their compliance weakens substantially in multi-turn adversarial interactions (up to 84% failure rates). These findings highlight that existing model alignment and safety moderation methods fall short in coherently enforcing pluralistic behavioral policies in real-world LLM interactions. Our work contributes both the dataset and analytical framework to support future research toward robust and context-aware pluralistic alignment techniques."}

Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of iterative distillation and fine-tuning, making the approach suitable for deployment in resource-limited settings.'}

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly.

Consequently, fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces, introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals.

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration.

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.'}

To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing.

To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks. Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.'}

In this work, we introduce GEMMA-SQL, a lightweight and efficient text-to-SQL model built upon the open-source Gemma 2B architecture. Unlike many large language models (LLMs), GEMMA-SQL is fine-tuned in a resource-efficient, iterative manner and can be deployed on low-cost hardware. Leveraging the SPIDER benchmark for training and evaluation, GEMMA-SQL combines multiple prompting strategies, including few-shot learning, to enhance SQL query generation accuracy. The instruction-tuned variant, GEMMA-SQL Instruct, achieves 66.8% Test-Suite accuracy and 63.3% Exact Set Match accuracy, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines such as IRNet, RYANSQL, and CodeXDavinci. The proposed approach demonstrates that effective prompt design and targeted instruction tuning can significantly boost performance while maintaining high scalability and adaptability. These results position GEMMA-SQL as a practical, open-source alternative for robust and accessible text-to-SQL systems.'}

We study the framework of \\emph{language generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \\emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \\subseteq M \\subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property."}

Understanding how different populations respond to information is crucial for designing effective interventions, yet real-world experimentation is impractical and ethically challenging. To address this, we develop an agent-based simulation using Large Language Models (LLMs) to model responses to misinformation. We construct agent personas spanning five professions and three mental schemas, and evaluate their reactions to news headlines. Our findings show that LLM-generated agents align closely with ground-truth labels and human predictions, supporting their use as proxies for studying information responses. We also find that mental schemas, more than professional background, influence how agents interpret misinformation. This work provides a validation of LLMs to be used as agents in an agent-based model of an information network for analyzing trust, polarization, and susceptibility to deceptive content in complex social systems.'}

Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.'}

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model\'s trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.'}

This requires continuous awareness of the dynamic environment: hazards emerge, opportunities arise, and other agents act, while the agent's reasoning is still unfolding. Despite advances in language model reasoning, existing approaches fail to account for this dynamic nature. We introduce real-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving environments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two paradigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which employ language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses, and (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex problems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with making logical and timely judgments in either paradigm. To address this limitation, we propose AgileThinker, which simultaneously engages both reasoning paradigms. AgileThinker consistently outperforms agents engaging only one reasoning paradigm as the task difficulty and time pressure rise, effectively balancing reasoning depth and response latency. Our work establishes real-time reasoning as a critical testbed for developing practical agents and provides a foundation for research in temporally constrained AI systems, highlighting a path toward real-time capable agents."}

Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to overcome these barriers and speed up the transition of PdM from research to industrial practice. Under these conditions, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents to support PdM cleaning pipelines. Specifically, we focus on maintenance logs, a critical data source for training well-performing machine learning (ML) models, but one often affected by errors such as typos, missing fields, near-duplicate entries, and incorrect dates. We evaluate LLM agents on cleaning tasks involving six distinct types of noise. Our findings show that LLMs are effective at handling generic cleaning tasks and offer a promising foundation for future industrial applications. While domain-specific errors remain challenging, these results highlight the potential for further improvements through specialized training and enhanced agentic capabilities.'}

They enable high-level architectural reasoning, guide design decisions, and facilitate effective communication among diverse stakeholders. However, in practice, SADs are often missing, outdated, or poorly aligned with the system's actual implementation. Consequently, developers are compelled to derive architectural insights directly from source code-a time-intensive process that increases cognitive load, slows new developer onboarding, and contributes to the gradual degradation of clarity over the system's lifetime. To address these issues, we propose a semi-automated generation of SADs from source code by integrating reverse engineering (RE) techniques with a Large Language Model (LLM). Our approach recovers both static and behavioral architectural views by extracting a comprehensive component diagram, filtering architecturally significant elements (core components) via prompt engineering, and generating state machine diagrams to model component behavior based on underlying code logic with few-shots prompting. This resulting views representation offer a scalable and maintainable alternative to traditional manual architectural documentation. This methodology, demonstrated using C++ examples, highlights the potent capability of LLMs to: 1) abstract the component diagram, thereby reducing the reliance on human expert involvement, and 2) accurately represent complex software behaviors, especially when enriched with domain-specific knowledge through few-shot prompting. These findings suggest a viable path toward significantly reducing manual effort while enhancing system understanding and long-term maintainability."}

Still, restricted access to proprietary model architectures hinders their adaption to specific tasks like SDV code generation. In this study, we propose using prompts, a common and basic strategy to interact with LLMs and redirect their responses. Using only system prompts with an appropriate and efficient prompt structure designed using advanced prompt engineering techniques, LLMs can be crafted without requiring a training session or access to their base design. This research investigates the extensive experiments on different models by applying various prompting techniques, including bare models, using a benchmark specifically created to evaluate LLMs' performance in generating SDV code. The results reveal that the model with a few-shot prompting strategy outperforms the others in adjusting the LLM answers to match the expected outcomes based on quantitative metrics."}

While large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-3-8B achieve strong accuracy in text classification, their deployment in security systems requires assessing reliability beyond benchmark performance. To address this, this study introduces the Trustworthiness Calibration Framework (TCF), a reproducible methodology for evaluating phishing detectors across three dimensions: calibration, consistency, and robustness. These components are integrated into a bounded index, the Trustworthiness Calibration Index (TCI), and complemented by the Cross-Dataset Stability (CDS) metric that quantifies stability of trustworthiness across datasets. Experiments conducted on five corpora, such as SecureMail 2025, Phishing Validation 2024, CSDMC2010, Enron-Spam, and Nazario, using DeBERTa-v3-base, LLaMA-3-8B, and GPT-4 demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves the strongest overall trust profile, followed by LLaMA-3-8B and DeBERTa-v3-base. Statistical analysis confirms that reliability varies independently of raw accuracy, underscoring the importance of trust-aware evaluation for real-world deployment. The proposed framework establishes a transparent and reproducible foundation for assessing model dependability in LLM-based phishing detection.'}
