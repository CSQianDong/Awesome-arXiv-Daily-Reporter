Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias."}

To better leverage narrow training data, we propose contrastive weight steering, a simple post-training method that edits the model parameters using weight arithmetic. We isolate a behavior direction in weight-space by subtracting the weight deltas from two small fine-tunes -- one that induces the desired behavior and another that induces its opposite -- and then add or remove this direction to modify the model\'s weights. We apply this technique to mitigate sycophancy and induce misalignment, and find that weight steering often generalizes further than activation steering, achieving stronger out-of-distribution behavioral control before degrading general capabilities. We also show that, in the context of task-specific fine-tuning, weight steering can partially mitigate undesired behavioral drift: it can reduce sycophancy and under-refusals introduced during fine-tuning while preserving task performance gains. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that emergent misalignment can be detected by measuring the similarity between fine-tuning updates and an "evil" weight direction, suggesting that it may be possible to monitor the evolution of weights during training and detect rare misaligned behaviors that never manifest during training or evaluations.'}

First, we introduce Chain-of-Personalized-Reasoning (CoPeR) to capture individual preferences through interpretable reasoning chains. Second, we propose an expectation-maximization-based Majority-Minority Preference-Aware Clustering (M2PC) algorithm that discovers distinct user groups in an unsupervised manner to learn group-level preferences. Finally, we integrate these components into a preference-adaptive reinforcement learning framework (PAda-PPO) that jointly optimizes alignment with both individual and group preferences.

However, over the last three decades, this view has changed considerably. Numerous studies have aimed to model and understand the architecture of the bilingual word recognition system Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), investigating how parallel activation operates in the brain and how one language influences another Kroll et al. (2015). Increasingly, evidence suggests that multilinguals, individuals who speak three or more languages, can perform better than monolinguals in various linguistic and cognitive tasks, such as learning an additional language Abu-Rabia and Sanitsky (2010). This research proposal focuses on the study of the mental lexicon and how it may be structured in individuals who speak multiple languages. Building on the work of Stella et al. (2018), who investigated explosive learning in humans using a multiplex model of the mental lexicon, and the Bilingual Interactive Activation (BIA+) framework proposed by Dijkstra and van Heuven (2002), the present study applies the same multilayer network principles introduced by Kivela et al. (2014). Our experimental design extends previous research by incorporating multimodality into the multiplex model, introducing an additional layer that connects visual inputs to their corresponding lexical representations across the multilingual layers of the mental lexicon. In this research, we aim to explore how a heritage language influences the acquisition of another language. Specifically, we ask: Does the presence of visual input in a translation task influence participants' proficiency and accuracy compared to text-only conditions?"}

However, current subword tokenizers like SentencePiece or HuggingFace BPE are mostly designed for Latin or multilingual corpora and do not perform well on languages with rich morphology such as Bengali. To address this limitation, we present BengaliBPE, a Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer specifically developed for the Bengali script. BengaliBPE applies Unicode normalization, grapheme-level initialization, and morphology-aware merge rules to maintain linguistic consistency and preserve subword integrity. We use a large-scale Bengali news classification dataset to compare BengaliBPE with three baselines: Whitespace, SentencePiece BPE, and HuggingFace BPE. The evaluation considers tokenization granularity, encoding speed, and downstream classification accuracy. While all methods perform reasonably well, BengaliBPE provides the most detailed segmentation and the best morphological interpretability, albeit with slightly higher computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of language-aware tokenization for morphologically rich scripts and establish BengaliBPE as a strong foundation for future Bengali NLP systems, including large-scale pretraining of contextual language models.'}

We use two different approaches for retrieval: regular expressions and large language models (LLMs). Our baseline was a simple method employing regular expressions to identify typical words occurring before and after the description. The advanced regular expression approach further focused on "sparing" and its normalization (insertion of spaces between individual letters), typical for delineating the description. The LLM approach involved prompting the Gemini Flash 2.0 model to extract the descriptions using predefined instructions. Although the baseline identified descriptions in only 40.5% of verdicts, both methods significantly outperformed it, achieving 97% with advanced regular expressions and 98.75% with LLMs, and 99.5% when combined. Evaluation by law students showed that both advanced methods matched human annotations in about 90% of cases, compared to just 34.5% for the baseline.

Their typically unscripted, multi-themed, and conversational style offers a rich but complex form of data. To analyze how podcasts persuade and inform, we must examine their narrative structures -- specifically, the narrative frames they employ.\nThe fluid and conversational nature of podcasts presents a significant challenge for automated analysis. We show that existing large language models, typically trained on more structured text such as news articles, struggle to capture the subtle cues that human listeners rely on to identify narrative frames. As a result, current approaches fall short of accurately analyzing podcast narratives at scale.\nTo solve this, we develop and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model that explicitly links narrative frames to specific entities mentioned in the conversation, effectively grounding the abstract frame in concrete details. Our approach then uses these granular frame labels and correlates them with high-level topics to reveal broader discourse trends. The primary contributions of this paper are: (i) a novel frame-labeling methodology that more closely aligns with human judgment for messy, conversational data, and (ii) a new analysis that uncovers the systematic relationship between what is being discussed (the topic) and how it is being presented (the frame), offering a more robust framework for studying influence in digital media.'}

Existing approaches predominantly rely on context injection, where user history is embedded into the prompt to directly guide the generation process. However, this single-step paradigm imposes a dual burden on the model: generating accurate content while simultaneously aligning with user-specific styles. This often results in a trade-off that compromises output quality and limits precise control. To address this fundamental tension, we propose Reflective Personalization Optimization (RPO), a novel framework that redefines the personalization paradigm by decoupling content generation from alignment. RPO operates in two distinct stages: first, a base model generates a high-quality, generic response; then, an external reflection module explicitly rewrites this output to align with the user's preferences. This reflection module is trained using a two-stage process. Initially, supervised fine-tuning is employed on structured rewriting trajectories to establish a core personalized reasoning policy that models the transformation from generic to user-aligned responses. Subsequently, reinforcement learning is applied to further refine and enhance the quality of the personalized outputs. Comprehensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that RPO, by decoupling content generation from personalization, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings underscore the superiority of explicit response shaping over implicit context injection. Moreover, RPO introduces an efficient, model-agnostic personalization layer that can be seamlessly integrated with any underlying base model, paving the way for a new and effective direction in user-centric generation scenarios."}

In addition they have also shown impressive capabilities in different domains, like coding, science and math. In this short paper, taking math as an example domain, we study the performance of different LLMs across languages. Experimental results show that there exists a non-negligible and consistent gap in the performance of the models across languages. Interestingly, and somewhat against expectations, the gap exists for both high- and low-resource languages. We hope that these results influence further research into cross-lingual capability generalization for next generation LLMs. If it weren't for the fact that they are false! By analyzing one of the standard multilingual math benchmarks (MGSM), we determine that several translation errors are present in the data. Furthermore, the lack of standardized answer extraction from LLM outputs further influences the final results. We propose a method for automatic quality assurance to address the first issue at scale, and give recommendations to address the second one. Combining these two approaches we show that the aforementioned language gap mostly disappears, leading to completely different conclusions from our research.

Several existing approaches are reviewed, with a discussion of their respective strengths and limitations. An improved method based on the ShortGPT approach has been developed, building upon the idea of incorporating iterative evaluation of layer importance. At each step, importance is assessed by measuring performance degradation when individual layers are removed, using a set of representative datasets. This process is combined with further training using a joint loss function based on KL divergence and mean squared error. Experiments on the Qwen2.5-3B model show that the number of layers can be reduced from 36 to 28 (resulting in a 2.47 billion parameter model) with only a 9.7% quality loss, and to 24 layers with an 18% loss. The findings suggest that the middle transformer layers contribute less to inference, underscoring the potential of the proposed method for creating efficient models.

This report empirically assesses the performance of two major classes of general-purpose LLMs, demonstrating their linguistic capabilities and foundational readiness for the task compared to a human benchmark. Using a comparative analysis of the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B and the reasoning-augmented QWen2.5 32B, we identify a potential architectural advantage in the instruction-tuned LLM. Mistral exhibits a tempered lexical simplification strategy that enhances readability across a suite of metrics and the simplification-specific formula SARI (mean 42.46), while preserving human-level discourse with a BERTScore of 0.91. QWen also attains enhanced readability performance, but its operational strategy shows a disconnect in balancing between readability and accuracy, reaching a statistically significantly lower BERTScore of 0.89. Additionally, a comprehensive correlation analysis of 21 metrics spanning readability, discourse fidelity, content safety, and underlying distributional measures for mechanistic insights, confirms strong functional redundancies among five readability indices. This empirical evidence tracks baseline performance of the evolving LLMs for the task of text simplification, identifies the instruction-tuned Mistral 24B for simplification, provides necessary heuristics for metric selection, and points to lexical support as a primary domain-adaptation issue for simplification.'}

In contrast, we focus on the commonalities among LMs, which can deepen our understanding of LMs and even facilitate cross-model knowledge transfer. In this work, we introduce the Order-Level Attention (OLA) derived from the order-wise decomposition of Attention Rollout and reveal that the OLA at the same order across LMs exhibits significant similarities. Furthermore, we discover an implicit mapping between OLA and syntactic knowledge. Based on these two findings, we propose the Transferable OLA Adapter (TOA), a training-free cross-LM adapter transfer method. Specifically, we treat the OLA as a unified syntactic feature representation and train an adapter that takes OLA as input.

To investigate this, we introduce the Moral RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful'' and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned models performing particularly poorly.

However, its relatively loose editorial policy has also led to a degree of taxonomic inconsistency. Building on prior work, this study proposes and applies a novel validation method to confirm the presence of classification errors, over-generalized subclass links, and redundant connections in specific domains of Wikidata. We further introduce a new evaluation criterion for determining whether such issues warrant correction and develop a system that allows users to inspect the taxonomic relationships of arbitrary Wikidata entities-leveraging the platform's crowdsourced nature to its full potential."}

These emerging capabilities have given rise to surge research interests in developing LLM agent for facilitating scientific quest. One key application in AI research is to automate experiment design through agentic dataset and baseline retrieval. However, prior efforts suffer from limited data coverage, as recommendation datasets primarily harvest candidates from public portals and omit many datasets actually used in published papers, and from an overreliance on content similarity that biases model toward superficial similarity and overlooks experimental suitability. Harnessing collective perception embedded in the baseline and dataset citation network, we present a comprehensive framework for baseline and dataset recommendation. First, we design an automated data-collection pipeline that links roughly one hundred thousand accepted papers to the baselines and datasets they actually used. Second, we propose a collective perception enhanced retriever. To represent the position of each dataset or baseline within the scholarly network, it concatenates self-descriptions with aggregated citation contexts. To achieve efficient candidate recall, we finetune an embedding model on these representations. Finally, we develop a reasoning-augmented reranker that exact interaction chains to construct explicit reasoning chains and finetunes a large language model to produce interpretable justifications and refined rankings. The dataset we curated covers 85\\% of the datasets and baselines used at top AI conferences over the past five years. On our dataset, the proposed method outperforms the strongest prior baseline with average gains of +5.85\\% in Recall@20, +8.30\\% in HitRate@5.

While recent advances have extended context windows to 100K-1M tokens, such approaches incur prohibitive costs for resource constrained deployments. We propose BudgetMem, a novel memory augmented architecture that learns what to remember rather than remembering everything. Our system combines selective memory policies with feature based salience scoring (entity density, TF-IDF, discourse markers, position bias) to decide which information merits storage under strict budget constraints. Unlike existing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems that store all chunks, BudgetMem employs learned gating mechanisms coupled with BM25 sparse retrieval for efficient information access. Through comprehensive experiments on 700 question answer pairs across short (237 tokens) and long (5K-10K tokens) documents with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, we demonstrate that BudgetMem achieves remarkable results on long documents: only 1.0% F1 score degradation while saving 72.4% memory compared to baseline RAG. We validate our approach through budget sensitivity analysis (testing 7 budget ratios), naive baseline comparisons, and document length analysis, showing that BudgetMem's benefits increase with document length. Our work provides a practical pathway for deploying capable long context systems on modest hardware, democratizing access to advanced language understanding capabilities."}

To address this critical gap, we introduce SDS KoPub VDR, the first large-scale, publicly available benchmark for retrieving and understanding Korean public documents. The benchmark is built upon a corpus of 361 real-world documents (40,781 pages), including 256 files under the KOGL Type 1 license and 105 from official legal portals, capturing complex visual elements like tables, charts, and multi-column layouts. To establish a challenging and reliable evaluation set, we constructed 600 query-page-answer triples. These were initially generated using multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) and subsequently underwent a rigorous human verification and refinement process to ensure factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The queries span six major public domains and are systematically categorized by the reasoning modality required: text-based, visual-based (e.g., chart interpretation), and cross-modal. We evaluate SDS KoPub VDR on two complementary tasks that reflect distinct retrieval paradigms: (1) text-only retrieval, which measures a model's ability to locate relevant document pages based solely on textual signals, and (2) multimodal retrieval, which assesses retrieval performance when visual features (e.g., tables, charts, and layouts) are jointly leveraged alongside text. This dual-task evaluation reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly in multimodal scenarios requiring cross-modal reasoning, even for state-of-the-art models. As a foundational resource, SDS KoPub VDR not only enables rigorous and fine-grained evaluation across textual and multimodal retrieval tasks but also provides a clear roadmap for advancing multimodal AI in complex, real-world document intelligence."}

This capability raises safety concerns as it may, for example, allow models to better conceal their true abilities during evaluation. We attempt to characterize the minimal conditions under which such self-awareness emerges, and the mechanistic processes through which it manifests. Through controlled finetuning experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs with low-rank adapters (LoRA), we find: (1) that self-awareness can be reliably induced using a single rank-1 LoRA adapter; (2) that the learned self-aware behavior can be largely captured by a single steering vector in activation space, recovering nearly all of the fine-tune's behavioral effect; and (3) that self-awareness is non-universal and domain-localized, with independent representations across tasks. Together, these findings suggest that behavioral self-awareness emerges as a domain-specific, linear feature that can be easily induced and modulated."}

While base LLMs are known to exhibit next-token calibration, it remains unclear whether they can assess confidence in the actual meaning of their responses beyond the token level. We find that, when using a certain sampling-based notion of semantic calibration, base LLMs are remarkably well-calibrated: they can meaningfully assess confidence in open-domain question-answering tasks, despite not being explicitly trained to do so. Our main theoretical contribution establishes a mechanism for why semantic calibration emerges as a byproduct of next-token prediction, leveraging a recent connection between calibration and local loss optimality. The theory relies on a general definition of "B-calibration," which is a notion of calibration parameterized by a choice of equivalence classes (semantic or otherwise). This theoretical mechanism leads to a testable prediction: base LLMs will be semantically calibrated when they can easily predict their own distribution over semantic answer classes before generating a response. We state three implications of this prediction, which we validate through experiments: (1) Base LLMs are semantically calibrated across question-answering tasks, (2) RL instruction-tuning systematically breaks this calibration, and (3) chain-of-thought reasoning breaks calibration. To our knowledge, our work provides the first principled explanation of when and why semantic calibration emerges in LLMs.'}

The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) family has demonstrated strong performance in training LLMs with RLVR. However, as models train longer and scale larger, more training prompts become residual prompts, those with zero variance rewards that provide no training signal. Consequently, fewer prompts contribute to training, reducing diversity and hindering effectiveness. To fully exploit these residual prompts, we propose the Explore Residual Prompts in Policy Optimization (ERPO) framework, which encourages exploration on residual prompts and reactivates their training signals. ERPO maintains a history tracker for each prompt and adaptively increases the sampling temperature for residual prompts that previously produced all correct responses. This encourages the model to generate more diverse reasoning traces, introducing incorrect responses that revive training signals. Empirical results on the Qwen2.5 series demonstrate that ERPO consistently surpasses strong baselines across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks.'}

Current training sample influence estimation methods (also known as influence functions) undertake this goal by utilizing information flow through the model via its first-order and higher-order gradient terms. However, owing to the large model sizes of today consisting of billions of parameters, these influence computations are often restricted to some subset of model layers to ensure computational feasibility. Prior seminal work by Yeh et al. (2022) in assessing which layers are best suited for computing language data influence concluded that the first (embedding) layers are the most informative for this purpose, using a hypothesis based on influence scores canceling out (i.e., the cancellation effect). In this work, we propose theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrating how the cancellation effect is unreliable, and that middle attention layers are better estimators for influence. Furthermore, we address the broader challenge of aggregating influence scores across layers, and showcase how alternatives to standard averaging (such as ranking and vote-based methods) can lead to significantly improved performance. Finally, we propose better methods for evaluating influence score efficacy in LLMs without undertaking model retraining, and propose a new metric known as the Noise Detection Rate (NDR) that exhibits strong predictive capability compared to the cancellation effect. Through extensive experiments across LLMs of varying types and scales, we concretely determine that the first (layers) are not necessarily better than the last (layers) for LLM influence estimation, contrasting with prior knowledge in the field.'}

However, involving more documents could introduce significant noise, as many documents may be irrelevant or misleading, thereby reducing the overall accuracy of the generated responses. To overcome the challenge associated with handling a larger number of documents, we propose WinnowRAG, a novel RAG framework designed to systematically filter out noisy documents while preserving valuable content -- a process we refer to as winnowing. WinnowRAG operates in two stages: In Stage I, we perform query-aware clustering to group similar documents and form distinct topic clusters. Each cluster is assigned to an LLM agent for generating a unique answer. In Stage II, we perform winnowing, wherein a critic LLM evaluates the outputs of multiple agents and iteratively separates useful documents from noisy ones. To retain useful documents when discarding agents, we propose two strategic merging techniques to ensure that only relevant knowledge is used for generating the final response. Crucially, WinnowRAG is model-agnostic and does not require any model fine-tuning, making it easily adaptable to various tasks. Extensive experiments on various realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WinnowRAG over state-of-the-art baselines.'}

Thus, enforcing an instruction hierarchy (IH) in LLMs, where higher-level directives override lower-priority requests, is critical for the reliability and controllability of LLMs. In this work, we reframe instruction hierarchy resolution as a reasoning task. Specifically, the model must first "think" about the relationship between a given user prompt and higher-priority (system) instructions before generating a response. To enable this capability via training, we construct VerIH, an instruction hierarchy dataset of constraint-following tasks with verifiable answers. This dataset comprises both aligned and conflicting system-user instructions. We show that lightweight reinforcement learning with VerIH effectively transfers general reasoning capabilities of models to instruction prioritization. Our finetuned models achieve consistent improvements on instruction following and instruction hierarchy benchmarks. This reasoning ability also generalizes to safety-critical settings beyond the training distribution. By treating safety issues as resolving conflicts between adversarial user inputs and predefined higher-priority policies, our trained model enhances robustness against jailbreak and prompt injection attacks. These results demonstrate that reasoning over instruction hierarchies provides a practical path to reliable LLMs, where updates to system prompts yield controllable and robust changes in model behavior.'}

To address this issue, we propose SARC, a Sentiment-Augmented Role Clustering framework which utilizes sentiment-enhanced deep clustering to identify user roles for improved fake news detection. The framework first generates user features through joint comment text representation (with BiGRU and Attention mechanism) and sentiment encoding. It then constructs a differentiable deep clustering module to automatically categorize user roles. Finally, unlike existing approaches which take fake news label as the unique supervision signal, we propose a joint optimization objective integrating role clustering and fake news detection to further improve the model performance.

We study the framework of \\emph{language generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \\emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \\emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \\subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \\emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \\subseteq M \\subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property."}

Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking, retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval (IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models. Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full implementation on GitHub.'}

To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.'}

Public speaking is a necessary skill for future engineers as they have to communicate technical knowledge with diverse stakeholders. While universities offer courses or workshops, they are unable to offer sustained and personalized training to students. Providing comprehensive feedback on both verbal and non-verbal aspects of public speaking is time-intensive, making consistent and individualized assessment impractical. This study integrates research on verbal and non-verbal cues in public speaking to develop an AI-driven assessment model for engineering students. Our approach combines speech analysis, computer vision, and sentiment detection into a multi-modal AI system that provides assessment and feedback. The model evaluates (1) verbal communication (pitch, loudness, pacing, intonation), (2) non-verbal communication (facial expressions, gestures, posture), and (3) expressive coherence, a novel integration ensuring alignment between speech and body language. Unlike previous systems that assess these aspects separately, our model fuses multiple modalities to deliver personalized, scalable feedback. Preliminary testing demonstrated that our AI-generated feedback was moderately aligned with expert evaluations. Among the state-of-the-art AI models evaluated, all of which were Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini and OpenAI models, Gemini Pro emerged as the best-performing, showing the strongest agreement with human annotators. By eliminating reliance on human evaluators, this AI-driven public speaking trainer enables repeated practice, helping students naturally align their speech with body language and emotion, crucial for impactful and professional communication.'}

Traditional expert-only workflows are time-consuming, backlog-prone, and struggle to keep pace with shifting regulatory boundaries. We demo ORCHID, a modular agentic system for HRP classification that pairs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with human oversight to produce policy-based outputs that can be audited. Small cooperating agents, retrieval, description refiner, classifier, validator, and feedback logger, coordinate via agent-to-agent messaging and invoke tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for model-agnostic on-premise operation. The interface follows an Item to Evidence to Decision loop with step-by-step reasoning, on-policy citations, and append-only audit bundles (run-cards, prompts, evidence). In preliminary tests on real HRP cases, ORCHID improves accuracy and traceability over a non-agentic baseline while deferring uncertain items to Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). The demonstration shows single item submission, grounded citations, SME feedback capture, and exportable audit artifacts, illustrating a practical path to trustworthy LLM assistance in sensitive DOE compliance workflows.'}

We provide a different score, aver, and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more "natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to interpret aver scores.'}

This study introduces G-TRACE (GenAI Transformative Carbon Estimator), a cross-modal, region-aware framework that quantifies training- and inference-related emissions across modalities and deployment geographies. Using real-world analytics and microscopic simulation, G-TRACE measures energy use and carbon intensity per output type (text, image, video) and reveals how decentralized inference amplifies small per-query energy costs into system-level impacts. Through the Ghibli-style image generation trend (2024-2025), we estimate 4,309 MWh of energy consumption and 2,068 tCO2 emissions, illustrating how viral participation inflates individual digital actions into tonne-scale consequences. Building on these findings, we propose the AI Sustainability Pyramid, a seven-level governance model linking carbon accounting metrics (L1-L7) with operational readiness, optimization, and stewardship. This framework translates quantitative emission metrics into actionable policy guidance for sustainable AI deployment. The study contributes to the quantitative assessment of emerging digital infrastructures as a novel category of climate risk, supporting adaptive governance for sustainable technology deployment.

Yet, the safety implications of these extended contexts remain unclear. To bridge this gap, we introduce NINJA (short for Needle-in-haystack jailbreak attack), a method that jailbreaks aligned LMs by appending benign, model-generated content to harmful user goals. Critical to our method is the observation that the position of harmful goals play an important role in safety. Experiments on standard safety benchmark, HarmBench, show that NINJA significantly increases attack success rates across state-of-the-art open and proprietary models, including LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemini. Unlike prior jailbreaking methods, our approach is low-resource, transferable, and less detectable. Moreover, we show that NINJA is compute-optimal -- under a fixed compute budget, increasing context length can outperform increasing the number of trials in best-of-N jailbreak. These findings reveal that even benign long contexts -- when crafted with careful goal positioning -- introduce fundamental vulnerabilities in modern LMs.'}

Traditionally, these reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses, magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats, represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and students of field geology.'}

This paper examines the interplay between KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model\'s trained context window (e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence. Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.'}
