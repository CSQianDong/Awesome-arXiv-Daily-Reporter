Epure, Harin Lee, Manuel Moussallam', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16708', 'abstract': 'One particularly promising use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation is the automatic generation of Natural Language (NL) user taste profiles from consumption data. These profiles offer interpretable and editable alternatives to opaque collaborative filtering representations, enabling greater transparency and user control. However, it remains unclear whether users consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste, which is crucial for trust and usability. Moreover, because LLMs inherit societal and data-driven biases, profile quality may systematically vary across user and item characteristics. In this paper, we study this issue in the context of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and culturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate NL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether identification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g., mainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of origin). We also compare these patterns to those observed when using the profiles in a downstream recommendation task. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of scrutable, LLM-based profiling in personalized systems.'}

This paper introduces a model-agnostic approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the reranking of complementary product recommendations. Unlike previous works that use LLMs primarily for data preprocessing and graph augmentation, our method applies LLM-based prompting strategies directly to rerank candidate items retrieved from existing recommendation models, eliminating the need for model retraining. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach effectively balances accuracy and diversity in complementary product recommendations, with at least 50% lift in accuracy metrics and 2% lift in diversity metrics on average for the top recommended items across datasets.'}

Developers integrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment of the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be tested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With most previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been paid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we present ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of complex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user interactions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to previous approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as it does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the implementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection performance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in the prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator based on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue systems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and scalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate the development of robust dialogue systems.'}

However, developers frequently produce tangled commits that mix unrelated changes due to practical constraints or unclear boundaries, negatively impacting code review and maintenance. Although prior commit untangling approaches: rule-based, feature-based, or graph-based, have made progress, they often rely on shallow signals and fail to distinguish between explicit dependencies (e.g., control/data flow) and implicit ones (e.g., semantic or conceptual relationships). In this paper, we propose ColaUntangle, a new collaborative consultation framework for commit untangling that models both explicit and implicit dependencies among code changes. ColaUntangle integrates Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in a multi-agent architecture: one agent specializes in explicit dependencies, another in implicit ones, and a reviewer agent synthesizes their perspectives through iterative consultation. To capture explicit and implicit contextual information, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG), enabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and semantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C# and 14k Java tangled commits). Experimental results show that ColaUntangle outperforms the best-performing baseline, achieving an improvement of 44% on the C# dataset and 100% on the Java dataset.

Designed to address limitations in large language models (LLMs), Agentic Flow comprises five interdependent modules such as Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Memory, and Action arranged in a recurrent cognitive loop. Although originally inspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively aligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including predictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.\nTo assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with baseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent achieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while the baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed at proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may emerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.\nWe introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures design-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new theory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures shaped by real-world implementation demands. This paper should be read as a position paper - an exploratory reflection on how implementation can surface latent structural echoes of cognitive theory, without asserting theoretical unification."}

However, existing TEE implementations are not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently. In this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three environments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and evaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.\nOur first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other models in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for resource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit quantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain of up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We further validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks. These validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying lightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD applications.'}

More importantly, we reveal and critically examine an implicit assumption in prior work: intermediate reasoning steps are hidden from adversaries. By relaxing this assumption, we identify an important security risk, intuitively motivated and empirically verified as an inverse scaling law: if intermediate reasoning steps become explicitly accessible, increased inference-time computation consistently reduces model robustness. Finally, we discuss practical scenarios where models with hidden reasoning chains are still vulnerable to attacks, such as models with tool-integrated reasoning and advanced reasoning extraction attacks. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the robustness benefits of inference-time scaling depend heavily on the adversarial setting and deployment context.

Traditional automated translation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which often lack flexibility and scalability.

In this paper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative framework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling in-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's automated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models, narrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of closed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation module, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code samples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity. ACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a comprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its controller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting hyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based on real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to continue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the process. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the effectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a secure and reliable alternative.

This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean of human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments, and subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to engage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This paper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these problem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces addressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the former problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter requires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking into account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural language. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects solution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions from the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language solutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality dimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual diversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations. Emotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable metric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts introduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the capabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of LLMs.'}

Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution.

Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck challenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a single prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we propose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO optimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit LLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by maximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses, theoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise, resulting in effective value instructions.

The model learns soft prompt embeddings with first-order (Reptile) and second-order (MAML) optimization by treating each of the users as the tasks. As augmentations to the input tokens, these learnable vectors are the differentiable control variables that represent user behavioral priors.

Our analysis shows improvements stem from better detection of false positives that are previously incorrectly identified as prompt-aligned. Theoretically, we show the aligned training dynamics between generation and understanding allow reduced prompt-misaligned generations to also improve mismatch detection in the understanding branch. Additionally, the framework reveals a potential risk of co-degradation under poor supervision-an overlooked phenomenon that is empirically validated in our experiments. Notably, we find intrinsic metrics like Nonunified score cannot distinguish co-degradation from co-improvement, which highlights the necessity of data quality check. Finally, we propose a curriculum-based strategy based on our findings that gradually introduces harder samples as the model improves, leading to better unification and improved MLLM generation and understanding."}

To address these issues, the Pre-Training Data Detection (PDD) task was proposed to identify if specific data was included in an LLM's pre-training corpus. However, existing PDD methods often rely on superficial features like prediction confidence and loss, resulting in mediocre performance. To improve this, we introduce NA-PDD, a novel algorithm analyzing differential neuron activation patterns between training and non-training data in LLMs. This is based on the observation that these data types activate different neurons during LLM inference. We also introduce CCNewsPDD, a temporally unbiased benchmark employing rigorous data transformations to ensure consistent time distributions between training and non-training data. Our experiments demonstrate that NA-PDD significantly outperforms existing methods across three benchmarks and multiple LLMs."}

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data, it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.'}

Today, almost all successful applications of RL for reasoning use binary reward functions that evaluate the correctness of LM outputs. Because such reward functions do not penalize guessing or low-confidence outputs, they often have the unintended side-effect of degrading calibration and increasing the rate at which LMs generate incorrect responses (or "hallucinate") in other problem domains. This paper describes RLCR (Reinforcement Learning with Calibration Rewards), an approach to training reasoning models that jointly improves accuracy and calibrated confidence estimation. During RLCR, LMs generate both predictions and numerical confidence estimates after reasoning. They are trained to optimize a reward function that augments a binary correctness score with a Brier score -- a scoring rule for confidence estimates that incentivizes calibrated prediction. We first prove that this reward function (or any analogous reward function that uses a bounded, proper scoring rule) yields models whose predictions are both accurate and well-calibrated. We next show that across diverse datasets, RLCR substantially improves calibration with no loss in accuracy, on both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations -- outperforming both ordinary RL training and classifiers trained to assign post-hoc confidence scores. While ordinary RL hurts calibration, RLCR improves it. Finally, we demonstrate that verbalized confidence can be leveraged at test time to improve accuracy and calibration via confidence-weighted scaling methods. Our results show that explicitly optimizing for calibration can produce more generally reliable reasoning models.'}

This enriched, context-specific data is then integrated with an input prompt for an LLM, enabling it to generate detailed explanations and interpretations of why the flow was identified as malicious by NIDS. We compare the generated interpretations against a Basic-Prompt Explainer baseline, which does not incorporate any contextual information into the LLM's input prompt. Our framework is quantitatively evaluated using the Llama 3 and GPT-4 models, employing a novel evaluation method tailored for natural language explanations, focusing on their correctness and consistency.

We have developed a training and inference pipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture modification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design Optimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses sub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and fine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI elements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable components to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while enhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but key issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline processes real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions for code generation and ensures reliability.

Six frontier models, including three "reasoning-tuned" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python outputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they reused the baseline solution or adapted.

We observe that independently trained reward models on the same preference dataset can exhibit substantial disagreement, highlighting the instability of current alignment strategies. Employing a theoretical model, we demonstrate that variability in reward model estimation can cause overfitting, leading to the risk of performance degradation.

Sukhatme', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16068', 'abstract': 'Multi-robot coordination has traditionally relied on a task-specific and expert-driven pipeline, where natural language mission descriptions are manually translated by domain experts into mathematical formulation, algorithm design, and executable code. This conventional process is labor-intensive, inaccessible to non-experts, and inflexible to changes in mission requirements. Here, we propose LAN2CB (Language to Collective Behavior), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to streamline and generalize the multi-robot coordination pipeline. LAN2CB directly converts natural language mission descriptions into executable Python code for multi-robot systems through two key components: (1) Mission Decomposition for Task Representation, which parses the mission into a task graph with dependencies, and (2) Code Generation, which uses the task graph and a structured knowledge base to generate deployable robot control code. We further introduce a dataset of natural language mission specifications to support development and benchmarking. Experimental results in both simulation and real-world settings show that LAN2CB enables effective and flexible multi-robot coordination from natural language, significantly reducing the need for manual engineering while supporting generalization across mission types.

Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited working memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model inference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and GPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as reasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences. The reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and conclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During generation, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states of the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning mechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages throughout reasoning. Experimental results show that our system sustains high inference throughput, even when manipulating up to 90% of the KV cache in GPU memory. It also delivers accurate reasoning on mathematical tasks and handles information retrieval challenges that require long-horizon reasoning and multi-hop tool use.'}

In fact, the prevalent large proprietary models could hardly generate verifiable programs. A promising yet largely uncharted alternative is formal language-based reasoning. Grounding LLMs in rigorous formal systems where generative models operate in formal language spaces (e.g., Dafny) enables the automatic and mathematically provable verification of their reasoning processes and outcomes. This capability is pivotal for achieving large-scale, reliable formal software verification. It is a common practice to employ human-annotated chain-of-thought and other human priors to induce the reasoning and coding capabilities of LLMs. Unfortunately, it becomes unacceptably all-consuming to provide such priors for supervising complex programming tasks. In this work, we systematically explore ways to reduce human priors with the formal language, Dafny, as the main environment for our pilot study. Our pipeline mainly relies on introducing an automatic and scalable data curation pipeline, and careful RL designs integrated with feedback from the formal language verifier. We introduce DafnyComp, a benchmark of compositional formal programs with auto-formalized specifications for specification reasoning. Our supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage enables even small models (e.g., 0.5B) to generate syntactically valid and verifiable Dafny code, surpassing proprietary models. RL with regularization further improves performance, achieving stronger generalization to out-of-domain tasks and outperforming all strong baselines on the challenging DafnyComp benchmark.'}

Jones', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16196', 'abstract': "Recent evidence suggests Large Language Models (LLMs) display Theory of Mind (ToM) abilities. Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial role, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human ToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically intervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning theory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's beliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous evaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans significantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher; $p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model of other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's preferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline condition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state inferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already given someone's preferences). These results suggest a significant gap between human-like social reasoning and LLM abilities."}

Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern identities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal.

The mechanisms through which this can happen are still largely unknown. In this work, we show that the stacking of a self-attention layer with an MLP, allows the transformer block to implicitly modify the weights of the MLP layer according to the context. We argue through theory and experimentation that this simple mechanism may be the reason why LLMs can learn in context and not only during training. Specifically, we show under mild simplifying assumptions how a transformer block implicitly transforms a context into a low-rank weight-update of the MLP layer.'}

However, further enhancing existing MLLMs necessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task complexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent self-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible solution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods augment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data complexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual descriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated, leading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched difficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic, closed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data and model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model, C2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model evolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex multimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with iteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively selects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to conduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.
