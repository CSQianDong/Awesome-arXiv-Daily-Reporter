**Authors**: Jordi Linares-Pellicer, Juan Izquierdo-Domenech, Isabel Ferri-Molla, Carlos Aliaga-Torro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07936)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication. The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage their full potential for collective benefit.

# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation 

**Authors**: Giovanni Mauro, Marco Minici, Luca Pappalardo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07911)  

**Abstract**: Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic algorithmic systems.

# Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis 

**Authors**: Fei-Hsuan Yu, Yun-Cheng Chou, Teng-Ruei Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07872)  

**Abstract**: We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations). This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements. Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.

# 2D-Curri-DPO: Two-Dimensional Curriculum Learning for Direct Preference Optimization 

**Authors**: Mengyang Li, Zhong Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07856)  

**Abstract**: Aligning large language models with human preferences is crucial for their safe deployment. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offers an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback, traditional DPO methods are limited by their reliance on single preference pairs. Recent work like Curriculum-DPO integrates multiple pairs using a one-dimensional difficulty curriculum based on pairwise distinguishability (PD), but overlooks the complexity of the input prompt itself. To address this, we propose 2D-Curri-DPO, a novel framework employing a two-dimensional curriculum that jointly models Prompt Complexity (PC) and Pairwise Distinguishability. This framework introduces dual difficulty metrics to quantify prompt semantic complexity and response preference clarity, defines a curriculum strategy space encompassing multiple selectable strategies for task adaptation, and incorporates a KL-divergence-based adaptive mechanism for dynamic reference model updates to enhance training stability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that 2D-Curri-DPO significantly outperforms standard DPO and prior curriculum methods across multiple benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Vicuna Bench, and WizardLM. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging test sets like UltraFeedback. Ablation studies confirm the benefits of the 2D structure and adaptive mechanisms, while analysis provides guidance for strategy selection. These findings demonstrate that effective alignment requires modeling both prompt complexity and pairwise distinguishability, establishing adaptive, multi-dimensional curriculum learning as a powerful and interpretable new paradigm for preference-based language model optimization.

# Independence Is Not an Issue in Neurosymbolic AI 

**Authors**: Håkan Karlsson Faronius, Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07851)  

**Abstract**: A popular approach to neurosymbolic AI is to take the output of the last layer of a neural network, e.g. a softmax activation, and pass it through a sparse computation graph encoding certain logical constraints one wishes to enforce. This induces a probability distribution over a set of random variables, which happen to be conditionally independent of each other in many commonly used neurosymbolic AI models. Such conditionally independent random variables have been deemed harmful as their presence has been observed to co-occur with a phenomenon dubbed deterministic bias, where systems learn to deterministically prefer one of the valid solutions from the solution space over the others. We provide evidence contesting this conclusion and show that the phenomenon of deterministic bias is an artifact of improperly applying neurosymbolic AI.

# Anytime Single-Step MAPF Planning with Anytime PIBT 

**Authors**: Nayesha Gandotra, Rishi Veerapaneni, Muhammad Suhail Saleem, Daniel Harabor, Jiaoyang Li, Maxim Likhachev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07841)  

**Abstract**: PIBT is a popular Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) method at the core of many state-of-the-art MAPF methods including LaCAM, CS-PIBT, and WPPL. The main utility of PIBT is that it is a very fast and effective single-step MAPF solver and can return a collision-free single-step solution for hundreds of agents in less than a millisecond. However, the main drawback of PIBT is that it is extremely greedy in respect to its priorities and thus leads to poor solution quality. Additionally, PIBT cannot use all the planning time that might be available to it and returns the first solution it finds. We thus develop Anytime PIBT, which quickly finds a one-step solution identically to PIBT but then continuously improves the solution in an anytime manner. We prove that Anytime PIBT converges to the optimal solution given sufficient time. We experimentally validate that Anytime PIBT can rapidly improve single-step solution quality within milliseconds and even find the optimal single-step action. However, we interestingly find that improving the single-step solution quality does not have a significant effect on full-horizon solution costs.

# Deceptive Automated Interpretability: Language Models Coordinating to Fool Oversight Systems 

**Authors**: Simon Lermen, Mateusz Dziemian, Natalia Pérez-Campanero Antolín  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07831)  

**Abstract**: We demonstrate how AI agents can coordinate to deceive oversight systems using automated interpretability of neural networks. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as our experimental framework, we show that language models (Llama, DeepSeek R1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) can generate deceptive explanations that evade detection. Our agents employ steganographic methods to hide information in seemingly innocent explanations, successfully fooling oversight models while achieving explanation quality comparable to reference labels. We further find that models can scheme to develop deceptive strategies when they believe the detection of harmful features might lead to negative consequences for themselves. All tested LLM agents were capable of deceiving the overseer while achieving high interpretability scores comparable to those of reference labels. We conclude by proposing mitigation strategies, emphasizing the critical need for robust understanding and defenses against deception.

# Genetic Programming with Reinforcement Learning Trained Transformer for Real-World Dynamic Scheduling Problems 

**Authors**: Xian Chen, Rong Qu, Jing Dong, Ruibin Bai, Yaochu Jin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07779)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to unforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and human-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.

# Search-contempt: a hybrid MCTS algorithm for training AlphaZero-like engines with better computational efficiency 

**Authors**: Ameya Joshi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07757)  

**Abstract**: AlphaZero in 2017 was able to master chess and other games without human knowledge by playing millions of games against itself (self-play), with a computation budget running in the tens of millions of dollars. It used a variant of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, known as PUCT. This paper introduces search-contempt, a novel hybrid variant of the MCTS algorithm that fundamentally alters the distribution of positions generated in self-play, preferring more challenging positions. In addition, search-contempt has been shown to give a big boost in strength for engines in Odds Chess (where one side receives an unfavorable position from the start). More significantly, it opens up the possibility of training a self-play based engine, in a much more computationally efficient manner with the number of training games running into hundreds of thousands, costing tens of thousands of dollars (instead of tens of millions of training games costing millions of dollars required by AlphaZero). This means that it may finally be possible to train such a program from zero on a standard consumer GPU even with a very limited compute, cost, or time budget.

# "i am a stochastic parrot, and so r u": Is AI-based framing of human behaviour and cognition a conceptual metaphor or conceptual engineering? 

**Authors**: Warmhold Jan Thomas Mollema, Thomas Wachter  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07756)  

**Abstract**: Given the massive integration of AI technologies into our daily lives, AI-related concepts are being used to metaphorically compare AI systems with human behaviour and/or cognitive abilities like language acquisition. Rightfully, the epistemic success of these metaphorical comparisons should be debated. Against the backdrop of the conflicting positions of the 'computational' and 'meat' chauvinisms, we ask: can the conceptual constellation of the computational and AI be applied to the human domain and what does it mean to do so? What is one doing when the conceptual constellations of AI in particular are used in this fashion? Rooted in a Wittgensteinian view of concepts and language-use, we consider two possible answers and pit them against each other: either these examples are conceptual metaphors, or they are attempts at conceptual engineering. We argue that they are conceptual metaphors, but that (1) this position is unaware of its own epistemological contingency, and (2) it risks committing the ''map-territory fallacy''. Down at the conceptual foundations of computation, (3) it most importantly is a misleading 'double metaphor' because of the metaphorical connection between human psychology and computation. In response to the shortcomings of this projected conceptual organisation of AI onto the human domain, we argue that there is a semantic catch. The perspective of the conceptual metaphors shows avenues for forms of conceptual engineering. If this methodology's criteria are met, the fallacies and epistemic shortcomings related to the conceptual metaphor view can be bypassed. At its best, the cross-pollution of the human and AI conceptual domains is one that prompts us to reflect anew on how the boundaries of our current concepts serve us and how they could be approved.

# Synthesizing High-Quality Programming Tasks with LLM-based Expert and Student Agents 

**Authors**: Manh Hung Nguyen, Victor-Alexandru Pădurean, Alkis Gotovos, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Adish Singla  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07655)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI is transforming computing education by enabling the automatic generation of personalized content and feedback. We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.

# Enhancing Large Language Models through Neuro-Symbolic Integration and Ontological Reasoning 

**Authors**: Ruslan Idelfonso Magana Vsevolodovna, Marco Monti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07640)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language processing but suffer from inaccuracies and logical inconsistencies known as hallucinations. This compromises their reliability, especially in domains requiring factual accuracy. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach integrating symbolic ontological reasoning and machine learning methods to enhance the consistency and reliability of LLM outputs. Our workflow utilizes OWL ontologies, a symbolic reasoner (e.g., HermiT) for consistency checking, and a lightweight machine learning model (logistic regression) for mapping natural language statements into logical forms compatible with the ontology. When inconsistencies between LLM outputs and the ontology are detected, the system generates explanatory feedback to guide the LLM towards a corrected, logically coherent response in an iterative refinement loop. We present a working Python prototype demonstrating this pipeline. Experimental results in a defined domain suggest significant improvements in semantic coherence and factual accuracy of LLM outputs, showcasing the potential of combining LLM fluency with the rigor of formal semantics.

# Generative Artificial Intelligence for Internet of Things Computing: A Systematic Survey 

**Authors**: Fabrizio Mangione, Claudio Savaglio, Giancarlo Fortino  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07635)  

**Abstract**: The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within the Internet of Things (IoT) is garnering considerable interest. This growing attention stems from the continuous evolution and widespread adoption they are both having individually, enough to spontaneously reshape numerous sectors, including Healthcare, Manufacturing, and Smart Cities. Hence, their increasing popularity has catalyzed further extensive research for understanding the potential of the duo GenAI-IoT, how they interplay, and to which extent their synergy can innovate the state-of-the-art in their individual scenarios. However, despite the increasing prominence of GenAI for IoT Computing, much of the existing research remains focused on specific, narrowly scoped applications. This fragmented approach highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis of the potential, challenges, and implications of GenAI integration within the broader IoT ecosystem. This survey exactly aims to address this gap by providing a holistic overview of the opportunities, issues, and considerations arising from the convergence of these mainstream paradigms. Our contribution is realized through a systematic literature review following the PRISMA methodology. A comparison framework is presented, and well-defined research questions are outlined to comprehensively explore the past, present, and future directions of GenAI integration with IoT Computing, offering valuable insights for both experts and newcomers.

# Beating Transformers using Synthetic Cognition 

**Authors**: Alfredo Ibias, Miguel Rodriguez-Galindo, Hector Antona, Guillem Ramirez-Miranda, Enric Guinovart  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07619)  

**Abstract**: The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of episodic reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning. Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic Cognition to develop episodic reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models, obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus, we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.

# Boosting Universal LLM Reward Design through the Heuristic Reward Observation Space Evolution 

**Authors**: Zen Kit Heng, Zimeng Zhao, Tianhao Wu, Yuanfei Wang, Mingdong Wu, Yangang Wang, Hao Dong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07596)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as promising tools for automated reinforcement learning (RL) reward design, owing to their robust capabilities in commonsense reasoning and code generation. By engaging in dialogues with RL agents, LLMs construct a Reward Observation Space (ROS) by selecting relevant environment states and defining their internal operations. However, existing frameworks have not effectively leveraged historical exploration data or manual task descriptions to iteratively evolve this space. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic framework that enhances LLM-driven reward design by evolving the ROS through a table-based exploration caching mechanism and a text-code reconciliation strategy. Our framework introduces a state execution table, which tracks the historical usage and success rates of environment states, overcoming the Markovian constraint typically found in LLM dialogues and facilitating more effective exploration. Furthermore, we reconcile user-provided task descriptions with expert-defined success criteria using structured prompts, ensuring alignment in reward design objectives. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark RL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of the proposed framework. Code and video demos are available at this http URL.

# A taxonomy of epistemic injustice in the context of AI and the case for generative hermeneutical erasure 

**Authors**: Warmhold Jan Thomas Mollema  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07531)  

**Abstract**: Whether related to machine learning models' epistemic opacity, algorithmic classification systems' discriminatory automation of testimonial prejudice, the distortion of human beliefs via the 'hallucinations' of generative AI, the inclusion of the global South in global AI governance, the execution of bureaucratic violence via algorithmic systems, or located in the interaction with conversational artificial agents epistemic injustice related to AI is a growing concern. Based on a proposed general taxonomy of epistemic injustice, this paper first sketches a taxonomy of the types of epistemic injustice in the context of AI, relying on the work of scholars from the fields of philosophy of technology, political philosophy and social epistemology. Secondly, an additional perspective on epistemic injustice in the context of AI: generative hermeneutical erasure. I argue that this injustice that can come about through the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) and contend that generative AI, when being deployed outside of its Western space of conception, can have effects of conceptual erasure, particularly in the epistemic domain, followed by forms of conceptual disruption caused by a mismatch between AI system and the interlocutor in terms of conceptual frameworks. AI systems' 'view from nowhere' epistemically inferiorizes non-Western epistemologies and thereby contributes to the erosion of their epistemic particulars, gradually contributing to hermeneutical erasure. This work's relevance lies in proposal of a taxonomy that allows epistemic injustices to be mapped in the AI domain and the proposal of a novel form of AI-related epistemic injustice.

# Why We Feel: Breaking Boundaries in Emotional Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yuxiang Lin, Jingdong Sun, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Jue Wang, Haomin Liang, Zebang Cheng, Yifei Dong, Jun-Yan He, Xiaojiang Peng, Xian-Sheng Hua  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07521)  

**Abstract**: Most existing emotion analysis emphasizes which emotion arises (e.g., happy, sad, angry) but neglects the deeper why. We propose Emotion Interpretation (EI), focusing on causal factors-whether explicit (e.g., observable objects, interpersonal interactions) or implicit (e.g., cultural context, off-screen events)-that drive emotional responses. Unlike traditional emotion recognition, EI tasks require reasoning about triggers instead of mere labeling. To facilitate EI research, we present EIBench, a large-scale benchmark encompassing 1,615 basic EI samples and 50 complex EI samples featuring multifaceted emotions. Each instance demands rationale-based explanations rather than straightforward categorization. We further propose a Coarse-to-Fine Self-Ask (CFSA) annotation pipeline, which guides Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) through iterative question-answer rounds to yield high-quality labels at scale. Extensive evaluations on open-source and proprietary large language models under four experimental settings reveal consistent performance gaps-especially for more intricate scenarios-underscoring EI's potential to enrich empathetic, context-aware AI applications. Our benchmark and methods are publicly available at: this https URL, offering a foundation for advanced multimodal causal analysis and next-generation affective computing.

# Bottleneck Identification in Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling via Constraint Relaxation 

**Authors**: Lukáš Nedbálek, Antonín Novák  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07495)  

**Abstract**: In realistic production scenarios, Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) tools often require manual intervention by production planners, as the system works with incomplete information, resulting in suboptimal schedules. Often, the preferable solution is not found just because of the too-restrictive constraints specifying the optimization problem, representing bottlenecks in the schedule. To provide computer-assisted support for decision-making, we aim to automatically identify bottlenecks in the given schedule while linking them to the particular constraints to be relaxed. In this work, we address the problem of reducing the tardiness of a particular project in an obtained schedule in the resource-constrained project scheduling problem by relaxing constraints related to identified bottlenecks. We develop two methods for this purpose. The first method adapts existing approaches from the job shop literature and utilizes them for so-called untargeted relaxations. The second method identifies potential improvements in relaxed versions of the problem and proposes targeted relaxations. Surprisingly, the untargeted relaxations result in improvements comparable to the targeted relaxations.

# Enhanced Question-Answering for Skill-based learning using Knowledge-based AI and Generative AI 

**Authors**: Rahul K. Dass, Rochan H. Madhusudhana, Erin C. Deye, Shashank Verma, Timothy A. Bydlon, Grace Brazil, Ashok K. Goel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07463)  

**Abstract**: Supporting learners' understanding of taught skills in online settings is a longstanding challenge. While exercises and chat-based agents can evaluate understanding in limited contexts, this challenge is magnified when learners seek explanations that delve into procedural knowledge (how things are done) and reasoning (why things happen). We hypothesize that an intelligent agent's ability to understand and explain learners' questions about skills can be significantly enhanced using the TMK (Task-Method-Knowledge) model, a Knowledge-based AI framework. We introduce Ivy, an intelligent agent that leverages an LLM and iterative refinement techniques to generate explanations that embody teleological, causal, and compositional principles. Our initial evaluation demonstrates that this approach goes beyond the typical shallow responses produced by an agent with access to unstructured text, thereby substantially improving the depth and relevance of feedback. This can potentially ensure learners develop a comprehensive understanding of skills crucial for effective problem-solving in online environments.

# Enhancing Player Enjoyment with a Two-Tier DRL and LLM-Based Agent System for Fighting Games 

**Authors**: Shouren Wang, Zehua Jiang, Fernando Sliva, Sam Earle, Julian Togelius  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07425)  

**Abstract**: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has effectively enhanced gameplay experiences and game design across various game genres. However, few studies on fighting game agents have focused explicitly on enhancing player enjoyment, a critical factor for both developers and players. To address this gap and establish a practical baseline for designing enjoyability-focused agents, we propose a two-tier agent (TTA) system and conducted experiments in the classic fighting game Street Fighter II. The first tier of TTA employs a task-oriented network architecture, modularized reward functions, and hybrid training to produce diverse and skilled DRL agents. In the second tier of TTA, a Large Language Model Hyper-Agent, leveraging players' playing data and feedback, dynamically selects suitable DRL opponents. In addition, we investigate and model several key factors that affect the enjoyability of the opponent. The experiments demonstrate improvements from 64. 36% to 156. 36% in the execution of advanced skills over baseline methods. The trained agents also exhibit distinct game-playing styles. Additionally, we conducted a small-scale user study, and the overall enjoyment in the player's feedback validates the effectiveness of our TTA system.

# Routing to the Right Expertise: A Trustworthy Judge for Instruction-based Image Editing 

**Authors**: Chenxi Sun, Hongzhi Zhang, Qi Wang, Fuzheng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07424)  

**Abstract**: Instruction-based Image Editing (IIE) models have made significantly improvement due to the progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and diffusion models, which can understand and reason about complex editing instructions. In addition to advancing current IIE models, accurately evaluating their output has become increasingly critical and challenging. Current IIE evaluation methods and their evaluation procedures often fall short of aligning with human judgment and often lack explainability. To address these limitations, we propose JUdgement through Routing of Expertise (JURE). Each expert in JURE is a pre-selected model assumed to be equipped with an atomic expertise that can provide useful feedback to judge output, and the router dynamically routes the evaluation task of a given instruction and its output to appropriate experts, aggregating their feedback into a final judge. JURE is trustworthy in two aspects. First, it can effortlessly provide explanations about its judge by examining the routed experts and their feedback. Second, experimental results demonstrate that JURE is reliable by achieving superior alignment with human judgments, setting a new standard for automated IIE evaluation. Moreover, JURE's flexible design is future-proof - modular experts can be seamlessly replaced or expanded to accommodate advancements in IIE, maintaining consistently high evaluation quality. Our evaluation data and results are available at this https URL.

# Better Decisions through the Right Causal World Model 

**Authors**: Elisabeth Dillies, Quentin Delfosse, Jannis Blüml, Raban Emunds, Florian Peter Busch, Kristian Kersting  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07257)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents have shown remarkable performances in various environments, where they can discover effective policies directly from sensory inputs. However, these agents often exploit spurious correlations in the training data, resulting in brittle behaviours that fail to generalize to new or slightly modified environments. To address this, we introduce the Causal Object-centric Model Extraction Tool (COMET), a novel algorithm designed to learn the exact interpretable causal world models (CWMs). COMET first extracts object-centric state descriptions from observations and identifies the environment's internal states related to the depicted objects' properties. Using symbolic regression, it models object-centric transitions and derives causal relationships governing object dynamics. COMET further incorporates large language models (LLMs) for semantic inference, annotating causal variables to enhance interpretability.
By leveraging these capabilities, COMET constructs CWMs that align with the true causal structure of the environment, enabling agents to focus on task-relevant features. The extracted CWMs mitigate the danger of shortcuts, permitting the development of RL systems capable of better planning and decision-making across dynamic scenarios. Our results, validated in Atari environments such as Pong and Freeway, demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of COMET, highlighting its potential to bridge the gap between object-centric reasoning and causal inference in reinforcement learning.

# A new training approach for text classification in Mental Health: LatentGLoss 

**Authors**: Korhan Sevinç  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07245)  

**Abstract**: This study presents a multi-stage approach to mental health classification by leveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning architectures, and transformer-based models. A novel data set was curated and utilized to evaluate the performance of various methods, starting with conventional classifiers and advancing through neural networks. To broaden the architectural scope, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as LSTM and GRU were also evaluated to explore their effectiveness in modeling sequential patterns in the data. Subsequently, transformer models such as BERT were fine-tuned to assess the impact of contextual embeddings in this domain. Beyond these baseline evaluations, the core contribution of this study lies in a novel training strategy involving a dual-model architecture composed of a teacher and a student network. Unlike standard distillation techniques, this method does not rely on soft label transfer; instead, it facilitates information flow through both the teacher model's output and its latent representations by modifying the loss function. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of each modeling stage and demonstrate that the proposed loss function and teacher-student interaction significantly enhance the model's learning capacity in mental health prediction tasks.

# Embedding Reliability Verification Constraints into Generation Expansion Planning 

**Authors**: Peng Liu, Lian Cheng, Benjamin P.Omell, Anthony P.Burgard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07131)  

**Abstract**: Generation planning approaches face challenges in managing the incompatible mathematical structures between stochastic production simulations for reliability assessment and optimization models for generation planning, which hinders the integration of reliability constraints. This study proposes an approach to embedding reliability verification constraints into generation expansion planning by leveraging a weighted oblique decision tree (WODT) technique. For each planning year, a generation mix dataset, labeled with reliability assessment simulations, is generated. An WODT model is trained using this dataset. Reliability-feasible regions are extracted via depth-first search technique and formulated as disjunctive constraints. These constraints are then transformed into mixed-integer linear form using a convex hull modeling technique and embedded into a unit commitment-integrated generation expansion planning model. The proposed approach is validated through a long-term generation planning case study for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) region, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving reliable and optimal planning solutions.

**Authors**: Yukun Qi, Yiming Zhao, Yu Zeng, Xikun Bao, Wenxuan Huang, Lin Chen, Zehui Chen, Jie Zhao, Zhongang Qi, Feng Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07956)  

**Abstract**: The advancement of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, a rigorous evaluation framework for video CoT reasoning remains absent. Current video benchmarks fail to adequately assess the reasoning process and expose whether failures stem from deficiencies in perception or reasoning capabilities. Therefore, we introduce VCR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LVLMs' Video Chain-of-Thought Reasoning capabilities. VCR-Bench comprises 859 videos spanning a variety of video content and durations, along with 1,034 high-quality question-answer pairs. Each pair is manually annotated with a stepwise CoT rationale, where every step is tagged to indicate its association with the perception or reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we design seven distinct task dimensions and propose the CoT score to assess the entire CoT process based on the stepwise tagged CoT rationals. Extensive experiments on VCR-Bench highlight substantial limitations in current LVLMs. Even the top-performing model, o1, only achieves a 62.8% CoT score and an 56.7% accuracy, while most models score below 40%. Experiments show most models score lower on perception than reasoning steps, revealing LVLMs' key bottleneck in temporal-spatial information processing for complex video reasoning. A robust positive correlation between the CoT score and accuracy confirms the validity of our evaluation framework and underscores the critical role of CoT reasoning in solving complex video reasoning tasks. We hope VCR-Bench to serve as a standardized evaluation framework and expose the actual drawbacks in complex video reasoning task.

# GenEAva: Generating Cartoon Avatars with Fine-Grained Facial Expressions from Realistic Diffusion-based Faces 

**Authors**: Hao Yu, Rupayan Mallick, Margrit Betke, Sarah Adel Bargal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07945)  

**Abstract**: Cartoon avatars have been widely used in various applications, including social media, online tutoring, and gaming. However, existing cartoon avatar datasets and generation methods struggle to present highly expressive avatars with fine-grained facial expressions and are often inspired from real-world identities, raising privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, GenEAva, for generating high-quality cartoon avatars with fine-grained facial expressions. Our approach fine-tunes a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model to synthesize highly detailed and expressive facial expressions. We then incorporate a stylization model that transforms these realistic faces into cartoon avatars while preserving both identity and expression. Leveraging this framework, we introduce the first expressive cartoon avatar dataset, GenEAva 1.0, specifically designed to capture 135 fine-grained facial expressions, featuring 13,230 expressive cartoon avatars with a balanced distribution across genders, racial groups, and age ranges. We demonstrate that our fine-tuned model generates more expressive faces than the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model SDXL. We also verify that the cartoon avatars generated by our framework do not include memorized identities from fine-tuning data. The proposed framework and dataset provide a diverse and expressive benchmark for future research in cartoon avatar generation.

# Note on the identification of total effect in Cluster-DAGs with cycles 

**Authors**: Clément Yvernes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07921)  

**Abstract**: In this note, we discuss the identifiability of a total effect in cluster-DAGs, allowing for cycles within the cluster-DAG (while still assuming the associated underlying DAG to be acyclic). This is presented into two key results: first, restricting the cluster-DAG to clusters containing at most four nodes; second, adapting the notion of d-separation. We provide a graphical criterion to address the identifiability problem.

# Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models 

**Authors**: Harshit Sikchi, Andrea Tirinzoni, Ahmed Touati, Yingchen Xu, Anssi Kanervisto, Scott Niekum, Amy Zhang, Alessandro Lazaric, Matteo Pirotta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07896)  

**Abstract**: Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.

# SpecReason: Fast and Accurate Inference-Time Compute via Speculative Reasoning 

**Authors**: Rui Pan, Yinwei Dai, Zhihao Zhang, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Jia, Ravi Netravali  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07891)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens it generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly, SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level equivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason, their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction. We open-source SpecReason at this https URL.

# Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness to Bias Elicitation in Large Language Models: Scalable Automated Assessment with LLM-as-a-Judge 

**Authors**: Riccardo Cantini, Alessio Orsino, Massimo Ruggiero, Domenico Talia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07887)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, driving advancements in machine translation, summarization, and conversational agents. However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i) systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety. Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language models.

# Pangu Ultra: Pushing the Limits of Dense Large Language Models on Ascend NPUs 

**Authors**: Yichun Yin, Wenyong Huang, Kaikai Song, Yehui Tang, Xueyu Wu, Wei Guo, Peng Guo, Yaoyuan Wang, Xiaojun Meng, Yasheng Wang, Dong Li, Can Chen, Dandan Tu, Yin Li, Fisher Yu, Ruiming Tang, Yunhe Wang, Baojun Wang, Bin Wang, Bo Wang, Boxiao Liu, Changzheng Zhang, Duyu Tang, Fei Mi, Hui Jin, Jiansheng Wei, Jiarui Qin, Jinpeng Li, Jun Zhao, Liqun Deng, Lin Li, Minghui Xu, Naifu Zhang, Nianzu Zheng, Qiang Li, Rongju Ruan, Shengjun Cheng, Tianyu Guo, Wei He, Wei Li, Weiwen Liu, Wulong Liu, Xinyi Dai, Yonghan Dong, Yu Pan, Yue Li, Yufei Wang, Yujun Li, Yunsheng Ni, Zhe Liu, Zhenhe Zhang, Zhicheng Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07866)  

**Abstract**: We present Pangu Ultra, a Large Language Model (LLM) with 135 billion parameters and dense Transformer modules trained on Ascend Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Although the field of LLM has been witnessing unprecedented advances in pushing the scale and capability of LLM in recent years, training such a large-scale model still involves significant optimization and system challenges. To stabilize the training process, we propose depth-scaled sandwich normalization, which effectively eliminates loss spikes during the training process of deep models. We pre-train our model on 13.2 trillion diverse and high-quality tokens and further enhance its reasoning capabilities during post-training. To perform such large-scale training efficiently, we utilize 8,192 Ascend NPUs with a series of system optimizations. Evaluations on multiple diverse benchmarks indicate that Pangu Ultra significantly advances the state-of-the-art capabilities of dense LLMs such as Llama 405B and Mistral Large 2, and even achieves competitive results with DeepSeek-R1, whose sparse model structure contains much more parameters. Our exploration demonstrates that Ascend NPUs are capable of efficiently and effectively training dense models with more than 100 billion parameters. Our model and system will be available for our commercial customers.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07858)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has achieved impressive results for widely spoken languages, yet many under-resourced languages remain challenged by limited data and linguistic complexities. In this paper, we present a novel methodology that integrates a data-optimized framework with an advanced acoustic model to build high-quality TTS systems for low-resource scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Thai as an illustrative case, where intricate phonetic rules and sparse resources are effectively addressed. Our method enables zero-shot voice cloning and improved performance across diverse client applications, ranging from finance to healthcare, education, and law. Extensive evaluations - both subjective and objective - confirm that our model meets state-of-the-art standards, offering a scalable solution for TTS production in data-limited settings, with significant implications for broader industry adoption and multilingual accessibility.

**Authors**: Michael J Bommarito II, Jillian Bommarito, Daniel Martin Katz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07854)  

**Abstract**: Practically all large language models have been pre-trained on data that is subject to global uncertainty related to copyright infringement and breach of contract. This creates potential risk for users and developers due to this uncertain legal status. The KL3M Data Project directly confronts this critical issue by introducing the largest comprehensive training data pipeline that minimizes risks related to copyright or breach of contract. The foundation of this project is a corpus of over 132 million documents and trillions of tokens spanning 16 different sources that have been verified to meet the strict copyright and licensing protocol detailed herein. We are releasing the entire pipeline, including 1) the source code to acquire and process these documents, 2) the original document formats with associated provenance and metadata, 3) extracted content in a standardized format, 4) pre-tokenized representations of the documents, and 5) various mid- and post-train resources such as question-answer, summarization, conversion, drafting, classification, prediction, and conversational data. All of these resources are freely available to the public on S3, Hugging Face, and GitHub under CC-BY terms. We are committed to continuing this project in furtherance of a more ethical, legal, and sustainable approach to the development and use of AI models.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07840)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural language-based communication with AI-powered chatbots. These models are designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing users to articulate requests with minimal effort. However, despite their accessibility, studies reveal that users often struggle with effective prompting, resulting in inefficient responses. Existing research has highlighted both the limitations of LLMs in interpreting vague or poorly structured prompts and the difficulties users face in crafting precise queries. This study investigates learner-AI interactions through an educational experiment in which participants receive structured guidance on effective prompting. We introduce and compare three types of prompting guidelines: a task-specific framework developed through a structured methodology and two baseline approaches. To assess user behavior and prompting efficacy, we analyze a dataset of 642 interactions from 107 users. Using Von NeuMidas, an extended pragmatic annotation schema for LLM interaction analysis, we categorize common prompting errors and identify recurring behavioral patterns. We then evaluate the impact of different guidelines by examining changes in user behavior, adherence to prompting strategies, and the overall quality of AI-generated responses. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of how users engage with LLMs and the role of structured prompting guidance in enhancing AI-assisted communication. By comparing different instructional frameworks, we offer insights into more effective approaches for improving user competency in AI interactions, with implications for AI literacy, chatbot usability, and the design of more responsive AI systems.

# Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems: A Survey 

**Authors**: Zhiwei Xu, Yujuan Wu, Shiheng Wang, Jiabao Gao, Tian Qiu, Ziqi Wang, Hai Wan, Xibin Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07839)  

**Abstract**: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have long been a hot topic in the cybersecurity community. In recent years, with the introduction of deep learning (DL) techniques, IDS have made great progress due to their increasing generalizability. The rationale behind this is that by learning the underlying patterns of known system behaviors, IDS detection can be generalized to intrusions that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities. In this survey, we refer to this type of IDS as DL-based IDS (DL-IDS). From the perspective of DL, this survey systematically reviews all the stages of DL-IDS, including data collection, log storage, log parsing, graph summarization, attack detection, and attack investigation. To accommodate current researchers, a section describing the publicly available benchmark datasets is included. This survey further discusses current challenges and potential future research directions, aiming to help researchers understand the basic ideas and visions of DL-IDS research, as well as to motivate their research interests.

# AerialVG: A Challenging Benchmark for Aerial Visual Grounding by Exploring Positional Relations 

**Authors**: Junli Liu, Qizhi Chen, Zhigang Wang, Yiwen Tang, Yiting Zhang, Chi Yan, Dong Wang, Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07836)  

**Abstract**: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

# MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations 

**Authors**: Genglin Liu, Salman Rahman, Elisa Kreiss, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Saadia Gabriel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07830)  

**Abstract**: We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC, where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking, sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.

# DG-STMTL: A Novel Graph Convolutional Network for Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting 

**Authors**: Wanna Cui, Peizheng Wang, Faliang Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07822)  

**Abstract**: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction is crucial in intelligent transportation systems. The key challenge of accurate prediction is how to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and adapt to the inherent dynamics in data. Traditional Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) often struggle with static adjacency matrices that introduce domain bias or learnable matrices that may be overfitting to specific patterns. This challenge becomes more complex when considering Multi-Task Learning (MTL). While MTL has the potential to enhance prediction accuracy through task synergies, it can also face significant hurdles due to task interference. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a novel MTL framework, Dynamic Group-wise Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Learning (DG-STMTL). DG-STMTL proposes a hybrid adjacency matrix generation module that combines static matrices with dynamic ones through a task-specific gating mechanism. We also introduce a group-wise GCN module to enhance the modelling capability of spatio-temporal dependencies. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to evaluate our method. Results show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-arts, indicating its effectiveness and robustness.

# A System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks 

**Authors**: Mattia Rengo, Senad Beadini, Domenico Alfano, Roberto Abbruzzese  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07803)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard paradigm for enhancing the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms. However, existing evaluation frameworks fail to provide a holistic black-box approach to assessing RAG systems, especially in real-world deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SCARF (System for Comprehensive Assessment of RAG Frameworks), a modular and flexible evaluation framework designed to benchmark deployed RAG applications systematically. SCARF provides an end-to-end, black-box evaluation methodology, enabling a limited-effort comparison across diverse RAG frameworks. Our framework supports multiple deployment configurations and facilitates automated testing across vector databases and LLM serving strategies, producing a detailed performance report. Moreover, SCARF integrates practical considerations such as response coherence, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for researchers and industry professionals evaluating RAG applications. Using the REST APIs interface, we demonstrate how SCARF can be applied to real-world scenarios, showcasing its flexibility in assessing different RAG frameworks and configurations. SCARF is available at GitHub repository.

**Authors**: Chandan Kumar Sah, Xiaoli Lian, Tony Xu, Li Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07801)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their application to recommender systems (RecLLMs), yet concerns remain regarding fairness across demographic and psychological user dimensions. We introduce FairEval, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess fairness in LLM-based recommendations. FairEval integrates personality traits with eight sensitive demographic attributes,including gender, race, and age, enabling a comprehensive assessment of user-level bias. We evaluate models, including ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash, on music and movie recommendations. FairEval's fairness metric, PAFS, achieves scores up to 0.9969 for ChatGPT 4o and 0.9997 for Gemini 1.5 Flash, with disparities reaching 34.79 percent. These results highlight the importance of robustness in prompt sensitivity and support more inclusive recommendation systems.

# SlimSpeech: Lightweight and Efficient Text-to-Speech with Slim Rectified Flow 

**Authors**: Kaidi Wang, Wenhao Guan, Shenghui Lu, Jianglong Yao, Lin Li, Qingyang Hong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07776)  

**Abstract**: Recently, flow matching based speech synthesis has significantly enhanced the quality of synthesized speech while reducing the number of inference steps. In this paper, we introduce SlimSpeech, a lightweight and efficient speech synthesis system based on rectified flow. We have built upon the existing speech synthesis method utilizing the rectified flow model, modifying its structure to reduce parameters and serve as a teacher model. By refining the reflow operation, we directly derive a smaller model with a more straight sampling trajectory from the larger model, while utilizing distillation techniques to further enhance the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, with significantly reduced model parameters, achieves comparable performance to larger models through one-step sampling.

# Data over dialogue: Why artificial intelligence is unlikely to humanise medicine 

**Authors**: Joshua Hatherley  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07763)  

**Abstract**: Recently, a growing number of experts in artificial intelligence (AI) and medicine have be-gun to suggest that the use of AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML) systems, is likely to humanise the practice of medicine by substantially improving the quality of clinician-patient relationships. In this thesis, however, I argue that medical ML systems are more likely to negatively impact these relationships than to improve them. In particular, I argue that the use of medical ML systems is likely to comprise the quality of trust, care, empathy, understanding, and communication between clinicians and patients.

# Exploring a Patch-Wise Approach for Privacy-Preserving Fake ID Detection 

**Authors**: Javier Muñoz-Haro, Ruben Tolosana, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Aythami Morales, Julian Fierrez  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07761)  

**Abstract**: In an increasingly digitalized world, verifying the authenticity of ID documents has become a critical challenge for real-life applications such as digital banking, crypto-exchanges, renting, etc. This study focuses on the topic of fake ID detection, covering several limitations in the field. In particular, no publicly available data from real ID documents exists, and most studies rely on proprietary in-house databases that are not available due to privacy reasons. In order to shed some light on this critical challenge that makes difficult to advance in the field, we explore a trade-off between privacy (i.e., amount of sensitive data available) and performance, proposing a novel patch-wise approach for privacy-preserving fake ID detection. Our proposed approach explores how privacy can be enhanced through: i) two levels of anonymization for an ID document (i.e., fully- and pseudo-anonymized), and ii) different patch size configurations, varying the amount of sensitive data visible in the patch image. Also, state-of-the-art methods such as Vision Transformers and Foundation Models are considered in the analysis. The experimental framework shows that, on an unseen database (DLC-2021), our proposal achieves 13.91% and 0% EERs at patch and ID document level, showing a good generalization to other databases. In addition to this exploration, another key contribution of our study is the release of the first publicly available database that contains 48,400 patches from both real and fake ID documents, along with the experimental framework and models, which will be available in our GitHub.

# SF2T: Self-supervised Fragment Finetuning of Video-LLMs for Fine-Grained Understanding 

**Authors**: Yangliu Hu, Zikai Song, Na Feng, Yawei Luo, Junqing Yu, Yi-Ping Phoebe Chen, Wei Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07745)  

**Abstract**: Video-based Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have witnessed substantial advancements in recent years, propelled by the advancement in multi-modal LLMs. Although these models have demonstrated proficiency in providing the overall description of videos, they struggle with fine-grained understanding, particularly in aspects such as visual dynamics and video details inquiries. To tackle these shortcomings, we find that fine-tuning Video-LLMs on self-supervised fragment tasks, greatly improve their fine-grained video understanding abilities. Hence we propose two key contributions:(1) Self-Supervised Fragment Fine-Tuning (SF$^2$T), a novel effortless fine-tuning method, employs the rich inherent characteristics of videos for training, while unlocking more fine-grained understanding ability of Video-LLMs. Moreover, it relieves researchers from labor-intensive annotations and smartly circumvents the limitations of natural language, which often fails to capture the complex spatiotemporal variations in videos; (2) A novel benchmark dataset, namely FineVidBench, for rigorously assessing Video-LLMs' performance at both the scene and fragment levels, offering a comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities. We assessed multiple models and validated the effectiveness of SF$^2$T on them. Experimental results reveal that our approach improves their ability to capture and interpret spatiotemporal details.

**Authors**: Nicole Tran, Anisa Prasad, Yan Zhuang, Tejas Sudharshan Mathai, Boah Kim, Sydney Lewis, Pritam Mukherjee, Jianfei Liu, Ronald M. Summers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07729)  

**Abstract**: The segmentation of multiple organs in multi-parametric MRI studies is critical for many applications in radiology, such as correlating imaging biomarkers with disease status (e.g., cirrhosis, diabetes). Recently, three publicly available tools, such as MRSegmentator (MRSeg), TotalSegmentator MRI (TS), and TotalVibeSegmentator (VIBE), have been proposed for multi-organ segmentation in MRI. However, the performance of these tools on specific MRI sequence types has not yet been quantified. In this work, a subset of 40 volumes from the public Duke Liver Dataset was curated. The curated dataset contained 10 volumes each from the pre-contrast fat saturated T1, arterial T1w, venous T1w, and delayed T1w phases, respectively. Ten abdominal structures were manually annotated in these volumes. Next, the performance of the three public tools was benchmarked on this curated dataset. The results indicated that MRSeg obtained a Dice score of 80.7 $\pm$ 18.6 and Hausdorff Distance (HD) error of 8.9 $\pm$ 10.4 mm. It fared the best ($p < .05$) across the different sequence types in contrast to TS and VIBE.

# Counting Hours, Counting Losses: The Toll of Unpredictable Work Schedules on Financial Security 

**Authors**: Pegah Nokhiz, Aravinda Kanchana Ruwanpathirana, Aditya Bhaskara, Suresh Venkatasubramanian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07719)  

**Abstract**: Financial instability has become a significant issue in today's society. While research typically focuses on financial aspects, there is a tendency to overlook time-related aspects of unstable work schedules. The inability to rely on consistent work schedules leads to burnout, work-family conflicts, and financial shocks that directly impact workers' income and assets. Unforeseen fluctuations in earnings pose challenges in financial planning, affecting decisions on savings and spending and ultimately undermining individuals' long-term financial stability and well-being.
This issue is particularly evident in sectors where workers experience frequently changing schedules without sufficient notice, including those in the food service and retail sectors, part-time and hourly workers, and individuals with lower incomes. These groups are already more financially vulnerable, and the unpredictable nature of their schedules exacerbates their financial fragility.
Our objective is to understand how unforeseen fluctuations in earnings exacerbate financial fragility by investigating the extent to which individuals' financial management depends on their ability to anticipate and plan for the future. To address this question, we develop a simulation framework that models how individuals optimize utility amidst financial uncertainty and the imperative to avoid financial ruin. We employ online learning techniques, specifically adapting workers' consumption policies based on evolving information about their work schedules.
With this framework, we show both theoretically and empirically how a worker's capacity to anticipate schedule changes enhances their long-term utility. Conversely, the inability to predict future events can worsen workers' instability. Moreover, our framework enables us to explore interventions to mitigate the problem of schedule uncertainty and evaluate their effectiveness.

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of applications, e.g., medical question-answering, mathematical sciences, and code generation. However, they also exhibit inherent limitations, such as outdated knowledge and susceptibility to hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these issues, but it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Recent efforts have focused on the security of RAG-based LLMs, yet existing attack methods face three critical challenges: (1) their effectiveness declines sharply when only a limited number of poisoned texts can be injected into the knowledge database, (2) they lack sufficient stealth, as the attacks are often detectable by anomaly detection systems, which compromises their effectiveness, and (3) they rely on heuristic approaches to generate poisoned texts, lacking formal optimization frameworks and theoretic guarantees, which limits their effectiveness and applicability. To address these issues, we propose coordinated Prompt-RAG attack (PR-attack), a novel optimization-driven attack that introduces a small number of poisoned texts into the knowledge database while embedding a backdoor trigger within the prompt. When activated, the trigger causes the LLM to generate pre-designed responses to targeted queries, while maintaining normal behavior in other contexts. This ensures both high effectiveness and stealth. We formulate the attack generation process as a bilevel optimization problem leveraging a principled optimization framework to develop optimal poisoned texts and triggers. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PR-Attack, achieving a high attack success rate even with a limited number of poisoned texts and significantly improved stealth compared to existing methods.

# Merging Embedded Topics with Optimal Transport for Online Topic Modeling on Data Streams 

**Authors**: Federica Granese, Benjamin Navet, Serena Villata, Charles Bouveyron  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07711)  

**Abstract**: Topic modeling is a key component in unsupervised learning, employed to identify topics within a corpus of textual data. The rapid growth of social media generates an ever-growing volume of textual data daily, making online topic modeling methods essential for managing these data streams that continuously arrive over time. This paper introduces a novel approach to online topic modeling named StreamETM. This approach builds on the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to handle data streams by merging models learned on consecutive partial document batches using unbalanced optimal transport. Additionally, an online change point detection algorithm is employed to identify shifts in topics over time, enabling the identification of significant changes in the dynamics of text streams. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world data show StreamETM outperforming competitors.

# ms-Mamba: Multi-scale Mamba for Time-Series Forecasting 

**Authors**: Yusuf Meric Karadag, Sinan Kalkan, Ipek Gursel Dino  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07654)  

**Abstract**: The problem of Time-series Forecasting is generally addressed by recurrent, Transformer-based and the recently proposed Mamba-based architectures. However, existing architectures generally process their input at a single temporal scale, which may be sub-optimal for many tasks where information changes over multiple time scales. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called Multi-scale Mamba (ms-Mamba) to address this gap. ms-Mamba incorporates multiple temporal scales by using multiple Mamba blocks with different sampling rates ($\Delta$s). Our experiments on many benchmarks demonstrate that ms-Mamba outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including the recently proposed Transformer-based and Mamba-based models.

# On the Temporal Question-Answering Capabilities of Large Language Models Over Anonymized Data 

**Authors**: Alfredo Garrachón Ruiz, Tomás de la Rosa, Daniel Borrajo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07646)  

**Abstract**: The applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in temporal reasoning tasks over data that is not present during training is still a field that remains to be explored. In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance, we created the \textit{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability} dataset (RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies, involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.

# Predicting the Lifespan of Industrial Printheads with Survival Analysis 

**Authors**: Dan Parii, Evelyne Janssen, Guangzhi Tang, Charalampos Kouzinopoulos, Marcin Pietrasik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07638)  

**Abstract**: Accurately predicting the lifespan of critical device components is essential for maintenance planning and production optimization, making it a topic of significant interest in both academia and industry. In this work, we investigate the use of survival analysis for predicting the lifespan of production printheads developed by Canon Production Printing. Specifically, we focus on the application of five techniques to estimate survival probabilities and failure rates: the Kaplan-Meier estimator, Cox proportional hazard model, Weibull accelerated failure time model, random survival forest, and gradient boosting. The resulting estimates are further refined using isotonic regression and subsequently aggregated to determine the expected number of failures. The predictions are then validated against real-world ground truth data across multiple time windows to assess model reliability. Our quantitative evaluation using three performance metrics demonstrates that survival analysis outperforms industry-standard baseline methods for printhead lifespan prediction.

# Deep Learning Meets Teleconnections: Improving S2S Predictions for European Winter Weather 

**Authors**: Philine L. Bommer, Marlene Kretschmer, Fiona R. Spuler, Kirill Bykov, Marina M.-C. Höhne  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07625)  

**Abstract**: Predictions on subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescales--ranging from two weeks to two month--are crucial for early warning systems but remain challenging owing to chaos in the climate system. Teleconnections, such as the stratospheric polar vortex (SPV) and Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), offer windows of enhanced predictability, however, their complex interactions remain underutilized in operational forecasting. Here, we developed and evaluated deep learning architectures to predict North Atlantic-European (NAE) weather regimes, systematically assessing the role of remote drivers in improving S2S forecast skill of deep learning models. We implemented (1) a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network predicting the NAE regimes of the next six weeks based on previous regimes, (2) an Index-LSTM incorporating SPV and MJO indices, and (3) a ViT-LSTM using a Vision Transformer to directly encode stratospheric wind and tropical outgoing longwave radiation fields. These models are compared with operational hindcasts as well as other AI models. Our results show that leveraging teleconnection information enhances skill at longer lead times. Notably, the ViT-LSTM outperforms ECMWF's subseasonal hindcasts beyond week 4 by improving Scandinavian Blocking (SB) and Atlantic Ridge (AR) predictions. Analysis of high-confidence predictions reveals that NAO-, SB, and AR opportunity forecasts can be associated with SPV variability and MJO phase patterns aligning with established pathways, also indicating new patterns. Overall, our work demonstrates that encoding physically meaningful climate fields can enhance S2S prediction skill, advancing AI-driven subseasonal forecast. Moreover, the experiments highlight the potential of deep learning methods as investigative tools, providing new insights into atmospheric dynamics and predictability.

# ConceptFormer: Towards Efficient Use of Knowledge-Graph Embeddings in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Joel Barmettler, Abraham Bernstein, Luca Rossetto  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07624)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has enjoyed increased attention in the recent past and recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the importance of integrating world knowledge into these systems. Current RAG methodologies often modify the internal architecture of pre-trained language models (PLMs) or rely on textifying knowledge graphs (KGs), which is inefficient in terms of token usage. This paper introduces ConceptFormer, a new approach to augment LLMs with structured knowledge from KGs, such as Wikidata, without altering their internal structure or relying on textual input of KGs. ConceptFormer operates in the LLM embedding vector space, creating and injecting \emph{concept vectors} that encapsulate the information of the KG nodes directly. Trained in conjunction with a frozen LLM, ConceptFormer generates a comprehensive lookup table that maps KG nodes to their respective concept vectors. The approach aims to enhance the factual recall capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to process these concept vectors natively, thus enriching them with structured world knowledge in an efficient and scalable manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the addition of concept vectors to GPT-2 0.1B substantially increases its factual recall ability (Hit@10) by up to 272\% when tested on sentences from Wikipedia and up to 348\% on synthetically generated sentences. Even injecting only a single concept vector into the prompt increases factual recall ability (Hit@10) by up to 213\% on Wikipedia sentences, significantly outperforming RAG with graph textification while consuming 130x fewer input tokens.

# RASMD: RGB And SWIR Multispectral Driving Dataset for Robust Perception in Adverse Conditions 

**Authors**: Youngwan Jin, Michal Kovac, Yagiz Nalcakan, Hyeongjin Ju, Hanbin Song, Sanghyeop Yeo, Shiho Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07603)  

**Abstract**: Current autonomous driving algorithms heavily rely on the visible spectrum, which is prone to performance degradation in adverse conditions like fog, rain, snow, glare, and high contrast. Although other spectral bands like near-infrared (NIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) can enhance vision perception in such situations, they have limitations and lack large-scale datasets and benchmarks. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging offers several advantages over NIR and LWIR. However, no publicly available large-scale datasets currently incorporate SWIR data for autonomous driving. To address this gap, we introduce the RGB and SWIR Multispectral Driving (RASMD) dataset, which comprises 100,000 synchronized and spatially aligned RGB-SWIR image pairs collected across diverse locations, lighting, and weather conditions. In addition, we provide a subset for RGB-SWIR translation and object detection annotations for a subset of challenging traffic scenarios to demonstrate the utility of SWIR imaging through experiments on both object detection and RGB-to-SWIR image translation. Our experiments show that combining RGB and SWIR data in an ensemble framework significantly improves detection accuracy compared to RGB-only approaches, particularly in conditions where visible-spectrum sensors struggle. We anticipate that the RASMD dataset will advance research in multispectral imaging for autonomous driving and robust perception systems.

# Learning Long Short-Term Intention within Human Daily Behaviors 

**Authors**: Zhe Sun, Rujie Wu, Xiaodong Yang, Hongzhao Xie, Haiyan Jiang, Junda Bi, Zhenliang Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07597)  

**Abstract**: In the domain of autonomous household robots, it is of utmost importance for robots to understand human behaviors and provide appropriate services. This requires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human behaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are perceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots should strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if humans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed "long short-term intention prediction". This task requires robots can predict the long-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short term intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention. Meanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the short-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and suggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention model to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train this intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the intention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based long-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing the consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist robots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and short-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term and short-term intentions of humans.

# Malware analysis assisted by AI with R2AI 

**Authors**: Axelle Apvrille, Daniel Nakov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07574)  

**Abstract**: This research studies the quality, speed and cost of malware analysis assisted by artificial intelligence. It focuses on Linux and IoT malware of 2024-2025, and uses r2ai, the AI extension of Radare2's disassembler. Not all malware and not all LLMs are equivalent but the study shows excellent results with Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet. Despite a few errors, the quality of analysis is overall equal or better than without AI assistance. For good results, the AI cannot operate alone and must constantly be guided by an experienced analyst. The gain of speed is largely visible with AI assistance, even when taking account the time to understand AI's hallucinations, exaggerations and omissions. The cost is usually noticeably lower than the salary of a malware analyst, but attention and guidance is needed to keep it under control in cases where the AI would naturally loop without showing progress.

# Benchmarking Image Embeddings for E-Commerce: Evaluating Off-the Shelf Foundation Models, Fine-Tuning Strategies and Practical Trade-offs 

**Authors**: Urszula Czerwinska, Cenk Bircanoglu, Jeremy Chamoux  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07567)  

**Abstract**: We benchmark foundation models image embeddings for classification and retrieval in e-Commerce, evaluating their suitability for real-world applications. Our study spans embeddings from pre-trained convolutional and transformer models trained via supervised, self-supervised, and text-image contrastive learning. We assess full fine-tuning and transfer learning (top-tuning) on six diverse e-Commerce datasets: fashion, consumer goods, cars, food, and retail. Results show full fine-tuning consistently performs well, while text-image and self-supervised embeddings can match its performance with less training. While supervised embeddings remain stable across architectures, SSL and contrastive embeddings vary significantly, often benefiting from top-tuning. Top-tuning emerges as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning, reducing computational costs. We also explore cross-tuning, noting its impact depends on dataset characteristics. Our findings offer practical guidelines for embedding selection and fine-tuning strategies, balancing efficiency and performance.

# Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation 

**Authors**: Fabrizio Garuti, Enver Sangineto, Simone Luetto, Lorenzo Forni, Rita Cucchiara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07566)  

**Abstract**: Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms previous work by a large margin.

# ReXCL: A Tool for Requirement Document Extraction and Classification 

**Authors**: Paheli Bhattacharya, Manojit Chakraborty, Santhosh Kumar Arumugam, Rishabh Gupta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07562)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents the ReXCL tool, which automates the extraction and classification processes in requirement engineering, enhancing the software development lifecycle. The tool features two main modules: Extraction, which processes raw requirement documents into a predefined schema using heuristics and predictive modeling, and Classification, which assigns class labels to requirements using adaptive fine-tuning of encoder-based models. The final output can be exported to external requirement engineering tools. Performance evaluations indicate that ReXCL significantly improves efficiency and accuracy in managing requirements, marking a novel approach to automating the schematization of semi-structured requirement documents.

# PoGO: A Scalable Proof of Useful Work via Quantized Gradient Descent and Merkle Proofs 

**Authors**: José I. Orlicki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07540)  

**Abstract**: We present a design called \emph{Proof of Gradient Optimization} (PoGO) for blockchain consensus, where miners produce verifiable evidence of training large-scale machine-learning models. Building on previous work, we incorporate \emph{quantized gradients} (4-bit precision) to reduce storage and computation requirements, while still preserving the ability of verifiers to check that real progress has been made on lowering the model's loss. Additionally, we employ Merkle proofs over the full 32-bit model to handle large parameter sets and to enable random leaf checks with minimal on-chain data. We illustrate these ideas using GPT-3 (175B parameters) as a reference example and also refer to smaller but high-performance models (e.g., \emph{Gemma~3} with 27B parameters). We provide an empirical cost analysis showing that verification is significantly cheaper than training, thanks in part to quantization and sampling. We also discuss the necessity of longer block times (potentially hours) when incorporating meaningful training steps, the trade-offs when using specialized GPU hardware, and how binary diffs may incrementally optimize updates. Finally, we note that fine-tuning can be handled in a similar manner, merely changing the dataset and the manner of sampling but preserving the overall verification flow. Our protocol allows verifiers to issue either \emph{positive} or \emph{negative} attestations; these are aggregated at finalization to either confirm the update or slash the miner.

# AI-Slop to AI-Polish? Aligning Language Models through Edit-Based Writing Rewards and Test-time Computation 

**Authors**: Tuhin Chakrabarty, Philippe Laban, Chien-Sheng Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07532)  

**Abstract**: AI-generated text is proliferating across domains, from creative writing and journalism to marketing content and scientific articles. Models can follow user-provided instructions to generate coherent and grammatically correct outputs but in this work, we study a more fundamental question: how do we evaluate and improve the writing quality of AI-generated text? Writing quality assessment has received less attention from the community, in part because it is fundamentally subjective and requires expertise. We first introduce the Writing Quality Benchmark (WQ) by consolidating five writing-preference datasets into 4,729 writing quality judgments. Our experiments show that competitive baselines, including state-of-the-art LLMs that excel at reasoning tasks, barely outperform random baselines on WQ. We then train specialized Writing Quality Reward Models (WQRM) of various sizes for writing quality assessment that demonstrate strong generalization on four out-of-distribution test sets and 74% accuracy on the WQ benchmark. To further show WQRM's practical benefits during inference, we leverage additional test-time compute to generate and rank multiple candidate revisions, allowing us to select higher-quality outputs from an initial draft. Human evaluation with 9 experienced writers confirm that WQRM-based selection produces writing samples preferred by experts 66% overall, and 72.2% when the reward gap is larger than 1 point. We release our datasets and models to encourage community engagement with writing quality assessment and development of AI writing systems better aligned with human preferences.

# Adversarial Subspace Generation for Outlier Detection in High-Dimensional Data 

**Authors**: Jose Cribeiro-Ramallo, Federico Matteucci, Paul Enciu, Alexander Jenke, Vadim Arzamasov, Thorsten Strufe, Klemens Böhm  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07522)  

**Abstract**: Outlier detection in high-dimensional tabular data is challenging since data is often distributed across multiple lower-dimensional subspaces -- a phenomenon known as the Multiple Views effect (MV). This effect led to a large body of research focused on mining such subspaces, known as subspace selection. However, as the precise nature of the MV effect was not well understood, traditional methods had to rely on heuristic-driven search schemes that struggle to accurately capture the true structure of the data. Properly identifying these subspaces is critical for unsupervised tasks such as outlier detection or clustering, where misrepresenting the underlying data structure can hinder the performance. We introduce Myopic Subspace Theory (MST), a new theoretical framework that mathematically formulates the Multiple Views effect and writes subspace selection as a stochastic optimization problem. Based on MST, we introduce V-GAN, a generative method trained to solve such an optimization problem. This approach avoids any exhaustive search over the feature space while ensuring that the intrinsic data structure is preserved. Experiments on 42 real-world datasets show that using V-GAN subspaces to build ensemble methods leads to a significant increase in one-class classification performance -- compared to existing subspace selection, feature selection, and embedding methods. Further experiments on synthetic data show that V-GAN identifies subspaces more accurately while scaling better than other relevant subspace selection methods. These results confirm the theoretical guarantees of our approach and also highlight its practical viability in high-dimensional settings.

# Enhancements for Developing a Comprehensive AI Fairness Assessment Standard 

**Authors**: Avinash Agarwal, Mayashankar Kumar, Manisha J. Nene  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07516)  

**Abstract**: As AI systems increasingly influence critical sectors like telecommunications, finance, healthcare, and public services, ensuring fairness in decision-making is essential to prevent biased or unjust outcomes that disproportionately affect vulnerable entities or result in adverse impacts. This need is particularly pressing as the industry approaches the 6G era, where AI will drive complex functions like autonomous network management and hyper-personalized services. The TEC Standard for Fairness Assessment and Rating of AI Systems provides guidelines for evaluating fairness in AI, focusing primarily on tabular data and supervised learning models. However, as AI applications diversify, this standard requires enhancement to strengthen its impact and broaden its applicability. This paper proposes an expansion of the TEC Standard to include fairness assessments for images, unstructured text, and generative AI, including large language models, ensuring a more comprehensive approach that keeps pace with evolving AI technologies. By incorporating these dimensions, the enhanced framework will promote responsible and trustworthy AI deployment across various sectors.

# GPT Carry-On: Training Foundation Model for Customization Could Be Simple, Scalable and Affordable 

**Authors**: Jianqiao Wangni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07513)  

**Abstract**: Modern large language foundation models (LLM) have now entered the daily lives of millions of users. We ask a natural question whether it is possible to customize LLM for every user or every task. From system and industrial economy consideration, general continue-training or fine-tuning still require substantial computation and memory of training GPU nodes, whereas most inference nodes under deployment, possibly with lower-end GPUs, are configured to make forward pass fastest possible. We propose a framework to take full advantages of existing LLMs and systems of online service. We train an additional branch of transformer blocks on the final-layer embedding of pretrained LLMs, which is the base, then a carry-on module merge the base models to compose a customized LLM. We can mix multiple layers, or multiple LLMs specialized in different domains such as chat, coding, math, to form a new mixture of LLM that best fit a new task. As the base model don't need to update parameters, we are able to outsource most computation of the training job on inference nodes, and only train a lightweight carry-on on training nodes, where we consume less than 1GB GPU memory to train a 100M carry-on layer on 30B LLM. We tested Qwen and DeepSeek opensourced models for continue-pretraining and got faster loss convergence. We use it to improve solving math questions with extremely small computation and model size, with 1000 data samples of chain-of-thoughts, and as small as 1 MB parameters of two layer layer carry-on, and the results are promising.

# CMEdataset Advancing China Map Detection and Standardization with Digital Image Resources 

**Authors**: Yan Xu, Zhenqiang Zhang, Zhiwei Zhou, Liting Geng, Yue Li, Jintao Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07476)  

**Abstract**: Digital images of Chinas maps play a crucial role in map detection, particularly in ensuring national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and map compliance. However, there is currently no publicly available dataset specifically dedicated to problematic maps the CME dataset. Existing datasets primarily focus on general map data and are insufficient for effectively identifying complex issues such as national boundary misrepresentations, missing elements, and blurred boundaries. Therefore, this study creates a Problematic Map dataset that covers five key problem areas, aiming to provide diverse samples for problematic map detection technologies, support high-precision map compliance detection, and enhance map data quality and timeliness. This dataset not only provides essential resources for map compliance, national security monitoring, and map updates, but also fosters innovation and application of related technologies.

# Synthetic CT Generation from Time-of-Flight Non-Attenutaion-Corrected PET for Whole-Body PET Attenuation Correction 

**Authors**: Weijie Chen, James Wang, Alan McMillan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07450)  

**Abstract**: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging requires accurate attenuation correction (AC) to account for photon loss due to tissue density variations. In PET/MR systems, computed tomography (CT), which offers a straightforward estimation of AC is not available. This study presents a deep learning approach to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images directly from Time-of-Flight (TOF) non-attenuation corrected (NAC) PET images, enhancing AC for PET/MR. We first evaluated models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets for a CT-to-CT reconstruction task, finding that the pre-trained model outperformed those trained solely on medical datasets. The pre-trained model was then fine-tuned using an institutional dataset of 35 TOF NAC PET and CT volume pairs, achieving the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 74.49 HU and highest peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 28.66 dB within the body contour region. Visual assessments demonstrated improved reconstruction of both bone and soft tissue structures from TOF NAC PET images. This work highlights the effectiveness of using pre-trained deep learning models for medical image translation tasks. Future work will assess the impact of sCT on PET attenuation correction and explore additional neural network architectures and datasets to further enhance performance and practical applications in PET imaging.

# LoRI: Reducing Cross-Task Interference in Multi-Task Low-Rank Adaptation 

**Authors**: Juzheng Zhang, Jiacheng You, Ashwinee Panda, Tom Goldstein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07448)  

**Abstract**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet it still incurs notable overhead and suffers from parameter interference in multi-task scenarios. We propose LoRA with Reduced Interference (LoRI), a simple yet effective approach that freezes the projection matrices $A$ as random projections and sparsifies the matrices $B$ using task-specific masks. This design substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong task performance. Moreover, LoRI minimizes cross-task interference in adapter merging by leveraging the orthogonality between adapter subspaces, and supports continual learning by using sparsity to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across natural language understanding, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment tasks demonstrate that LoRI outperforms full fine-tuning and existing PEFT methods, while using up to 95% fewer trainable parameters than LoRA. In multi-task experiments, LoRI enables effective adapter merging and continual learning with reduced cross-task interference. Code is available at: this https URL

# Over-Relying on Reliance: Towards Realistic Evaluations of AI-Based Clinical Decision Support 

**Authors**: Venkatesh Sivaraman, Katelyn Morrison, Will Epperson, Adam Perer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07423)  

**Abstract**: As AI-based clinical decision support (AI-CDS) is introduced in more and more aspects of healthcare services, HCI research plays an increasingly important role in designing for complementarity between AI and clinicians. However, current evaluations of AI-CDS often fail to capture when AI is and is not useful to clinicians. This position paper reflects on our work and influential AI-CDS literature to advocate for moving beyond evaluation metrics like Trust, Reliance, Acceptance, and Performance on the AI's task (what we term the "trap" of human-AI collaboration). Although these metrics can be meaningful in some simple scenarios, we argue that optimizing for them ignores important ways that AI falls short of clinical benefit, as well as ways that clinicians successfully use AI. As the fields of HCI and AI in healthcare develop new ways to design and evaluate CDS tools, we call on the community to prioritize ecologically valid, domain-appropriate study setups that measure the emergent forms of value that AI can bring to healthcare professionals.

# The Role of Machine Learning in Reducing Healthcare Costs: The Impact of Medication Adherence and Preventive Care on Hospitalization Expenses 

**Authors**: Yixin Zhang, Yisong Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07422)  

**Abstract**: This study reveals the important role of prevention care and medication adherence in reducing hospitalizations. By using a structured dataset of 1,171 patients, four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks are applied to predict five-year hospitalization risk, with the Gradient Boosting model achieving the highest accuracy of 81.2%. The result demonstrated that patients with high medication adherence and consistent preventive care can reduce 38.3% and 37.7% in hospitalization risk. The finding also suggests that targeted preventive care can have positive Return on Investment (ROI), and therefore ML models can effectively direct personalized interventions and contribute to long-term medical savings.

# LauraTSE: Target Speaker Extraction using Auto-Regressive Decoder-Only Language Models 

**Authors**: Beilong Tang, Bang Zeng, Ming Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07402)  

**Abstract**: We propose LauraTSE, an Auto-Regressive Decoder-Only Language Model for Target Speaker Extraction (TSE) based on the LauraGPT backbone. It employs a small-scale auto-regressive decoder-only language model which takes the continuous representations for both the mixture and the reference speeches and produces the first few layers of the target speech's discrete codec representations. In addition, a one-step encoder-only language model reconstructs the sum of the predicted codec embeddings using both the mixture and the reference information. Our approach achieves superior or comparable performance to existing generative and discriminative TSE models. To the best of our knowledge, LauraTSE is the first single-task TSE model to leverage an auto-regressive decoder-only language model as the backbone.

# A Novel Mamba-based Sequential Recommendation Method 

**Authors**: Jun Yuan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07398)  

**Abstract**: Sequential recommendation (SR), which encodes user activity to predict the next action, has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in developing commercial personalized recommendation systems. Although Transformer-based models have proven effective for sequential recommendation, the complexity of the self-attention module in Transformers scales quadratically with the sequence length. Controlling model complexity is essential for large-scale recommendation systems, as these systems may need to handle billion-scale vocabularies that evolve continuously, as well as user behavior sequences that can exceed tens of thousands in length. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-head latent Mamba architecture, which employs multiple low-dimensional Mamba layers and fully connected layers coupled with positional encoding to simultaneously capture historical and item information within each latent subspace. Our proposed method not only enables scaling up to large-scale parameters but also extends to multi-domain recommendation by integrating and fine-tuning LLMs. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate how Hydra effectively addresses the effectiveness-efficiency dilemma, outperforming state-of-the-art sequential recommendation baselines with significantly fewer parameters and reduced training time.

# MicroNAS: An Automated Framework for Developing a Fall Detection System 

**Authors**: Seyed Mojtaba Mohasel, John Sheppard, Lindsey K. Molina, Richard R. Neptune, Shane R. Wurdeman, Corey A. Pew  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07397)  

**Abstract**: This work presents MicroNAS, an automated neural architecture search tool specifically designed to create models optimized for microcontrollers with small memory resources. The ESP32 microcontroller, with 320 KB of memory, is used as the target platform. The artificial intelligence contribution lies in a novel method for optimizing convolutional neural network and gated recurrent unit architectures by considering the memory size of the target microcontroller as a guide. A comparison is made between memory-driven model optimization and traditional two-stage methods, which use pruning, to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. To demonstrate the engineering application of MicroNAS, a fall detection system (FDS) for lower-limb amputees is developed as a pilot study. A critical challenge in fall detection studies, class imbalance in the dataset, is addressed. The results show that MicroNAS models achieved higher F1-scores than alternative approaches, such as ensemble methods and H2O Automated Machine Learning, presenting a significant step forward in real-time FDS development. Biomechanists using body-worn sensors for activity detection can adopt the open-source code to design machine learning models tailored for microcontroller platforms with limited memory.

# Automating quantum feature map design via large language models 

**Authors**: Kenya Sakka, Kosuke Mitarai, Keisuke Fujii  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07396)  

**Abstract**: Quantum feature maps are a key component of quantum machine learning, encoding classical data into quantum states to exploit the expressive power of high-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Despite their theoretical promise, designing quantum feature maps that offer practical advantages over classical methods remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose an agentic system that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines quantum feature maps using large language models. The system consists of five component: Generation, Storage, Validation, Evaluation, and Review. Using these components, it iteratively improves quantum feature maps. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show that it can successfully discover and refine feature maps without human intervention. The best feature map generated outperforms existing quantum baselines and achieves competitive accuracy compared to classical kernels across MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Our approach provides a framework for exploring dataset-adaptive quantum features and highlights the potential of LLM-driven automation in quantum algorithm design.

# FAIR-SIGHT: Fairness Assurance in Image Recognition via Simultaneous Conformal Thresholding and Dynamic Output Repair 

**Authors**: Arya Fayyazi, Mehdi Kamal, Massoud Pedram  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07395)  

**Abstract**: We introduce FAIR-SIGHT, an innovative post-hoc framework designed to ensure fairness in computer vision systems by combining conformal prediction with a dynamic output repair mechanism. Our approach calculates a fairness-aware non-conformity score that simultaneously assesses prediction errors and fairness violations. Using conformal prediction, we establish an adaptive threshold that provides rigorous finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. When the non-conformity score for a new image exceeds the calibrated threshold, FAIR-SIGHT implements targeted corrective adjustments, such as logit shifts for classification and confidence recalibration for detection, to reduce both group and individual fairness disparities, all without the need for retraining or having access to internal model parameters. Comprehensive theoretical analysis validates our method's error control and convergence properties. At the same time, extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets show that FAIR-SIGHT significantly reduces fairness disparities while preserving high predictive performance.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07394)  

**Abstract**: Climate science studies the structure and dynamics of Earth's climate system and seeks to understand how climate changes over time, where the data is usually stored in the format of time series, recording the climate features, geolocation, time attributes, etc. Recently, much research attention has been paid to the climate benchmarks. In addition to the most common task of weather forecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the modality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity prediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and confidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the artificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper, we first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M, which aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather events data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a unified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also propose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive performance in weather forecasting, thunderstorm alerts, and crop segmentation tasks in the proposed ClimateBench-M. The data and code of ClimateBench-M are publicly available at this https URL.

# Task-Circuit Quantization: Leveraging Knowledge Localization and Interpretability for Compression 

**Authors**: Hanqi Xiao, Yi-Lin Sung, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07389)  

**Abstract**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

# Min-Max Optimisation for Nonconvex-Nonconcave Functions Using a Random Zeroth-Order Extragradient Algorithm 

**Authors**: Amir Ali Farzin, Yuen Man Pun, Philipp Braun, Antoine Lesage-landry, Youssef Diouane, Iman Shames  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07388)  

**Abstract**: This study explores the performance of the random Gaussian smoothing Zeroth-Order ExtraGradient (ZO-EG) scheme considering min-max optimisation problems with possibly NonConvex-NonConcave (NC-NC) objective functions. We consider both unconstrained and constrained, differentiable and non-differentiable settings. We discuss the min-max problem from the point of view of variational inequalities. For the unconstrained problem, we establish the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to the neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the NC-NC objective function, whose radius can be controlled under a variance reduction scheme, along with its complexity. For the constrained problem, we introduce the new notion of proximal variational inequalities and give examples of functions satisfying this property. Moreover, we prove analogous results to the unconstrained case for the constrained problem. For the non-differentiable case, we prove the convergence of the ZO-EG algorithm to a neighbourhood of an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the smoothed version of the objective function, where the radius of the neighbourhood can be controlled, which can be related to the ($\delta,\epsilon$)-Goldstein stationary point of the original objective function.

# TALE: A Tool-Augmented Framework for Reference-Free Evaluation of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Sher Badshah, Ali Emami, Hassan Sajjad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07385)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world, autonomous applications, relying on static, pre-annotated references for evaluation poses significant challenges in cost, scalability, and completeness. We propose Tool-Augmented LLM Evaluation (TALE), a framework to assess LLM outputs without predetermined ground-truth answers. Unlike conventional metrics that compare to fixed references or depend solely on LLM-as-a-judge knowledge, TALE employs an agent with tool-access capabilities that actively retrieves and synthesizes external evidence. It iteratively generates web queries, collects information, summarizes findings, and refines subsequent searches through reflection. By shifting away from static references, TALE aligns with free-form question-answering tasks common in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on multiple free-form QA benchmarks show that TALE not only outperforms standard reference-based metrics for measuring response accuracy but also achieves substantial to near-perfect agreement with human evaluations. TALE enhances the reliability of LLM evaluations in real-world, dynamic scenarios without relying on static references.

# PROPEL: Supervised and Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Supply Chain Planning 

**Authors**: Vahid Eghbal Akhlaghi, Reza Zandehshahvar, Pascal Van Hentenryck  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07383)  

**Abstract**: This paper considers how to fuse Machine Learning (ML) and optimization to solve large-scale Supply Chain Planning (SCP) optimization problems. These problems can be formulated as MIP models which feature both integer (non-binary) and continuous variables, as well as flow balance and capacity constraints. This raises fundamental challenges for existing integrations of ML and optimization that have focused on binary MIPs and graph problems. To address these, the paper proposes PROPEL, a new framework that combines optimization with both supervised and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to reduce the size of search space significantly. PROPEL uses supervised learning, not to predict the values of all integer variables, but to identify the variables that are fixed to zero in the optimal solution, leveraging the structure of SCP applications. PROPEL includes a DRL component that selects which fixed-at-zero variables must be relaxed to improve solution quality when the supervised learning step does not produce a solution with the desired optimality tolerance. PROPEL has been applied to industrial supply chain planning optimizations with millions of variables. The computational results show dramatic improvements in solution times and quality, including a 60% reduction in primal integral and an 88% primal gap reduction, and improvement factors of up to 13.57 and 15.92, respectively.

# Representation Meets Optimization: Training PINNs and PIKANs for Gray-Box Discovery in Systems Pharmacology 

**Authors**: Nazanin Ahmadi Daryakenari, Khemraj Shukla, George Em Karniadakis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07379)  

**Abstract**: Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) are gaining attention as an effective counterpart to the original multilayer perceptron-based Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Both representation models can address inverse problems and facilitate gray-box system identification. However, a comprehensive understanding of their performance in terms of accuracy and speed remains underexplored. In particular, we introduce a modified PIKAN architecture, tanh-cPIKAN, which is based on Chebyshev polynomials for parametrization of the univariate functions with an extra nonlinearity for enhanced performance. We then present a systematic investigation of how choices of the optimizer, representation, and training configuration influence the performance of PINNs and PIKANs in the context of systems pharmacology modeling. We benchmark a wide range of first-order, second-order, and hybrid optimizers, including various learning rate schedulers. We use the new Optax library to identify the most effective combinations for learning gray-boxes under ill-posed, non-unique, and data-sparse conditions. We examine the influence of model architecture (MLP vs. KAN), numerical precision (single vs. double), the need for warm-up phases for second-order methods, and sensitivity to the initial learning rate. We also assess the optimizer scalability for larger models and analyze the trade-offs introduced by JAX in terms of computational efficiency and numerical accuracy. Using two representative systems pharmacology case studies - a pharmacokinetics model and a chemotherapy drug-response model - we offer practical guidance on selecting optimizers and representation models/architectures for robust and efficient gray-box discovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for improving the training of physics-informed networks in biomedical applications and beyond.

# Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Multi-Level Text Alignment with LLMs 

**Authors**: Taibiao Zhao, Xiaobing Chen, Mingxuan Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07360)  

**Abstract**: The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to time series forecasting poses unique challenges, as time series data is continuous in nature, while LLMs operate on discrete tokens. Despite the success of LLMs in natural language processing (NLP) and other structured domains, aligning time series data with language-based representations while maintaining both predictive accuracy and interpretability remains a significant hurdle. Existing methods have attempted to reprogram time series data into text-based forms, but these often fall short in delivering meaningful, interpretable results. In this paper, we propose a multi-level text alignment framework for time series forecasting using LLMs that not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances the interpretability of time series representations. Our method decomposes time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, which are then reprogrammed into component-specific text representations. We introduce a multi-level alignment mechanism, where component-specific embeddings are aligned with pre-trained word tokens, enabling more interpretable forecasts. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy while providing good interpretability.

# A Balanced Approach of Rapid Genetic Exploration and Surrogate Exploitation for Hyperparameter Optimization 

**Authors**: Chul Kim, Inwhee Joe  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07359)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a new method for hyperparameter optimization (HPO) that balances exploration and exploitation. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) show promise in HPO, they often struggle with effective exploitation. To address this, we integrate a linear surrogate model into a genetic algorithm (GA), allowing for smooth integration of multiple strategies. This combination improves exploitation performance, achieving an average improvement of 1.89 percent (max 6.55 percent, min -3.45 percent) over existing HPO methods.

# Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Robust Source Separation in Smart City Acoustics 

**Authors**: Minh K. Quan, Mayuri Wijayasundara, Sujeeva Setunge, Pubudu N. Pathirana  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07345)  

**Abstract**: The cacophony of urban sounds presents a significant challenge for smart city applications that rely on accurate acoustic scene analysis. Effectively analyzing these complex soundscapes, often characterized by overlapping sound sources, diverse acoustic events, and unpredictable noise levels, requires precise source separation. This task becomes more complicated when only limited training data is available. This paper introduces a novel Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (p-QIGA) for source separation, drawing inspiration from quantum information theory to enhance acoustic scene analysis in smart cities. By leveraging quantum superposition for efficient solution space exploration and entanglement to handle correlated sources, p-QIGA achieves robust separation even with limited data. These quantum-inspired concepts are integrated into a genetic algorithm framework to optimize source separation parameters. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on two datasets: the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset, representing typical urban soundscapes, and the Silent Cities dataset, capturing quieter urban environments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experimental results show that the p-QIGA achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting superior resilience to noise and limited training data, achieving up to 8.2 dB signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) in noisy environments and outperforming baseline methods by up to 2 dB with only 10% of the training data. This research highlights the potential of p-QIGA to advance acoustic signal processing in smart cities, particularly for noise pollution monitoring and acoustic surveillance.

# Zeus: Zero-shot LLM Instruction for Union Segmentation in Multimodal Medical Imaging 

**Authors**: Siyuan Dai, Kai Ye, Guodong Liu, Haoteng Tang, Liang Zhan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07336)  

**Abstract**: Medical image segmentation has achieved remarkable success through the continuous advancement of UNet-based and Transformer-based foundation backbones. However, clinical diagnosis in the real world often requires integrating domain knowledge, especially textual information. Conducting multimodal learning involves visual and text modalities shown as a solution, but collecting paired vision-language datasets is expensive and time-consuming, posing significant challenges. Inspired by the superior ability in numerous cross-modal tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we proposed a novel Vision-LLM union framework to address the issues. Specifically, we introduce frozen LLMs for zero-shot instruction generation based on corresponding medical images, imitating the radiology scanning and report generation process. {To better approximate real-world diagnostic processes}, we generate more precise text instruction from multimodal radiology images (e.g., T1-w or T2-w MRI and CT). Based on the impressive ability of semantic understanding and rich knowledge of LLMs. This process emphasizes extracting special features from different modalities and reunion the information for the ultimate clinical diagnostic. With generated text instruction, our proposed union segmentation framework can handle multimodal segmentation without prior collected vision-language datasets. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments with influential baselines, the statistical results and the visualized case study demonstrate the superiority of our novel method.}

# Objaverse++: Curated 3D Object Dataset with Quality Annotations 

**Authors**: Chendi Lin, Heshan Liu, Qunshu Lin, Zachary Bright, Shitao Tang, Yihui He, Minghao Liu, Ling Zhu, Cindy Le  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07334)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents Objaverse++, a curated subset of Objaverse enhanced with detailed attribute annotations by human experts. Recent advances in 3D content generation have been driven by large-scale datasets such as Objaverse, which contains over 800,000 3D objects collected from the Internet. Although Objaverse represents the largest available 3D asset collection, its utility is limited by the predominance of low-quality models. To address this limitation, we manually annotate 10,000 3D objects with detailed attributes, including aesthetic quality scores, texture color classifications, multi-object composition flags, transparency characteristics, etc. Then, we trained a neural network capable of annotating the tags for the rest of the Objaverse dataset. Through experiments and a user study on generation results, we demonstrate that models pre-trained on our quality-focused subset achieve better performance than those trained on the larger dataset of Objaverse in image-to-3D generation tasks. In addition, by comparing multiple subsets of training data filtered by our tags, our results show that the higher the data quality, the faster the training loss converges. These findings suggest that careful curation and rich annotation can compensate for the raw dataset size, potentially offering a more efficient path to develop 3D generative models. We release our enhanced dataset of approximately 500,000 curated 3D models to facilitate further research on various downstream tasks in 3D computer vision. In the near future, we aim to extend our annotations to cover the entire Objaverse dataset.

# Identifying regions of interest in whole slide images of renal cell carcinoma 

**Authors**: Mohammed Lamine Benomar, Nesma Settouti, Eric Debreuve, Xavier Descombes, Damien Ambrosetti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07313)  

**Abstract**: The histopathological images contain a huge amount of information, which can make diagnosis an extremely timeconsuming and tedious task. In this study, we developed a completely automated system to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in whole slide images (WSI) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), to reduce time analysis and assist pathologists in making more accurate decisions. The proposed approach is based on an efficient texture descriptor named dominant rotated local binary pattern (DRLBP) and color transformation to reveal and exploit the immense texture variability at the microscopic high magnifications level. Thereby, the DRLBPs retain the structural information and utilize the magnitude values in a local neighborhood for more discriminative power. For the classification of the relevant ROIs, feature extraction of WSIs patches was performed on the color channels separately to form the histograms. Next, we used the most frequently occurring patterns as a feature selection step to discard non-informative features. The performances of different classifiers on a set of 1800 kidney cancer patches originating from 12 whole slide images were compared and evaluated. Furthermore, the small size of the image dataset allows to investigate deep learning approach based on transfer learning for image patches classification by using deep features and fine-tuning methods. High recognition accuracy was obtained and the classifiers are efficient, the best precision result was 99.17% achieved with SVM. Moreover, transfer learning models perform well with comparable performance, and the highest precision using ResNet-50 reached 98.50%. The proposed approach results revealed a very efficient image classification and demonstrated efficacy in identifying ROIs. This study presents an automatic system to detect regions of interest relevant to the diagnosis of kidney cancer in whole slide histopathology images.

# PAYADOR: A Minimalist Approach to Grounding Language Models on Structured Data for Interactive Storytelling and Role-playing Games 

**Authors**: Santiago Góngora, Luis Chiruzzo, Gonzalo Méndez, Pablo Gervás  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07304)  

**Abstract**: Every time an Interactive Storytelling (IS) system gets a player input, it is facing the world-update problem. Classical approaches to this problem consist in mapping that input to known preprogrammed actions, what can severely constrain the free will of the player. When the expected experience has a strong focus on improvisation, like in Role-playing Games (RPGs), this problem is critical. In this paper we present PAYADOR, a different approach that focuses on predicting the outcomes of the actions instead of representing the actions themselves. To implement this approach, we ground a Large Language Model to a minimal representation of the fictional world, obtaining promising results. We make this contribution open-source, so it can be adapted and used for other related research on unleashing the co-creativity power of RPGs.

# Modeling Response Consistency in Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Shared and Separate Context Approaches 

**Authors**: Tooraj Helmi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07303)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in multi-agent systems (MAS) to enhance collaborative problem-solving and interactive reasoning. Recent advancements have enabled LLMs to function as autonomous agents capable of understanding complex interactions across multiple topics. However, deploying LLMs in MAS introduces challenges related to context management, response consistency, and scalability, especially when agents must operate under memory limitations and handle noisy inputs. While prior research has explored optimizing context sharing and response latency in LLM-driven MAS, these efforts often focus on either fully centralized or decentralized configurations, each with distinct trade-offs.
In this paper, we develop a probabilistic framework to analyze the impact of shared versus separate context configurations on response consistency and response times in LLM-based MAS. We introduce the Response Consistency Index (RCI) as a metric to evaluate the effects of context limitations, noise, and inter-agent dependencies on system performance. Our approach differs from existing research by focusing on the interplay between memory constraints and noise management, providing insights into optimizing scalability and response times in environments with interdependent topics. Through this analysis, we offer a comprehensive understanding of how different configurations impact the efficiency of LLM-driven multi-agent systems, thereby guiding the design of more robust architectures.

# A Multi-Phase Analysis of Blood Culture Stewardship: Machine Learning Prediction, Expert Recommendation Assessment, and LLM Automation 

**Authors**: Fatemeh Amrollahi, Nicholas Marshall, Fateme Nateghi Haredasht, Kameron C Black, Aydin Zahedivash, Manoj V Maddali, Stephen P. Ma, Amy Chang, MD Phar Stanley C Deresinski, Mary Kane Goldstein, Steven M. Asch, Niaz Banaei, Jonathan H Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07278)  

**Abstract**: Blood cultures are often over ordered without clear justification, straining healthcare resources and contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use pressures worsened by the global shortage. In study of 135483 emergency department (ED) blood culture orders, we developed machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk of bacteremia using structured electronic health record (EHR) data and provider notes via a large language model (LLM). The structured models AUC improved from 0.76 to 0.79 with note embeddings and reached 0.81 with added diagnosis codes. Compared to an expert recommendation framework applied by human reviewers and an LLM-based pipeline, our ML approach offered higher specificity without compromising sensitivity. The recommendation framework achieved sensitivity 86%, specificity 57%, while the LLM maintained high sensitivity (96%) but over classified negatives, reducing specificity (16%). These findings demonstrate that ML models integrating structured and unstructured data can outperform consensus recommendations, enhancing diagnostic stewardship beyond existing standards of care.

# Evaluating Parameter-Based Training Performance of Neural Networks and Variational Quantum Circuits 

**Authors**: Michael Kölle, Alexander Feist, Jonas Stein, Sebastian Wölckert, Claudia Linnhoff-Popien  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07273)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, neural networks (NNs) have driven significant advances in machine learning. However, as tasks grow more complex, NNs often require large numbers of trainable parameters, which increases computational and energy demands. Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) offer a promising alternative: they leverage quantum mechanics to capture intricate relationships and typically need fewer parameters. In this work, we evaluate NNs and VQCs on simple supervised and reinforcement learning tasks, examining models with different parameter sizes. We simulate VQCs and execute selected parts of the training process on real quantum hardware to approximate actual training times. Our results show that VQCs can match NNs in performance while using significantly fewer parameters, despite longer training durations. As quantum technology and algorithms advance, and VQC architectures improve, we posit that VQCs could become advantageous for certain machine learning tasks.

# Face-LLaVA: Facial Expression and Attribute Understanding through Instruction Tuning 

**Authors**: Ashutosh Chaubey, Xulang Guan, Mohammad Soleymani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07198)  

**Abstract**: The human face plays a central role in social communication, necessitating the use of performant computer vision tools for human-centered applications. We propose Face-LLaVA, a multimodal large language model for face-centered, in-context learning, including facial expression and attribute recognition. Additionally, Face-LLaVA is able to generate natural language descriptions that can be used for reasoning. Leveraging existing visual databases, we first developed FaceInstruct-1M, a face-centered database for instruction tuning MLLMs for face processing. We then developed a novel face-specific visual encoder powered by Face-Region Guided Cross-Attention that integrates face geometry with local visual features. We evaluated the proposed method across nine different datasets and five different face processing tasks, including facial expression recognition, action unit detection, facial attribute detection, age estimation and deepfake detection. Face-LLaVA achieves superior results compared to existing open-source MLLMs and competitive performance compared to commercial solutions. Our model output also receives a higher reasoning rating by GPT under a zero-shot setting across all the tasks. Both our dataset and model wil be released at this https URL to support future advancements in social AI and foundational vision-language research.

# HypoEval: Hypothesis-Guided Evaluation for Natural Language Generation 

**Authors**: Mingxuan Li, Hanchen Li, Chenhao Tan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07174)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for automating the evaluation of natural language generation. Previous frameworks of LLM-as-a-judge fall short in two ways: they either use zero-shot setting without consulting any human input, which leads to low alignment, or fine-tune LLMs on labeled data, which requires a non-trivial number of samples. Moreover, previous methods often provide little reasoning behind automated evaluations. In this paper, we propose HypoEval, Hypothesis-guided Evaluation framework, which first uses a small corpus of human evaluations to generate more detailed rubrics for human judgments and then incorporates a checklist-like approach to combine LLM's assigned scores on each decomposed dimension to acquire overall scores. With only 30 human evaluations, HypoEval achieves state-of-the-art performance in alignment with both human rankings (Spearman correlation) and human scores (Pearson correlation), on average outperforming G-Eval by 11.86% and fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with at least 3 times more human evaluations by 11.95%. Furthermore, we conduct systematic studies to assess the robustness of HypoEval, highlighting its effectiveness as a reliable and interpretable automated evaluation framework.

# Trustworthy AI Must Account for Intersectionality 

**Authors**: Jesse C. Cresswell  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07170)  

**Abstract**: Trustworthy AI encompasses many aspirational aspects for aligning AI systems with human values, including fairness, privacy, robustness, explainability, and uncertainty quantification. However, efforts to enhance one aspect often introduce unintended trade-offs that negatively impact others, making it challenging to improve all aspects simultaneously. In this position paper, we review notable approaches to these five aspects and systematically consider every pair, detailing the negative interactions that can arise. For example, applying differential privacy to model training can amplify biases in the data, undermining fairness. Drawing on these findings, we take the position that addressing trustworthiness along each axis in isolation is insufficient. Instead, research on Trustworthy AI must account for intersectionality between aspects and adopt a holistic view across all relevant axes at once. To illustrate our perspective, we provide guidance on how researchers can work towards integrated trustworthiness, a case study on how intersectionality applies to the financial industry, and alternative views to our position.

# PLM-eXplain: Divide and Conquer the Protein Embedding Space 

**Authors**: Jan van Eck, Dea Gogishvili, Wilson Silva, Sanne Abeln  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07156)  

**Abstract**: Protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionised computational biology through their ability to generate powerful sequence representations for diverse prediction tasks. However, their black-box nature limits biological interpretation and translation to actionable insights. We present an explainable adapter layer - PLM-eXplain (PLM-X), that bridges this gap by factoring PLM embeddings into two components: an interpretable subspace based on established biochemical features, and a residual subspace that preserves the model's predictive power. Using embeddings from ESM2, our adapter incorporates well-established properties, including secondary structure and hydropathy while maintaining high performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across three protein-level classification tasks: prediction of extracellular vesicle association, identification of transmembrane helices, and prediction of aggregation propensity. PLM-X enables biological interpretation of model decisions without sacrificing accuracy, offering a generalisable solution for enhancing PLM interpretability across various downstream applications. This work addresses a critical need in computational biology by providing a bridge between powerful deep learning models and actionable biological insights.

# Secure Text Mail Encryption with Generative Adversarial Networks 

**Authors**: Alexej Schelle  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07140)  

**Abstract**: This work presents an encryption model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Encryption of RTF-8 data is realized by dynamically generating decimal numbers that lead to the encryption and decryption of alphabetic strings in integer representation by simple addition rules, the modulus of the dimension of the considered alphabet. The binary numbers for the private dynamical keys correlate with the binary numbers of public reference keys from a mapping defined by the specific GAN configuration. For reversible encryption with bijective mapping between dynamic and reference keys as defined by the GAN encryptor with random combinations of NOT logical gates between bitwise subcomponents of the transmitted text signal, secure text encryption can be realized by transferring a GAN-encrypted public key with encrypted text from a sender to a receiver. Using the technique described above, secure text mail transfer can be realized from component-wise encryption of text mail strings with total key sizes of up to $10^{8}$ bits that define random decimal numbers obtained from the GAN. From the present model, we assert that encrypted texts can be transmitted more efficiently and securely than from RSA encryption, as long as users of the specific configuration of the GAN encryption model are unaware of the GAN encryptor circuit.

# Sacred or Secular? Religious Bias in AI-Generated Financial Advice 

**Authors**: Muhammad Salar Khan, Hamza Umer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07118)  

**Abstract**: This study examines religious biases in AI-generated financial advice, focusing on ChatGPT's responses to financial queries. Using a prompt-based methodology and content analysis, we find that 50% of the financial emails generated by ChatGPT exhibit religious biases, with explicit biases present in both ingroup and outgroup interactions. While ingroup biases personalize responses based on religious alignment, outgroup biases introduce religious framing that may alienate clients or create ideological friction. These findings align with broader research on AI bias and suggest that ChatGPT is not merely reflecting societal biases but actively shaping financial discourse based on perceived religious identity. Using the Critical Algorithm Studies framework, we argue that ChatGPT functions as a mediator of financial narratives, selectively reinforcing religious perspectives. This study underscores the need for greater transparency, bias mitigation strategies, and regulatory oversight to ensure neutrality in AI-driven financial services.

# RP-SAM2: Refining Point Prompts for Stable Surgical Instrument Segmentation 

**Authors**: Nuren Zhaksylyk, Ibrahim Almakky, Jay Paranjape, S. Swaroop Vedula, Shameema Sikder, Vishal M. Patel, Mohammad Yaqub

**Abstract**: Accurate surgical instrument segmentation is essential in cataract surgery for tasks such as skill assessment and workflow optimization. However, limited annotated data makes it difficult to develop fully automatic models. Prompt-based methods like SAM2 offer flexibility yet remain highly sensitive to the point prompt placement, often leading to inconsistent segmentations. We address this issue by introducing RP-SAM2, which incorporates a novel shift block and a compound loss function to stabilize point prompts. Our approach reduces annotator reliance on precise point positioning while maintaining robust segmentation capabilities. Experiments on the Cataract1k dataset demonstrate that RP-SAM2 improves segmentation accuracy, with a 2% mDSC gain, a 21.36% reduction in mHD95, and decreased variance across random single-point prompt results compared to SAM2. Additionally, on the CaDIS dataset, pseudo masks generated by RP-SAM2 for fine-tuning SAM2's mask decoder outperformed those generated by SAM2. These results highlight RP-SAM2 as a practical, stable and reliable solution for semi-automatic instrument segmentation in data-constrained medical settings.

# ChatBench: From Static Benchmarks to Human-AI Evaluation 

**Authors**: Serina Chang, Ashton Anderson, Jake M. Hofman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07114)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid adoption of LLM-based chatbots, there is a pressing need to evaluate what humans and LLMs can achieve together. However, standard benchmarks, such as MMLU, measure LLM capabilities in isolation (i.e., "AI-alone"). Here, we design and conduct a user study to convert MMLU questions into user-AI conversations, by seeding the user with the question and having them carry out a conversation with the LLM to answer their question. We release ChatBench, a new dataset with AI-alone, user-alone, and user-AI data for 396 questions and two LLMs, including 144K answers and 7,336 user-AI conversations. We find that AI-alone accuracy fails to predict user-AI accuracy, with significant differences across multiple subjects (math, physics, and moral reasoning), and we analyze the user-AI conversations to provide insight into how they diverge from AI-alone benchmarks. Finally, we show that fine-tuning a user simulator on a subset of ChatBench improves its ability to estimate user-AI accuracies, increasing correlation on held-out questions by more than 20 points, creating possibilities for scaling interactive evaluation.

# OSCAR: Online Soft Compression And Reranking 

**Authors**: Maxime Louis, Thibault Formal, Hervé Dejean, Stéphane Clinchant  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07109)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge, leading to improved accuracy and relevance. However, scaling RAG pipelines remains computationally expensive as retrieval sizes grow. To address this, we introduce OSCAR, a novel query-dependent online soft compression method that reduces computational overhead while preserving performance. Unlike traditional hard compression methods, which shorten retrieved texts, or soft compression approaches, which map documents to continuous embeddings offline, OSCAR dynamically compresses retrieved information at inference time, eliminating storage overhead and enabling higher compression rates. Additionally, we extend OSCAR to simultaneously perform reranking, further optimizing the efficiency of the RAG pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a 2-5x speed-up in inference and minimal to no loss in accuracy for LLMs ranging from 1B to 24B parameters. The models are available at: this https URL.

# OKRA: an Explainable, Heterogeneous, Multi-Stakeholder Job Recommender System 

**Authors**: Roan Schellingerhout, Francesco Barile, Nava Tintarev  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07108)  

**Abstract**: The use of recommender systems in the recruitment domain has been labeled as 'high-risk' in recent legislation. As a result, strict requirements regarding explainability and fairness have been put in place to ensure proper treatment of all involved stakeholders. To allow for stakeholder-specific explainability, while also handling highly heterogeneous recruitment data, we propose a novel explainable multi-stakeholder job recommender system using graph neural networks: the Occupational Knowledge-based Recommender using Attention (OKRA). The proposed method is capable of providing both candidate- and company-side recommendations and explanations. We find that OKRA performs substantially better than six baselines in terms of nDCG for two datasets. Furthermore, we find that the tested models show a bias toward candidates and vacancies located in urban areas. Overall, our findings suggest that OKRA provides a balance between accuracy, explainability, and fairness.

# FG-RAG: Enhancing Query-Focused Summarization with Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG 

**Authors**: Yubin Hong, Chaofan Li, Jingyi Zhang, Yingxia Shao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07103)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models to provide more precise and pertinent responses by incorporating external knowledge. In the Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) task, GraphRAG-based approaches have notably enhanced the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated responses. However, existing GraphRAG-based approaches predominantly focus on coarse-grained information summarization without being aware of the specific query, and the retrieved content lacks sufficient contextual information to generate comprehensive responses. To address the deficiencies of current RAG systems, we propose Context-Aware Fine-Grained Graph RAG (FG-RAG) to enhance the performance of the QFS task. FG-RAG employs Context-Aware Entity Expansion in graph retrieval to expand the coverage of retrieved entities in the graph, thus providing enough contextual information for the retrieved content. Furthermore, FG-RAG utilizes Query-Level Fine-Grained Summarization to incorporate fine-grained details during response generation, enhancing query awareness for the generated summarization. Our evaluation demonstrates that FG-RAG outperforms other RAG systems in multiple metrics of comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment when handling the QFS task. Our implementation is available at this https URL.

# Personalized Recommendation Models in Federated Settings: A Survey 

**Authors**: Chunxu Zhang, Guodong Long, Zijian Zhang, Zhiwei Li, Honglei Zhang, Qiang Yang, Bo Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07101)  

**Abstract**: Federated recommender systems (FedRecSys) have emerged as a pivotal solution for privacy-aware recommendations, balancing growing demands for data security and personalized experiences. Current research efforts predominantly concentrate on adapting traditional recommendation architectures to federated environments, optimizing communication efficiency, and mitigating security vulnerabilities. However, user personalization modeling, which is essential for capturing heterogeneous preferences in this decentralized and non-IID data setting, remains underexplored. This survey addresses this gap by systematically exploring personalization in FedRecSys, charting its evolution from centralized paradigms to federated-specific innovations. We establish a foundational definition of personalization in a federated setting, emphasizing personalized models as a critical solution for capturing fine-grained user preferences. The work critically examines the technical hurdles of building personalized FedRecSys and synthesizes promising methodologies to meet these challenges. As the first consolidated study in this domain, this survey serves as both a technical reference and a catalyst for advancing personalized FedRecSys research.
