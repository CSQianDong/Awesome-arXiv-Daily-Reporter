ChronoQA is constructed from over 300,000 news articles published between 2019 and 2024, and contains 5,176 high-quality questions covering absolute, aggregate, and relative temporal types with both explicit and implicit time expressions. The dataset supports both single- and multi-document scenarios, reflecting the real-world requirements for temporal alignment and logical consistency. ChronoQA features comprehensive structural annotations and has undergone multi-stage validation, including rule-based, LLM-based, and human evaluation, to ensure data quality. By providing a dynamic, reliable, and scalable resource, ChronoQA enables structured evaluation across a wide range of temporal tasks, and serves as a robust benchmark for advancing time-sensitive retrieval-augmented question answering systems.'}

We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\\% and Precision@K by $\\sim$2.5$\\times$ for $K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs. Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal research assistance.'}

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings, their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation (RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making."}

While retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources. The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.'}

We assess the reliability of synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias favoring certain generators.'}

As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input.'}

In this work, we propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability. Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors.'}

Our system leverages an LLM agent and synthetic AI technologies to create realistic virtual recruiters capable of conducting personalized, real-time conversational interviews. The framework dynamically adapts interview scenarios using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to match individual resumes with specific job requirements across multiple languages.

Experiments with university-level candidates show that the system consistently aligns its assessments with job requirements, faithfully preserves resume content, and earns high satisfaction ratings, with the lightweight Gemma 3 model producing the most engaging conversations. Qualitative findings revealed that the standardized Japanese resume format improved document retrieval while diverse English resumes introduced additional variability, and they highlighted how cultural norms shape follow-up questioning strategies. Finally, we also outlined a contestable AI design that can explain, detect bias, and preserve human-in-the-loop to meet emerging regulatory expectations.'}
