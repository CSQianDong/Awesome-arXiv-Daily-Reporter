Despite the great success, most existing MDR methods adopt a single structure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge. However, the beneficial transferring information should vary across different domains. When there is knowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality, unselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious Negative Transfer Problem (NTP). Therefore, how to effectively model the complex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a direction worth exploring. To address these issues, we propose a simple and dynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain recommendation in this paper. SDSP presents the initial exploration of selecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP. Specifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to effectively model the complexity relationship between domains. Thereafter, the proposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the supervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure from the learned domain prototype. We emphasize that SDSP is a lightweight method that can be incorporated with existing MDR methods for better performance while not introducing excessive time overheads. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first solution that can explicitly measure domain-level gaps and dynamically select appropriate domains in the MDR field. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.'}

In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation task that can leverage a virtually unbounded range of affective states sought explicitly by the user in order to identify items that, upon consumption, are likely to induce those affective states. Correspondingly, we create a large dataset of user preferences containing expressions of fine-grained affective states that are mined from book reviews, and propose a Transformer-based architecture that leverages such affective expressions as input. We then use the resulting dataset of affective states preferences, together with the linked users and their histories of book readings, ratings, and reviews, to train and evaluate multiple recommendation models on the task of matching recommended items with affective preferences. Experiments show that the best results are obtained by models that can utilize textual descriptions of items and user affective preferences.'}

The prevailing two-tower architecture, though highly efficient due to its decoupled design and pre-caching, suffers from cross-domain interaction and coarse similarity metrics, undermining its capacity to model complex user-ad relationships. In this study, we propose the Hierarchical Interaction-Enhanced Two-Tower (HIT) model, a new architecture that augments the two-tower paradigm with two key components: $\\textit{generators}$ that pre-generate holistic vectors incorporating coarse-grained user-ad interactions through a dual-generator framework with a cosine-similarity-based generation loss as the training objective, and $\\textit{multi-head representers}$ that project embeddings into multiple latent subspaces to capture fine-grained, multi-faceted user interests and multi-dimensional ad attributes. This design enhances modeling effectiveness without compromising inference efficiency. Extensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale online A/B testing on Tencent's advertising platform demonstrate that HIT significantly outperforms several baselines in relevance metrics, yielding a $1.66\\%$ increase in Gross Merchandise Volume and a $1.55\\%$ improvement in Return on Investment, alongside similar serving latency to the vanilla two-tower models.

Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have surfaced as highly efficient models within the realm of recommender systems due to their ability to capture extensive relational information. The continuously expanding volume of data may render the training of GCNs excessively costly. To tackle this problem, incrementally training GCNs as new data blocks come in has become a vital research direction. Knowledge distillation techniques have been explored as a general paradigm to train GCNs incrementally and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem that typically occurs in incremental settings. However, we argue that current methods based on knowledge distillation introduce additional parameters and have a high model complexity, which results in unrealistic training time consumption in an incremental setting and thus difficult to actually deploy in the real world. In this work, we propose a light preference-driven distillation method to distill the preference score of a user for an item directly from historical interactions, which reduces the training time consumption in the incremental setting significantly without noticeable loss in performance. The experimental result on two general datasets shows that the proposed method can save training time from 1.5x to 9.5x compared to the existing methods and improves Recall@20 by 5.41% and 10.64% from the fine-tune method.'}

These limitations ultimately compromise system effectiveness and reduce platform profitability. In this paper, we present UniROM, an end-to-end generative architecture that Unifies online advertising Ranking as One Model. UniROM replaces cascaded stages with a single model to directly generate optimal ad sequences from the full candidate ad corpus in location-based services (LBS). The primary challenges associated with this approach stem from high costs of feature processing and computational bottlenecks in modeling externalities of large-scale candidate pools. To address these challenges, UniROM introduces an algorithm and engine co-designed hybrid feature service to decouple user and ad feature processing, reducing latency while preserving expressiveness. To efficiently extract intra- and cross-sequence mutual information, we propose RecFormer with an innovative cluster-attention mechanism as its core architectural component. Furthermore, we propose a bi-stage training strategy that integrates pre-training with reinforcement learning-based post-training to meet sophisticated platform and advertising objectives.

To address this challenge, we introduce LogiCoL, a logically-informed contrastive learning objective for dense retrievers. LogiCoL builds upon in-batch supervised contrastive learning, and learns dense retrievers to respect the subset and mutually-exclusive set relation between query results via two sets of soft constraints expressed via t-norm in the learning objective. We evaluate the effectiveness of LogiCoL on the task of entity retrieval, where the model is expected to retrieve a set of entities in Wikipedia that satisfy the implicit logical constraints in the query. We show that models trained with LogiCoL yield improvement both in terms of retrieval performance and logical consistency in the results. We provide detailed analysis and insights to uncover why queries with logical connectives are challenging for dense retrievers and why LogiCoL is most effective.'}

ADRec captures token interdependency through auto-regression while modeling per-token distributions through token-level diffusion. This dual approach enables the model to effectively capture both sequence dynamics and item representations, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. To further mitigate embedding collapse, we propose a three-stage training strategy: (1) pre-training the embedding weights, (2) aligning these weights with the ADRec backbone, and (3) fine-tuning the model. During inference, ADRec applies the denoising process only to the last token, ensuring that the meaningful patterns in historical interactions are preserved.

To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Tree Search-based User Lifelong Behavior Modeling framework (HiT-LBM). HiT-LBM integrates Chunked User Behavior Extraction (CUBE) and Hierarchical Tree Search for Interest (HTS) to capture diverse interests and interest evolution of user.

While efforts have been made to improve recommendation fairness, they often assume that users' sensitive attributes are available during model training. However, collecting sensitive information can be difficult, especially on platforms that involve no personal information disclosure. Therefore, we aim to improve recommendation fairness without any access to sensitive attributes. However, this is a non-trivial task because uncovering latent sensitive patterns from complicated user behaviors without explicit sensitive attributes can be difficult. Consequently, suboptimal estimates of sensitive distributions can hinder the fairness training process. To address these challenges, leveraging the remarkable reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel LLM-enhanced framework for Fair recommendation withOut Sensitive Attributes (LLMFOSA). A Multi-Persona Sensitive Information Inference module employs LLMs with distinct personas that mimic diverse human perceptions to infer and distill sensitive information. Furthermore, a Confusion-Aware Sensitive Representation Learning module incorporates inference results and rationales to develop robust sensitive representations, considering the mislabeling confusion and collective consensus among agents. The model is then optimized by a formulated mutual information objective. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate the effectiveness of LLMFOSA in improving fairness."}

We achieve this by retrieving a curated set of the most relevant user behaviors in natural language form. However, identifying informative CI is challenging due to the complexity of similarity and utility assessment. To tackle this, we introduce a Self-assessing COllaborative REtrieval framework (SCORE) following the retrieve-rerank paradigm. First, a Collaborative Retriever (CAR) is developed to consider both collaborative patterns and semantic similarity. Then, a Self-assessing Reranker (SARE) leverages LLMs' own reasoning to assess and prioritize retrieved behaviors.

Our previous work, LEGCF, effectively reduced embedding storage costs but struggled to maintain recommendation performance under stricter storage limits. Additionally, LEGCF did not address the extensive runtime computation costs associated with graph propagation, which involves heavy multiplication and accumulation operations (MACs). These challenges consequently hinder effective training and inference on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose Lightweight Embeddings with Rewired Graph for Graph Collaborative Filtering (LERG), an improved extension of LEGCF. LERG retains LEGCFs compositional codebook structure but introduces quantization techniques to reduce the storage cost, enabling the inclusion of more meta-embeddings within the same storage. To optimize graph propagation, we pretrain the quantized compositional embedding table using the full interaction graph on resource-rich servers, after which a fine-tuning stage is engaged to identify and prune low-contribution entities via a gradient-free binary integer programming approach, constructing a rewired graph that excludes these entities (i.e., user/item nodes) from propagating signals. The quantized compositional embedding table with selective embedding participation and sparse rewired graph are transferred to edge devices which significantly reduce computation memory and inference time. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets, including an industry-scale dataset, demonstrate that LERG achieves superior recommendation performance while dramatically reducing storage and computation costs for graph-based recommendation services.'}

While token-based matching increases ad coverage, it can reduce relevance due to overly permissive semantic expansion. This work extends keyword reach through document-side semantic keyword expansion, using a language model to broaden token-level matching without altering queries. We propose a solution using a pre-trained siamese model to generate dense vector representations of ad keywords and identify semantically related variants through nearest neighbor search. To maintain precision, we introduce a cluster-based thresholding mechanism that adjusts similarity cutoffs based on local semantic density. Each expanded keyword maps to a group of seller-listed items, which may only partially align with the original intent. To ensure relevance, we enhance the downstream relevance model by adapting it to the expanded keyword space using an incremental learning strategy with a lightweight decision tree ensemble. This system improves both relevance and click-through rate (CTR), offering a scalable, low-latency solution adaptable to evolving query behavior and advertising inventory.'}

To address these challenges, we introduce SearchExpert, a training method for LLMs to improve their multimedia search capabilities in response to complex search queries. Firstly, we reformulate the search plan in an efficient natural language representation to reduce token consumption. Then, we propose the supervised fine-tuning for searching (SFTS) to fine-tune LLM to adapt to these representations, together with an automated dataset construction pipeline. Secondly, to improve reasoning-intensive search capabilities, we propose the reinforcement learning from search feedback (RLSF) that takes the search results planned by LLM as the reward signals. Thirdly, we propose a multimedia understanding and generation agent that enables the fine-tuned LLM to process visual input and produce visual output during inference. Finally, we establish an automated benchmark construction pipeline and a human evaluation framework. Our resulting benchmark, SearchExpertBench-25, comprises 200 multiple-choice questions spanning financial and international news scenarios that require reasoning in searching.

Some highly relevant passages may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or logical clues. To solve this, we propose GainRAG, a novel approach that aligns the retriever\'s and LLM\'s preferences by defining a new metric, "gain", which measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs. Specifically, we propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data. In addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation. The experimental results on 6 datasets verify the effectiveness of GainRAG.'}

In this paper, we propose MTGR (Meituan Generative Recommendation) to address this issue. MTGR is modeling based on the HSTU architecture and can retain the original deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) features, including cross features. Additionally, MTGR achieves training and inference acceleration through user-level compression to ensure efficient scaling. We also propose Group-Layer Normalization (GLN) to enhance the performance of encoding within different semantic spaces and the dynamic masking strategy to avoid information leakage. We further optimize the training frameworks, enabling support for our models with 10 to 100 times computational complexity compared to the DLRM, without significant cost increases. MTGR achieved 65x FLOPs for single-sample forward inference compared to the DLRM model, resulting in the largest gain in nearly two years both offline and online.

We propose AcuRank, an adaptive reranking framework that dynamically adjusts both the amount and target of computation based on uncertainty estimates over document relevance. Using a Bayesian TrueSkill model, we iteratively refine relevance estimates until reaching sufficient confidence levels, and our explicit modeling of ranking uncertainty enables principled control over reranking behavior and avoids unnecessary updates to confident predictions.

Existing approaches often generate a synthetic target text using large language models (LLMs) to serve as an intermediate anchor between the compositional query and the target image. Models are then trained to align the compositional query with the generated text, and separately align images with their corresponding texts using contrastive learning. However, this reliance on intermediate text introduces error propagation, as inaccuracies in query-to-text and text-to-image mappings accumulate, ultimately degrading retrieval performance. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework by employing a Multimodal Reasoning Agent (MRA) for ZS-CIR. MRA eliminates the dependence on textual intermediaries by directly constructing triplets, <reference image, modification text, target image>, using only unlabeled image data.

Crucially, it does not directly optimize the composed query representation to capture the full intent of the composition or to align with the target semantics, thereby limiting retrieval performance, particularly in cases involving fine-grained or complex visual transformations. To address this problem, we propose MLLM-Guided VLM Fine-Tuning with Joint Inference (MVFT-JI), a novel approach that leverages a pretrained multimodal large language model (MLLM) to construct two complementary training tasks using only unlabeled images: target text retrieval taskand text-to-image retrieval task. By jointly optimizing these tasks, our method enables the VLM to inherently acquire robust compositional retrieval capabilities, supported by the provided theoretical justifications and empirical validation.

The current research community consensus is that listwise ranking yields superior performance, and significant research effort has been devoted to crafting LLM listwise ranking algorithms. The underlying hypothesis is that LLMs are better at making relative relevance judgments than absolute ones. In tension with this hypothesis, we find that the gap between pointwise scoring and listwise ranking shrinks when pointwise scoring is implemented using a sufficiently large ordinal relevance label space, becoming statistically insignificant for many LLM-benchmark dataset combinations (where ``significant'' means ``95\\% confidence that listwise ranking improves NDCG@10'').

As large language models are increasingly deployed in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and personalized assistance, Federated RAG offers a promising framework for secure, knowledge-intensive natural language processing (NLP). To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first systematic mapping study of Federated RAG, covering literature published between 2020 and 2025. Following Kitchenham's guidelines for evidence-based software engineering, we develop a structured classification of research focuses, contribution types, and application domains. We analyze architectural patterns, temporal trends, and key challenges, including privacy-preserving retrieval, cross-client heterogeneity, and evaluation limitations. Our findings synthesize a rapidly evolving body of research, identify recurring design patterns, and surface open questions, providing a foundation for future work at the intersection of RAG and federated systems."}

However, there are few automated measures of student knowledge that can be readily deployed and scored in time to make predictions on whether a given student will likely be able to understand a specific content area text. In this paper, we present our effort in developing K-tool, an automated system for generating topical vocabulary tests that measure students' background knowledge related to a specific text. The system automatically detects the topic of a given text and produces topical vocabulary items based on their relationship with the topic. This information is used to automatically generate background knowledge forms that contain words that are highly related to the topic and words that share similar features but do not share high associations to the topic. Prior research indicates that performance on such tasks can help determine whether a student is likely to understand a particular text based on their knowledge state. The described system is intended for use with middle and high school student population of native speakers of English. It is designed to handle single reading passages and is not dependent on any corpus or text collection. In this paper, we describe the system architecture and present an initial evaluation of the system outputs."}

However, existing methods often neglect the rich visual semantics knowledge of entities, thus leading to incorrect retrieval results. To address this problem, we propose the Entity Visual Description enhanced CLIP (EvdCLIP), designed to leverage the visual knowledge of entities to enrich queries. Specifically, since humans recognize entities through visual cues, we employ a large language model (LLM) to generate Entity Visual Descriptions (EVDs) as alignment cues to complement textual data. These EVDs are then integrated into raw queries to create visually-rich, EVD-enhanced queries. Furthermore, recognizing that EVD-enhanced queries may introduce noise or low-quality expansions, we develop a novel, trainable EVD-aware Rewriter (EaRW) for vision-language retrieval tasks. EaRW utilizes EVD knowledge and the generative capabilities of the language model to effectively rewrite queries. With our specialized training strategy, EaRW can generate high-quality and low-noise EVD-enhanced queries. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on image-text retrieval benchmarks validate the superiority of EvdCLIP on vision-language retrieval tasks.'}

However, this integration introduces new security vulnerabilities, particularly to poisoning attacks. Although prior work has explored various poisoning strategies, a thorough assessment of their practical threat to RAG systems remains missing. To address this gap, we propose the first comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating poisoning attacks on RAG. Our benchmark covers 5 standard question answering (QA) datasets and 10 expanded variants, along with 13 poisoning attack methods and 7 defense mechanisms, representing a broad spectrum of existing techniques. Using this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all included attacks and defenses across the full dataset spectrum. Our findings show that while existing attacks perform well on standard QA datasets, their effectiveness drops significantly on the expanded versions. Moreover, our results demonstrate that various advanced RAG architectures, such as sequential, branching, conditional, and loop RAG, as well as multi-turn conversational RAG, multimodal RAG systems, and RAG-based LLM agent systems, remain susceptible to poisoning attacks. Notably, current defense techniques fail to provide robust protection, underscoring the pressing need for more resilient and generalizable defense strategies.'}

On the other hand, in LLM4DATA, LLMs are emerging as general-purpose engines for data management. We review recent advances in (i) data manipulation, including automatic data cleaning, integration, discovery; (ii) data analysis, covering reasoning over structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and (iii) system optimization (e.g., configuration tuning, query rewriting, anomaly diagnosis), powered by LLM techniques like retrieval-augmented prompting, task-specialized fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration.'}

Solanki, Abhilasha Mangal', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18247', 'abstract': "Despite the widespread exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), its deployment in enterprises for domain-specific datasets remains limited due to poor answer accuracy. These corpora, often shielded behind firewalls in private enterprise knowledge bases, having complex, domain-specific terminology, rarely seen by LLMs during pre-training; exhibit significant semantic variability across domains (like networking, military, or legal, etc.), or even within a single domain like medicine, and thus result in poor context precision for RAG systems. Currently, in such situations, fine-tuning or RAG with fine-tuning is attempted, but these approaches are slow, expensive, and lack generalization for accuracy as the new domain-specific data emerges. We propose an approach for Enterprise Search that focuses on enhancing the retriever for a domain-specific corpus through hybrid query indexes and metadata enrichment. This 'MetaGen Blended RAG' method constructs a metadata generation pipeline using key concepts, topics, and acronyms, and then creates a metadata-enriched hybrid index with boosted search queries. This approach avoids overfitting and generalizes effectively across domains. On the PubMedQA benchmark for the biomedical domain, the proposed method achieves 82% retrieval accuracy and 77% RAG accuracy, surpassing all previous RAG accuracy results without fine-tuning and sets a new benchmark for zero-shot results while outperforming much larger models like GPT3.5. The results are even comparable to the best fine-tuned models on this dataset, and we further demonstrate the robustness and scalability of the approach by evaluating it on other Q&A datasets like SQuAD, NQ etc."}

Detecting such misinformation is challenging because it requires resolving the context of the claim before checking for misinformation. Many current methods, including LLMs and LVLMs, do not perform this contextualization step. LLMs hallucinate in absence of context or parametric knowledge. In this work, we propose a graph-based method that evaluates the consistency between the image and the caption by constructing two graph representations: an evidence graph, derived from online textual evidence, and a claim graph, from the claim in the caption. Using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode and compare these representations, our framework then evaluates the truthfulness of image-caption pairs. We create datasets for our graph-based method, evaluate and compare our baseline model against popular LLMs on the misinformation detection task. Our method scores $93.05\\%$ detection accuracy on the evaluation set and outperforms the second-best performing method (an LLM) by $2.82\\%$, making a case for smaller and task-specific methods.'}
