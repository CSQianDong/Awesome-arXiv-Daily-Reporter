While effective, dense retrieval produces uninterpretable dense vectors, and suffers from the drawback of large index size. Learned sparse retrieval (LSR) has emerged as promising alternative, achieving competitive retrieval performance while also being able to leverage the classical inverted index data structure for efficient retrieval. However, limited works have explored scaling LSR beyond BERT scale. In this work, we identify two challenges in training large language models (LLM) for LSR: (1) training instability during the early stage of contrastive training; (2) suboptimal performance due to pre-trained LLM's unidirectional attention. To address these challenges, we propose two corresponding techniques: (1) a lightweight adaptation training phase to eliminate training instability; (2) two model variants to enable bidirectional information. With these techniques, we are able to train LSR models with 8B scale LLM, and achieve competitive retrieval performance with reduced index size. Furthermore, we are among the first to analyze the performance-efficiency tradeoff of LLM-based LSR model through the lens of model quantization. Our findings provide insights into adapting LLMs for efficient retrieval modeling."}

However, the main difficulty lies in balancing the inherent self-knowledge of LLMs with external information retrieval (IR). The current threshold-based methods apply one-dimensional static mechanisms with single criterion. As a result, their IR decisions might be irrelevant to the LLMs' response under difficult queries. To alleviate this problem, we propose Cognitive Convection of Self-Knowledge (CCSK). Different from traditional methods that maintain single fixed IR activation criteria, CCSK implements a dynamic joint decision process via a Siamese Network module and a Response Quality Model. The Siamese Network calculates the cosine similarity between the current query and the historical queries. The Response Quality Model evaluates the responses of LLMs through LightGBM. The final decision of the CCSK is derived from the outputs of the two modules, as well as text features fused using a multi-head attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that CCSK significantly enhances the model's effectiveness in information retrieval."}

Most existing LLM-based methods fail to sufficiently explore the multi-view graph structure correlations inherent in recommendation scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Hypergraph Enhanced LLM Learning for multimodal Recommendation (HeLLM), designed to equip LLMs with the capability to capture intricate higher-order semantic correlations by fusing graph-level contextual signals with sequence-level behavioral patterns. In the recommender pre-training phase, we design a user hypergraph to uncover shared interest preferences among users and an item hypergraph to capture correlations within multimodal similarities among items. The hypergraph convolution and synergistic contrastive learning mechanism are introduced to enhance the distinguishability of learned representations. In the LLM fine-tuning phase, we inject the learned graph-structured embeddings directly into the LLM's architecture and integrate sequential features capturing each user's chronological behavior. This process enables hypergraphs to leverage graph-structured information as global context, enhancing the LLM's ability to perceive complex relational patterns and integrate multimodal information, while also modeling local temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines, confirming the advantages of fusing hypergraph-based context with sequential user behavior in LLMs for recommendation."}

However, in legal contexts, users frequently reference norms by their labels or nicknames (e.g., Article 5 of the Constitution or Consumer Defense Code (CDC)), rather than by their content, posing challenges for traditional RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic embeddings of text. Furthermore, legal texts themselves heavily rely on explicit cross-references (e.g., "pursuant to Article 34") that function as pointers. Both scenarios pose challenges for traditional RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic embeddings of text, often failing to retrieve the necessary referenced content. This paper introduces Poly-Vector Retrieval, a method assigning multiple distinct embeddings to each legal provision: one embedding captures the content (the full text), another captures the label (the identifier or proper name), and optionally additional embeddings capture alternative denominations. Inspired by Frege\'s distinction between Sense and Reference, this poly-vector retrieval approach treats labels, identifiers and reference markers as rigid designators and content embeddings as carriers of semantic substance. Experiments on the Brazilian Federal Constitution demonstrate that Poly-Vector Retrieval significantly improves retrieval accuracy for label-centric queries and potential to resolve internal and external cross-references, without compromising performance on purely semantic queries. The study discusses philosophical and practical implications of explicitly separating reference from content in vector embeddings and proposes future research directions for applying this approach to broader legal datasets and other domains characterized by explicit reference identifiers.'}

To further alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, recent Multimodal SBR (MSBR) methods utilize simplistic pre-trained models for modality learning but have limitations in semantic richness. Considering semantic reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLM), we focus on the LLM-enhanced MSBR scenario in this paper, which leverages LLM cognition for comprehensive multimodal representation generation, to enhance downstream MSBR. Tackling this problem faces two challenges: i) how to obtain LLM cognition on both transitional patterns and inherent multimodal knowledge, ii) how to align both features into one unified LLM, minimize discrepancy while maximizing representation utility. To this end, we propose a multimodal LLM-enhanced framework TPAD, which extends a distillation paradigm to decouple and align transitional patterns for promoting MSBR. TPAD establishes parallel Knowledge-MLLM and Transfer-MLLM, where the former interprets item knowledge-reflected features and the latter extracts transition-aware features underneath sessions. A transitional pattern alignment module harnessing mutual information estimation theory unites two MLLMs, alleviating distribution discrepancy and distilling transitional patterns into modal representations.

We argue that multi-modal semantic information can enrich user preference expressions from diverse dimensions (e.g., a user preference for a certain movie may stem from its magnificent visual effects and compelling storyline). In this paper, we propose a multi-modal semantic graph prompt learning framework for CRS, named MSCRS. First, we extract textual and image features of items mentioned in the conversational contexts. Second, we capture higher-order semantic associations within different semantic modalities (collaborative, textual, and image) by constructing modality-specific graph structures.

This paper presents Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Problem Challenge (NPPC), an ever-scaling reasoning benchmark for LLMs. Specifically, the NPPC has three main modules: i) npgym, which provides a unified interface of 25 well-known NP-complete problems and can generate any number of instances with any levels of complexities, ii) npsolver: which provides a unified interface to evaluate the problem instances with both online and offline models via APIs and local deployments, respectively, and iii) npeval: which provides the comprehensive and ready-to-use tools to analyze the performances of LLMs over different problems, the number of tokens, the aha moments, the reasoning errors and the solution errors. Extensive experiments over widely-used LLMs demonstrate: i) NPPC can successfully decrease the performances of advanced LLMs' performances to below 10%, demonstrating that NPPC is uncrushable, ii) DeepSeek-R1, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and o1/o3-mini are the most powerful LLMs, where DeepSeek-R1 outperforms Claude-3.7-Sonnet and o1/o3-mini in most NP-complete problems considered, and iii) the numbers of tokens, aha moments in the advanced LLMs, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1, are observed first to increase and then decrease when the problem instances become more and more difficult.

This method generates extended knowledge graph triples representing implicit meaning, enabling systems to reason on unlabeled multimodal data regardless of the domain. We validate our work through three metaphor detection and understanding tasks across four datasets, as they require deep analogical reasoning capabilities. The results show that this integrated approach surpasses current baselines, performs better than humans in understanding visual metaphors, and enables more explainable reasoning processes, though still has inherent limitations in metaphor understanding, especially for domain-specific metaphors.

During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the teacher model and the student model to transfer more information. However, we reveal that the current white-box KD framework exhibits two limitations: a) bridging probability distributions from different output spaces will limit the similarity between the teacher model and the student model; b) this framework cannot be applied to LLMs with different vocabularies. One of the root causes for these limitations is that the distributions from the teacher and the student for KD are output by different prediction heads, which yield distributions in different output spaces and dimensions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the prediction heads of the teacher and the student models for KD. Specifically, we first introduce two projectors with ideal initialization to project the teacher/student hidden states into the student/teacher representation spaces. After this, the hidden states from different models can share the same head and unify the output spaces of the distributions. Furthermore, we develop an exact token alignment (ETA) algorithm to align the same tokens in two differently-tokenized sequences. Based on the above, our DSKD framework is a general KD framework that supports both off-policy and on-policy KD, and KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies.

Quantitative evaluation included accuracy, Macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, METEOR, BERTScore, BARTScore, and AlignScore), computed against ground-truth reasonings. Average inference time was recorded for a subset of 100 randomly selected questions. Additionally, two board-certified ophthalmologists qualitatively assessed clarity, completeness, and reasoning structure of responses to differential diagnosis questions.O1 (0.902) and DeepSeek-R1 (0.888) achieved the highest accuracy, with o1 also leading in Macro-F1 (0.900). The performance of models across the text-generation metrics varied: O3-mini excelled in ROUGE-L (0.151), o1 in METEOR (0.232), DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini tied for BERTScore (0.673), DeepSeek-R1 (-4.105) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking (-4.127) performed best in BARTScore, while o3-mini (0.181) and o1 (0.176) led AlignScore. Inference time across the models varied, with DeepSeek-R1 being slowest (40.4 seconds) and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking fastest (6.7 seconds). Qualitative evaluation revealed that DeepSeek-R1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash-Thinking tended to provide detailed and comprehensive intermediate reasoning, whereas o1 and o3-mini displayed concise and summarized justifications.'}

In this paper, we address such a challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms to generate training data sets and construct the end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs that produce parameterized quantum circuits for optimization problems. We have prepared 14,000 quantum circuits covering a substantial part of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. The fine-tuned LLMs can construct syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in the most recent OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM outperforms state-of-the-art models and that the parameters are better than random. The LLM-generated parametrized circuits and initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, \\emph{e.g.,} templates in quantum machine learning and the benchmark for compilers and hardware.'}

Towards Data-Driven Causal Discovery with LLMs', 'authors': 'Yuni Susanti, Michael F√§rber', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10936', 'abstract': "Causal discovery traditionally relies on statistical methods applied to observational data, often requiring large datasets and assumptions about underlying causal structures. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for causal discovery by providing domain expert knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively process observational data for causal discovery. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery by integrating observational data for LLM-based reasoning. Specifically, we examine whether LLMs can effectively utilize observational data through two prompting strategies: pairwise prompting and breadth first search (BFS)-based prompting. In both approaches, we incorporate the observational data directly into the prompt to assess LLMs' ability to infer causal relationships from such data. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that incorporating observational data enhances causal discovery, boosting F1 scores by up to 0.11 point using both pairwise and BFS LLM-based prompting, while outperforming traditional statistical causal discovery baseline by up to 0.52 points. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs for data-driven causal discovery, demonstrating their ability to move beyond textual metadata and effectively interpret and utilize observational data for more informed causal reasoning. Our studies lays the groundwork for future advancements toward fully LLM-driven causal discovery."}

In this work, we position fusion depth, scalability, and dedicated multimodal capacity as primary factors for effective fusion. We introduce DeepMLF, a novel multimodal language model (LM) with learnable tokens tailored toward deep fusion. DeepMLF leverages an audiovisual encoder and a pretrained decoder LM augmented with multimodal information across its layers. We append learnable tokens to the LM that: 1) capture modality interactions in a controlled fashion and 2) preserve independent information flow for each modality. These fusion tokens gather linguistic information via causal self-attention in LM Blocks and integrate with audiovisual information through cross-attention MM Blocks. Serving as dedicated multimodal capacity, this design enables progressive fusion across multiple layers, providing depth in the fusion process. Our training recipe combines modality-specific losses and language modelling loss, with the decoder LM tasked to predict ground truth polarity. Across three MSA benchmarks with varying dataset characteristics, DeepMLF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results confirm that deeper fusion leads to better performance, with optimal fusion depths (5-7) exceeding those of existing approaches. Additionally, our analysis on the number of fusion tokens reveals that small token sets ($\\sim$20) achieve optimal performance. We examine the importance of representation learning order (fusion curriculum) through audiovisual encoder initialization experiments. Our ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed fusion design and gating while providing a holistic examination of DeepMLF's scalability to LLMs, and the impact of each training objective and embedding regularization."}

However, these techniques often require lengthy prompts, which increase computational costs and can hinder performance because of the limited context windows of LLMs. While prompt compression is a straightforward solution, existing methods confront the challenges of retaining essential information, adapting to context changes, and remaining effective across different tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a task-agnostic method called Dynamic Compressing Prompts (LLM-DCP). Our method reduces the number of prompt tokens while aiming to preserve the performance as much as possible. We model prompt compression as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling the DCP-Agent to sequentially remove redundant tokens by adapting to dynamic contexts and retaining crucial content. We develop a reward function for training the DCP-Agent that balances the compression rate, the quality of the LLM output, and the retention of key information. This allows for prompt token reduction without needing an external black-box LLM. Inspired by the progressive difficulty adjustment in curriculum learning, we introduce a Hierarchical Prompt Compression (HPC) training strategy that gradually increases the compression difficulty, enabling the DCP-Agent to learn an effective compression method that maintains information integrity. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, especially at higher compression rates. The code for our approach will be available at this https URL.'}

This paper presents a novel framework for interpreting LLMs as probabilistic left context-sensitive languages (CSLs) generators. We hypothesize that Transformers can be effectively decomposed into three fundamental components: context windows, attention mechanisms, and autoregressive generation frameworks. This decomposition allows for the development of more flexible and interpretable computational models, moving beyond the traditional view of attention and autoregression as inseparable processes. We argue that next-token predictions can be understood as probabilistic, dynamic approximations of left CSL production rules, providing an intuitive explanation for how simple token predictions can yield human-like intelligence outputs. Given that all CSLs are left context-sensitive (Penttonen, 1974), we conclude that Transformers stochastically approximate CSLs, which are widely recognized as models of human-like intelligence. This interpretation bridges the gap between Formal Language Theory and the observed generative power of Transformers, laying a foundation for future advancements in generative AI theory and applications. Our novel perspective on Transformer architectures will foster a deeper understanding of LLMs and their future potentials.'}

A recent variation of QRE is where an additional input, an opaque executable containing a ground-truth query, is provided, and the goal is to non-invasively extract this specific query through only input-output examples. This variant, called Hidden Query Extraction (HQE), has a spectrum of industrial use-cases including query recovery, database security, and vendor migration. The reverse engineering (RE) tools developed for HQE, which are based on database mutation and generation techniques, can only extract flat queries with key-based equi joins and conjunctive arithmetic filter predicates, making them limited wrt both query structure and query operators. In this paper, we present Xpose, a HQE solution that elevates the extraction scope to realistic complex queries, such as those found in the TPCH benchmark. A two-pronged approach is taken: (1) The existing RE scope is substantially extended to incorporate union connectors, algebraic filter predicates, and disjunctions for both values and predicates. (2) The predictive power of LLMs is leveraged to convert business descriptions of the opaque application into extraction guidance, representing ``forward engineering" (FE). The FE module recognizes common constructs, such as nesting of sub-queries, outer joins, and scalar functions. In essence, FE establishes the broad query contours, while RE fleshes out the fine-grained details. We have evaluated Xpose on (a) E-TPCH, a query suite comprising the complete TPCH benchmark extended with queries featuring unions, diverse join types, and sub-queries; and (b) the real-world STACK benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that its bi-directional engineering approach accurately extracts these complex queries, representing a significant step forward with regard to HQE coverage.'}

To close this gap, this work first introduces CLASH (Character perspective-based LLM Assessments in Situations with High-stakes), a meticulously curated dataset consisting of 345 high-impact dilemmas along with 3,795 individual perspectives of diverse values. In particular, we design CLASH in a way to support the study of critical aspects of value-based decision-making processes which are missing from prior work, including understanding decision ambivalence and psychological discomfort as well as capturing the temporal shifts of values in characters' perspectives. By benchmarking 10 open and closed frontier models, we uncover several key findings. (1) Even the strongest models, such as GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet, achieve less than 50% accuracy in identifying situations where the decision should be ambivalent, while they perform significantly better in clear-cut scenarios. (2) While LLMs reasonably predict psychological discomfort as marked by human, they inadequately comprehend perspectives involving value shifts, indicating a need for LLMs to reason over complex values. (3) Our experiments also reveal a significant correlation between LLMs' value preferences and their steerability towards a given value.

In this paper, we present a spectral analysis of layer-wise gradients induced by low/high-quality instruction and reasoning data for LLM post-training. Our analysis reveals that widely-studied metrics for data evaluation, e.g., IFD, InsTag, Difficulty, and Reward, can be explained and unified by spectral properties computed from gradients' singular value decomposition (SVD). Specifically, higher-quality data are usually associated with lower nuclear norms and higher effective ranks. Notably, effective rank exhibits better robustness and resolution than nuclear norm in capturing subtle quality differences. For example, reasoning data achieves substantially higher effective ranks than instruction data, implying richer gradient structures on more complex tasks. Our experiments also highlight that models within the same family share similar gradient patterns regardless of their sizes, whereas different model families diverge significantly. Providing a unified view on the effects of data quality across instruction and reasoning data, this work illuminates the interplay between data quality and training stability, shedding novel insights into developing better data exploration strategies for post-training."}

Drawing on research from nonverbal communication and personality psychology, we show that brief excerpts (thin slices) reliably predict overall presentation quality. Using a novel corpus of over one hundred real-life science talks, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate transcripts of full presentations and their thin slices. By correlating LLM-based evaluations of short excerpts with full-talk assessments, we determine how much information is needed for accurate predictions. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluations align closely with human ratings, proving their validity, reliability, and efficiency. Critically, even very short excerpts (less than 10 percent of a talk) strongly predict overall evaluations. This suggests that the first moments of a presentation convey relevant information that is used in quality evaluations and can shape lasting impressions. The findings are robust across different LLMs and prompting strategies. This work extends thin-slicing research to public speaking and connects theories of impression formation to LLMs and current research on AI communication. We discuss implications for communication and social cognition research on message reception. Lastly, we suggest an LLM-based thin-slicing framework as a scalable feedback tool to enhance human communication.'}

Names also serve as powerful signals of gender, race, and status in the social hierarchy - a pecking order in which individual positions shape others' expectations on their perceived competence and worth. With the widespread adoption of LLMs and as names are often an input for LLMs, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs may sort people into status positions based on first and last names and, if so, whether it is in an unfair, biased fashion. While prior work has primarily investigated biases in first names, little attention has been paid to last names and even less to the combined effects of first and last names. In this study, we conduct a large-scale analysis of name variations across 5 ethnicities to examine how AI exhibits name biases. Our study investigates three key characteristics of inequality and finds that LLMs reflect and reinforce status hierarchies based on names that signal gender and ethnicity as they encode differential expectations of competence, leadership, and economic potential. Contrary to the common assumption that AI tends to favor Whites, we show that East and, in some contexts, South Asian names receive higher rankings. We also disaggregate Asians, a population projected to be the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by 2055. Our results challenge the monolithic Asian model minority assumption, illustrating a more complex and stratified model of bias. Gender moderates biases, with girls facing unfair disadvantages in certain racial groups. Additionally, spanning cultural categories by adopting Western first names improves AI-perceived status for East and Southeast Asian students, particularly for girls. Our findings underscore the importance of intersectional and more nuanced understandings of race, gender, and mixed identities in the evaluation of LLMs."}

This paper introduces CleanMAP, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based distillation framework designed to filter and refine crowdsourced data for high-confidence HD map updates. CleanMAP leverages an MLLM-driven lane visibility scoring model that systematically quantifies key visual parameters, assigning confidence scores (0-10) based on their impact on lane detection. A novel dynamic piecewise confidence-scoring function adapts scores based on lane visibility, ensuring strong alignment with human evaluations while effectively filtering unreliable data. To further optimize map accuracy, a confidence-driven local map fusion strategy ranks and selects the top-k highest-scoring local maps within an optimal confidence range (best score minus 10%), striking a balance between data quality and quantity. Experimental evaluations on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset validate CleanMAP's effectiveness, demonstrating that fusing the top three local maps achieves the lowest mean map update error of 0.28m, outperforming the baseline (0.37m) and meeting stringent accuracy thresholds (<= 0.32m).

Results from user surveys highlight the preference for AI powered mediums over existing methods to help in travel planning across all user age groups. These results firmly validate the potential need of such a travel assistant. We highlight the two primary design considerations for travel assistance: D1) incorporating a web-scraping method to gather up-to-date news articles about destinations from various blog sources, which significantly improves our itinerary suggestions, and D2) utilising user preferences to create customised travel experiences along with a recommendation system which changes the itinerary according to the user needs. Our findings suggest that Roamify has the potential to improve and simplify how users across multiple age groups plan their travel experiences.'}

Chen, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11420', 'abstract': "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across numerous tasks, yet they often rely on external context to handle complex tasks. While retrieval-augmented frameworks traditionally focus on selecting top-ranked documents in a single pass, many real-world scenarios demand compositional retrieval, where multiple sources must be combined in a coordinated manner. In this work, we propose a tri-encoder sequential retriever that models this process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), decomposing the probability of retrieving a set of elements into a sequence of conditional probabilities and allowing each retrieval step to be conditioned on previously selected examples. We train the retriever in two stages: first, we efficiently construct supervised sequential data for initial policy training; we then refine the policy to align with the LLM's preferences using a reward grounded in the structural correspondence of generated programs. Experimental results show that our method consistently and significantly outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling inter-example dependencies. These findings highlight the potential of compositional retrieval for tasks requiring multiple pieces of evidence or examples."}

However, current medical benchmarks focus on medical exams or consumer-searched questions and do not evaluate LLMs on real patient questions with detailed clinical contexts. In this paper, we first evaluate LLMs on cancer-related questions drawn from real patients, reviewed by three hematology oncology physicians. While responses are generally accurate, with GPT-4-Turbo scoring 4.13 out of 5, the models frequently fail to recognize or address false presuppositions in the questions-posing risks to safe medical decision-making. To study this limitation systematically, we introduce Cancer-Myth, an expert-verified adversarial dataset of 585 cancer-related questions with false presuppositions. On this benchmark, no frontier LLM -- including GPT-4o, this http URL, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet -- corrects these false presuppositions more than 30% of the time. Even advanced medical agentic methods do not prevent LLMs from ignoring false presuppositions. These findings expose a critical gap in the clinical reliability of LLMs and underscore the need for more robust safeguards in medical AI systems.'}

One key limitation is their inconsistency at reporting the the same information when prompts are changed. In this paper, we consider the discrepancy between a model's generated answer and their own verification of that answer, the generator-validator gap. We define this gap in a more stringent way than prior work: we expect correlation of scores from a generator and a validator over the entire set of candidate answers. We show that according to this measure, a large gap exists in various settings, including question answering, lexical semantics tasks, and next-word prediction. We then propose RankAlign, a ranking-based training method, and show that it significantly closes the gap by 31.8% on average, surpassing all baseline methods. Moreover, this approach generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks and lexical items."}

Existing methods focus on correcting the output, but they often overlook the potential of improving the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading content in the input itself. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination detection task and the question answering (QA) task, as well as two datasets containing misleading information that we constructed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and factuality of LLM responses, while also enhancing the ability to detect hallucinations and reducing the generation of hallucinations in the output, particularly when the query contains misleading information. We will publicly release our code upon acceptance.'}

Our experiments with Stable Diffusion XL, 3.5 and Flux demonstrate that LLM-modified prompts significantly increase image diversity and reduce bias without the need to change the image generators themselves. While occasionally producing results that diverge from original user intent for elaborate prompts, this approach generally provides more varied interpretations of underspecified requests rather than superficial variations.

This incentivizes the LLM to explore alternative queries rather than prematurely halting. ReZero demonstrates significant improvement, achieving 46.88% accuracy compared to a 25% baseline. By rewarding persistence, ReZero enhances LLM robustness in complex information-seeking scenarios where initial queries may prove insufficient.'}

To bridge this gap, we are the first to explore a knowledge graph-based (KG) RAG framework for Japanese medical QA small-scale open-source LLMs. Experimental results show that KG-based RAG has only a limited impact on Japanese medical QA using small-scale open-source LLMs. Further case studies reveal that the effectiveness of the RAG is sensitive to the quality and relevance of the external retrieved content. These findings offer valuable insights into the challenges and potential of applying RAG in Japanese medical QA, while also serving as a reference for other low-resource languages.'}

Despite its importance in real-life applications, this ability has not been adequately investigated for state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we evaluate the cross-lingual context retrieval ability of over 40 LLMs across 12 languages to understand the source of this ability, using cross-lingual machine reading comprehension (xMRC) as a representative scenario. Our results show that several small, post-trained open LLMs show strong cross-lingual context retrieval ability, comparable to closed-source LLMs such as GPT-4o, and their estimated oracle performances greatly improve after post-training. Our interpretability analysis shows that the cross-lingual context retrieval process can be divided into two main phases: question encoding and answer retrieval, which are formed in pre-training and post-training, respectively. The phasing stability correlates with xMRC performance, and the xMRC bottleneck lies at the last model layers in the second phase, where the effect of post-training can be evidently observed. Our results also indicate that larger-scale pretraining cannot improve the xMRC performance. Instead, larger LLMs need further multilingual post-training to fully unlock their cross-lingual context retrieval potential. Our code and is available at this https URL'}

Existing routing strategies partially alleviate this challenge by assigning queries to cheaper or specialized models, but they frequently rely on extensive labeled data or fragile task-specific heuristics. Conversely, fusion techniques aggregate multiple LLM outputs to boost accuracy and robustness, yet they often exacerbate cost and may reinforce shared biases.\nWe introduce EMAFusion, a new framework that self-optimizes for seamless LLM selection and reliable execution for a given query. Specifically, EMAFusion integrates a taxonomy-based router for familiar query types, a learned router for ambiguous inputs, and a cascading approach that progressively escalates from cheaper to more expensive models based on multi-judge confidence evaluations. Through extensive evaluations, we find EMAFusion outperforms the best individual models by over 2.6 percentage points (94.3% vs. 91.7%), while being 4X cheaper than the average cost. EMAFusion further achieves a remarkable 17.1 percentage point improvement over models like GPT-4 at less than 1/20th the cost. Our combined routing approach delivers 94.3% accuracy compared to taxonomy-based (88.1%) and learned model predictor-based (91.7%) methods alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified strategy. Finally, EMAFusion supports flexible cost-accuracy trade-offs, allowing users to balance their budgetary constraints and performance needs.'}

Typically, gains in one metric is accompanied with degradation in others. Early-Exit LLMs (EE-LLMs) efficiently navigate this trade-off space by skipping some of the later model layers when it confidently finds an output token early, thus reducing latency without impacting accuracy. However, as the early exits taken depend on the task and are unknown apriori to request processing, EE-LLMs conservatively load the entire model, limiting resource savings and throughput. Also, current frameworks statically select a model for a user task, limiting our ability to adapt to changing nature of the input queries.\nWe propose HELIOS to address these challenges. First, HELIOS shortlists a set of candidate LLMs, evaluates them using a subset of prompts, gathering telemetry data in real-time. Second, HELIOS uses the early exit data from these evaluations to greedily load the selected model only up to a limited number of layers. This approach yields memory savings which enables us to process more requests at the same time, thereby improving throughput. Third, HELIOS monitors and periodically reassesses the performance of the candidate LLMs and if needed, switches to another model that can service incoming queries more efficiently (such as using fewer layers without lowering accuracy). Our evaluations show that HELIOS achieves 1.48$\\times$ throughput, 1.10$\\times$ energy-efficiency, 1.39$\\times$ lower response time, and 3.7$\\times$ improvements in inference batch sizes compared to the baseline, when optimizing for the respective service level objectives.'}

Significant progress in enhancing reasoning abilities has been made by scaling test-time compute. However, understanding and quantifying model-internal reasoning abilities - the inferential "leaps" models make between individual token predictions - remains crucial. This study introduces a benchmark (n = 4,000 items) designed to quantify model-internal reasoning in different domains. We achieve this by having LLMs indicate the correct solution to reasoning problems not through descriptive text, but by selecting a specific language of their initial response token that is different from English, the benchmark language. This not only requires models to reason beyond their context window, but also to overrise their default tendency to respond in the same language as the prompt, thereby posing an additional cognitive strain. We evaluate a set of 18 LLMs, showing significant performance variations, with GPT-4.5 achieving the highest accuracy (74.7%), outperforming models like Grok-2 (67.2%), and Llama 3.1 405B (65.6%). Control experiments and difficulty scaling analyses suggest that while LLMs engage in internal reasoning, we cannot rule out heuristic exploitations under certain conditions, marking an area for future investigation. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can "think" via latent-space computations, revealing model-internal inference strategies that need further understanding, especially regarding safety-related concerns such as covert planning, goal-seeking, or deception emerging without explicit token traces.'}

It does so by perceiving and interpreting the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) of relevant apps, often visually, inferring necessary sequences of actions, and then interacting with GUIs by executing the actions such as clicking, typing, and tapping. To complete real-world tasks, such as filling forms or booking services, GUI agents often need to process and act on sensitive user data. However, this autonomy introduces new privacy and security risks. Adversaries can inject malicious content into the GUIs that alters agent behaviors or induces unintended disclosures of private information. These attacks often exploit the discrepancy between visual saliency for agents and human users, or the agent's limited ability to detect violations of contextual integrity in task automation. In this paper, we characterized six types of such attacks, and conducted an experimental study to test these attacks with six state-of-the-art GUI agents, 234 adversarial webpages, and 39 human participants. Our findings suggest that GUI agents are highly vulnerable, particularly to contextually embedded threats. Moreover, human users are also susceptible to many of these attacks, indicating that simple human oversight may not reliably prevent failures. This misalignment highlights the need for privacy-aware agent design. We propose practical defense strategies to inform the development of safer and more reliable GUI agents."}

A super agent has the potential to fulfill diverse user needs, such as summarization, coding, and research, by accurately understanding user intent and leveraging the appropriate tools to solve tasks. However, to make such an agent viable for real-world deployment and accessible at scale, significant optimizations are required to ensure high efficiency and low cost. This paper presents a design of the Super Agent System. Upon receiving a user prompt, the system first detects the intent of the user, then routes the request to specialized task agents with the necessary tools or automatically generates agentic workflows. In practice, most applications directly serve as AI assistants on edge devices such as phones and robots. As different language models vary in capability and cloud-based models often entail high computational costs, latency, and privacy concerns, we then explore the hybrid mode where the router dynamically selects between local and cloud models based on task complexity. Finally, we introduce the blueprint of an on-device super agent enhanced with cloud. With advances in multi-modality models and edge hardware, we envision that most computations can be handled locally, with cloud collaboration only as needed. Such architecture paves the way for super agents to be seamlessly integrated into everyday life in the near future.'}

To answer this, we conducted a series of pre-registered randomized controlled experiments, where participants read LLM-generated, human-written, or no responses to help seeking OUD-related content in online communities. The experiment was conducted under two setups, i.e., participants read the responses either once (N = 2,141), or repeatedly for 14 days (N = 107). We found that participants reported the least stigmatized attitudes toward MAT after consuming LLM-generated responses under both the setups. This study offers insights into strategies that can foster inclusive online discourse on OUD, e.g., based on our findings LLMs can be used as an education-based intervention to promote positive attitudes and increase people's propensity toward MAT."}
