{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2512.07515', 'title': 'SPAD: Seven-Source Token Probability Attribution with Syntactic Aggregation for Detecting Hallucinations in RAG', 'authors': 'Pengqian Lu, Jie Lu, Anjin Liu, Guangquan Zhang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07515', 'abstract': "Detecting hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) remains a challenge. Prior approaches attribute hallucinations to a binary conflict between internal knowledge (stored in FFNs) and retrieved context. However, this perspective is incomplete, failing to account for the impact of other components in the generative process, such as the user query, previously generated tokens, the current token itself, and the final LayerNorm adjustment. To address this, we introduce SPAD. First, we mathematically attribute each token's probability into seven distinct sources: Query, RAG, Past, Current Token, FFN, Final LayerNorm, and Initial Embedding. This attribution quantifies how each source contributes to the generation of the current token. Then, we aggregate these scores by POS tags to quantify how different components drive specific linguistic categories. By identifying anomalies, such as Nouns relying on Final LayerNorm, SPAD effectively detects hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPAD achieves state-of-the-art performance"}

However, standard RAG architectures suffer from a critical vulnerability: Retrieval Sycophancy. When presented with a query based on a false premise or a common misconception, vector-based retrievers tend to fetch documents that align with the user\'s bias rather than objective truth, leading the model to "hallucinate with citations."\nIn this work, we introduce Falsification-Verification Alignment RAG (FVA-RAG), a framework that shifts the retrieval paradigm from Inductive Verification (seeking support) to Deductive Falsification (seeking disproof). Unlike existing "Self-Correction" methods that rely on internal consistency, FVA-RAG deploys a distinct Adversarial Retrieval Policy that actively generates "Kill Queries"-targeted search terms designed to surface contradictory evidence. We introduce a dual-verification mechanism that explicitly weighs the draft answer against this "Anti-Context." Preliminary experiments on a dataset of common misconceptions demonstrate that FVA-RAG significantly improves robustness against sycophantic hallucinations compared to standard RAG baselines, effectively acting as an inference-time "Red Team" for factual generation.'}

Generating SFCs is challenging due to graphical nature and ST actions embedded within, which are not directly compatible with standard generation techniques, often leading to non-executable code that is incompatible with industrial tool-chains In this work, we introduce LLM4SFC, the first framework to receive natural-language descriptions of industrial workflows and provide executable SFCs. LLM4SFC is based on three components: (i) A reduced structured representation that captures essential topology and in-line ST and reduced textual verbosity; (ii) Fine-tuning and few-shot retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for alignment with SFC programming conventions; and (iii) A structured generation approach that prunes illegal tokens in real-time to ensure compliance with the textual format of SFCs. We evaluate LLM4SFC on a dataset of real-world SFCs from automated manufacturing projects, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs. The results show that LLM4SFC reliably generates syntactically valid SFC programs effectively bridging graphical and textual PLC languages, achieving a generation generation success of 75% - 94%, paving the way for automated industrial programming.'}

Existing solutions for extracting relevant content are inadequate: generative extraction models suffer from high latency, rule-based heuristics lack adaptability, and chunk-and-rerank methods are blind to webpage structure. To overcome these issues, we introduce Index-based Web Content Extraction to reframe the extraction process from slow, token-by-token generation into a highly efficient, discriminative task of index prediction, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency. We partition HTML into structure-aware, addressable segments, and extract only the positional indices of content relevant to a given query. This method decouples extraction latency from content length, enabling rapid, query-relevant extraction. We first evaluate our method as a post-retrieval processing component within an RAG QA system and find that it improves QA accuracy. Then we directly measure its match rate with the target content in two scenarios: main content extraction (ME) and query-relevant extraction (QE). Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing works in both accuracy and speed, effectively bridging the gap between LLMs and the vast webpages.'}

This paper reviews how artificial intelligence (AI) applications can modernize Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows by improving detection accuracy, lowering false-positive rates, and reducing the operational burden of manual investigations, thereby supporting more sustainable development. It further highlights future research directions including federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration, fairness-aware and interpretable AI, reinforcement learning for adaptive defenses, and human-in-the-loop visualization systems to ensure that next-generation AML architectures remain transparent, accountable, and robust. In the final part, the paper proposes an AI-driven KYC application that integrates graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG Graph) with generative models to enhance efficiency, transparency, and decision support in KYC processes related to money-laundering detection. Experimental results show that the RAG-Graph architecture delivers high faithfulness and strong answer relevancy across diverse evaluation settings, thereby enhancing the efficiency and transparency of KYC CDD/EDD workflows and contributing to more sustainable, resource-optimized compliance practices.'}
