Current approaches primarily follow two paradigms:discrete optimization of text prompts through prompt engineering, or continuous adaptation via additional trainable parameters. Both exhibit limitations-discrete methods lack refinement precision while parameter-based techniques increase complexity and reduce interpretability. To address these constraints, we propose EmbedGrad, a novel framework that optimizes text prompt embeddings through gradient-based refinement. Our approach uniquely decouples training from deployment:during optimization,labeled examples guide precise embedding adjustments while preserving semantic meaning; during inference, only optimized embeddings integrate with user queries. This enables fine-grained calibration impossible in text space, such as enhancing the reasoning capability of prompts like please reason step by step. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, sentiment analysis, and causal judgment tasks demonstrate EmbedGrad's effectiveness:optimizing this reasoning prompt for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B increased accuracy from 14.74\\% to 58.96\\% on mathematical problems. Consistent improvements were observed across model scales (0.5B-14B) and all tasks, with particularly significant gains for smaller models on complex problems like causal judgment. By bridging prompt engineering and parameter efficiency without architectural changes, our work establishes embedding refinement as a powerful new paradigm for task adaptation."}

However, improving its alignment with human preferences without complex prompts or fine-tuning remains challenging. In this work, motivated by preliminary findings that middle-to-upper layers encode semantically and taskrelevant representations that are often more aligned with human judgments than the final layer, we propose LAGER, a lightweight and efficient framework for enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge alignment with human scoring, via internal representations. LAGER produces fine-grained judgment scores by aggregating cross-layer scoretoken logits and computing the expected score from a softmax-based distribution, with the LLM backbone kept frozen. LAGER fully leverages the complementary information across different layers, overcoming the limitations of relying solely on the final layer. We evaluate our method on the standard alignment benchmarks Flask, HelpSteer, and BIGGen using Spearman correlation, and find that LAGER achieves improvements of up to 7.5% over the best baseline across these benchmarks. Without reasoning steps, LAGER matches or outperforms reasoning-based methods. Experiments on downstream applications, such as data selection and emotional understanding, further show the effectiveness of our method.'}

Recent advancements aim to address this limitation by enabling large language models (LLMs) to generate soft, abstract tokens, thus facilitating reasoning within a continuous concept space. This paper explores the `Soft Thinking' capabilities of various LLMs by examining the models' internal behavior using a suite of probing techniques. Contrary to the common belief that Soft Thinking enables the simultaneous exploration of diverse reasoning paths, our findings reveal that LLMs predominantly rely on the most influential component of the soft inputs during subsequent decoding steps. This reliance hinders the exploration of different reasoning paths and reduces vanilla Soft Thinking to a form of greedy decoding, obscuring the advantage of transmitting more information through Soft Tokens. To tackle this issue, we explore sampling strategies to introduce \\emph{randomness}, employing methods such as Dirichlet resampling and the Gumbel-Softmax trick. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating randomness can alleviate the limitations of vanilla approaches and unleash the potential of Soft Thinking. Notably, the Gumbel-Softmax trick provides adequate randomness with controlled smoothness, resulting in superior performance across eight reasoning benchmarks."}

While prior research has primarily focused on improving their training and inference strategies, their potential for in-context learning (ICL) remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we propose Thinking with Nothinking Calibration (JointThinking), a new ICL paradigm that leverages the structured difference between two reasoning modes, i.e., Thinking and Nothinking, to improve reasoning accuracy. Specifically, our method prompts the model to generate two answers in parallel: one in Thinking mode and the other in Nothinking mode. A second round of Thinking is triggered only when the two initial responses are inconsistent, using a single prompt that incorporates the original question and both candidate answers. Since such disagreement occurs infrequently (e.g., only 6\\% in GSM8K), our method performs just one round of reasoning in most cases, resulting in minimal latency overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that JointThinking significantly outperforms few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and majority voting with improved answer robustness. Moreover, It achieves comparable in-distribution performance to training-based SOTA method, while substantially outperforming on out-of-distribution tasks. We further conduct a systematic analysis of the calibration mechanism, showing that leveraging different reasoning modes consistently lowers the error rate and highlights the value of structural thinking diversity. Additionally, we observe that the performance gap between actual and ideal reasoning narrows as model size increases in the second round of thinking, indicating the strong scalability of our approach. Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising directions for future ICL research in RLLMs.'}

Prior research has often probed gender bias using explicit gender cues as counterfactual, or studied them in sentence completion and short question answering tasks. These formats might overlook more implicit forms of bias embedded in generative behavior of longer content. In this work, we investigate gender bias in LLMs using gender stereotypes studied in psychology (e.g., aggressiveness or gossiping) in an open-ended task of narrative generation. We introduce a novel dataset called StereoBias-Stories containing short stories either unconditioned or conditioned on (one, two, or six) random attributes from 25 psychological stereotypes and three task-related story endings. We analyze how the gender contribution in the overall story changes in response to these attributes and present three key findings: (1) While models, on average, are highly biased towards male in unconditioned prompts, conditioning on attributes independent from gender stereotypes mitigates this bias. (2) Combining multiple attributes associated with the same gender stereotype intensifies model behavior, with male ones amplifying bias and female ones alleviating it. (3) Model biases align with psychological ground-truth used for categorization, and alignment strength increases with model size. Together, these insights highlight the importance of psychology-grounded evaluation of LLMs.'}

To answer this, we systematically compare model completions of exisiting dialogues to the original human responses across sixteen language models, three dialogue corpora, and a variety of stylometric features. We find that models strongly converge to the conversation's style, often significantly overfitting relative to the human baseline. While convergence patterns are often feature-specific, we observe consistent shifts in convergence across modeling settings, with instruction-tuned and larger models converging less than their pretrained counterparts. Given the differences between human and model convergence patterns, we hypothesize that the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are very different."}

Our analysis pinpoints two key reasons for this failure: the models' low sensitivity to cultural personas and a strong, culturally invariant symptom hierarchy that overrides cultural cues.

To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth analysis of structural probes on three controlled benchmarks. Our results are three-fold. First, structural probes are biased by a superficial property: the closer two words are in a sentence, the more likely structural probes will consider them as syntactically linked. Second, structural probes are challenged by linguistic properties: they poorly represent deep syntactic structures, and get interfered by interacting nouns or ungrammatical verb forms. Third, structural probes do not appear to be affected by the predictability of individual words. Overall, this work sheds light on the current challenges faced by structural probes.

On the other hand, recent works demonstrate that collective-agent methods can break through the upper bound of single-agent systems by orchestrating diverse models. Thus, in this paper, we take a first step towards exploring Collective Test-Time Scaling (CTTS). Consider the different interaction types of single and multiple models, we design three primary paradigms to investigate the optimal paradigm of CTTS: (1) single agent to multiple reward models (SA-MR); (2) multiple agents to single reward model (MA-SR); and (3) multiple agents to multiple reward models (MA-MR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-MR consistently achieves the best performance. Based on this, we propose a novel framework named CTTS-MM that effectively leverages both multi-agent and multi-reward-model collaboration for enhanced inference. Specifically, for multi-agent collaboration, we propose an Agent Collaboration Search (ACS), which searches for the most effective combination of LLM agents from a large candidate pool; for multi-reward-model collaboration, we propose Mixture of Reword Models (MoR), which consists of a curated question pool and a Prior Reward model Ensemble Selection (PRES) to select the optimal combinations of reward models via Pair-wise Reward Ranking (PRR) metric.

To mitigate this issue, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to enable rigorous reasoning processes involving preview and self-checking, essential for satisfying strict instruction constraints. Specifically, we first generate instructions with complex constraints and apply a filtering process to obtain valid prompts, resulting in three distinct prompt datasets categorized as hard, easy, and pass. Then, we employ rejection sampling on the pass prompts to curate a small yet high-quality dataset, enabling a cold-start initialization of the model and facilitating its adaptation to effective reasoning patterns. Subsequently, we employ an entropy-preserving supervised fine-tuning (Entropy-SFT) strategy coupled with token-wise entropy-adaptive (TEA-RL) reinforcement learning guided by rule-based dense rewards. This approach encourages the model to transform its reasoning mechanism, ultimately fostering generalizable reasoning abilities that encompass preview and self-checking.

However, this integration brings new security vulnerabilities: the risk that malicious content in the external database can be retrieved and used to manipulate model outputs. Although prior work has explored attacks on RAG systems, existing approaches either rely heavily on access to the retriever or fail to jointly consider both retrieval and generation stages, limiting their effectiveness, particularly in black-box scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose Token-level Precise Attack on the RAG (TPARAG), a novel framework that targets both white-box and black-box RAG systems. TPARAG leverages a lightweight white-box LLM as an attacker to generate and iteratively optimize malicious passages at the token level, ensuring both retrievability and high attack success in generation.

Built upon LLaVA-1.6-34B and trained on a novel Multimodal Daily Activity Reasoning (MDAR) dataset, CMRF achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on challenging benchmarks like VCR, A-OKVQA, and DailyLife-MRC. It attains an average accuracy of 69.4%, surpassing the best open-source baseline by +2.4 percentage points, with particular strength in complex reasoning scenarios. Extensive ablation studies and human evaluations confirm the critical contributions of each module and the effectiveness of iterative refinement in fostering more coherent and accurate reasoning.'}

Previous research has addressed this challenge through outline-based generation, which employs a multi-stage method for generating outlines into stories. However, this approach suffers from two common issues: almost inevitable theme drift caused by the loss of memory of previous outlines, and tedious plots with incoherent logic that are less appealing to human readers.\nIn this paper, we propose the multi-agent Story Generator structure to improve the multi-stage method, using large language models~(LLMs) as the core components of agents. To avoid theme drift, we introduce a memory storage model comprising two components: a long-term memory storage that identifies the most important memories, thereby preventing theme drift; and a short-term memory storage that retains the latest outlines from each generation round. To incorporate engaging elements into the story, we design a story theme obstacle framework based on literary narratology theory that introduces uncertain factors and evaluation criteria to generate outline. This framework calculates the similarity of the former storyline and enhances the appeal of the story by building a knowledge graph and integrating new node content. Additionally, we establish a multi-agent interaction stage to simulate writer-reader interaction through dialogue and revise the story text according to feedback, to ensure it remains consistent and logical. Evaluations against previous methods demonstrate that our approach can generate higher-quality long stories.'}

However, the integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative, introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source scenarios. \\textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in this https URL.'}

These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that requires more sophisticated matching techniques.'}

We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models.

Such noise may cause models to lose attention on key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy optimization in noisy real-world environments."}

This work first investigates the cause of this misalignment, which dues to bidirectional ambiguity: both user intents and coding tasks are inherently nonlinear, yet must be expressed and interpreted through linear prompts and code sequences. To address this, we propose direct intent-task matching, a new human-LLM interaction paradigm that externalizes and enables direct manipulation of the LLM understanding, i.e., the coding tasks and their relationships inferred by the LLM prior to code generation. As a proof-of-concept, this paradigm is then implemented in NeuroSync, which employs a knowledge distillation pipeline to extract LLM understanding, user intents, and their mappings, and enhances the alignment by allowing users to intuitively inspect and edit them via visualizations. We evaluate the algorithmic components of NeuroSync via technical experiments, and assess its overall usability and effectiveness via a user study (N=12). The results show that it enhances intent-task alignment, lowers cognitive effort, and improves coding efficiency.'}

Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network, performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design, model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.'}

This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving, prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.'}

Through a pipeline of large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming `quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge graph.

Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems.

In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.'}

In this paper, we propose SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third, we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.

Using the Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15 open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better, though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning ("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.

The existing AI development landscape falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery, they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training, OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\\% in text-based biology and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE).

We hypothesize that a pre-trained language model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM): an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests which are used for verification.

PentestJudge is a large language model (LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft. LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models, suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration testing task.

However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning (ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios. Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance than existing baseline methods.'}

Our research introduces WhisperInject, a two-stage adversarial audio attack framework that can manipulate state-of-the-art audio language models to generate harmful content. Our method uses imperceptible perturbations in audio inputs that remain benign to human listeners. The first stage uses a novel reward-based optimization method, Reinforcement Learning with Projected Gradient Descent (RL-PGD), to guide the target model to circumvent its own safety protocols and generate harmful native responses. This native harmful response then serves as the target for Stage 2, Payload Injection, where we use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to optimize subtle perturbations that are embedded into benign audio carriers, such as weather queries or greeting messages. Validated under the rigorous StrongREJECT, LlamaGuard, as well as Human Evaluation safety evaluation framework, our experiments demonstrate a success rate exceeding 86% across Qwen2.5-Omni-3B, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, and Phi-4-Multimodal.

Recent machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale. To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO) terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with physiological responses, as shown in case study.

This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.\nUsing randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.\nThese findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument reception.

To address this, we introduce the Source Code Agent framework, a new paradigm built on the "Blueprint First, Model Second" philosophy. Our framework decouples the workflow logic from the generative model.

Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines, enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves adaptability in dynamic scenarios.
