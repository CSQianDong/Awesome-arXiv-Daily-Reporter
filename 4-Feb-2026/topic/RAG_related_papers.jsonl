Abstraction is essential for scaling agent memory, yet it often comes at the cost of specificity, obscuring the fine-grained details required for effective reasoning. We introduce Memora, a harmonic memory representation that structurally balances abstraction and specificity. Memora organizes information via its primary abstractions that index concrete memory values and consolidate related updates into unified memory entries, while cue anchors expand retrieval access across diverse aspects of the memory and connect related memories. Building on this structure, we employ a retrieval policy that actively exploits these memory connections to retrieve relevant information beyond direct semantic similarity. Theoretically, we show that standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graph (KG)-based memory systems emerge as special cases of our framework. Empirically, Memora establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks, demonstrating better retrieval relevance and reasoning effectiveness as memory scales.'}

A key reason is that retrievers and rerankers optimize solely for relevance, often selecting either trivial, answer-revealing passages or evidence that lacks the critical information required to answer the question, without considering whether the evidence is suitable for the generator. We propose BAR-RAG, which reframes the reranker as a boundary-aware evidence selector that targets the generator's Goldilocks Zone -- evidence that is neither trivially easy nor fundamentally unanswerable for the generator, but is challenging yet sufficient for inference and thus provides the strongest learning signal. BAR-RAG trains the selector with reinforcement learning using generator feedback, and adopts a two-stage pipeline that fine-tunes the generator under the induced evidence distribution to mitigate the distribution mismatch between training and inference. Experiments on knowledge-intensive question answering benchmarks show that BAR-RAG consistently improves end-to-end performance under noisy retrieval, achieving an average gain of 10.3 percent over strong RAG and reranking baselines while substantially improving robustness.

We address this by constructing a comprehensive Turkish RAG dataset derived from Turkish Wikipedia and CulturaX, comprising question-answer pairs and relevant passage chunks. We benchmark seven stages of the RAG pipeline, from query transformation and reranking to answer refinement, without task-specific fine-tuning. Our results show that complex methods like HyDE maximize accuracy (85%) that is considerably higher than the baseline (78.70%). Also a Pareto-optimal configuration using Cross-encoder Reranking and Context Augmentation achieves comparable performance (84.60%) with much lower cost. We further demonstrate that over-stacking generative modules can degrade performance by distorting morphological cues, whereas simple query clarification with robust reranking offers an effective solution.'}

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external corpora, its effectiveness is limited by fragmented information in unstructured domain documents. Graph-augmented RAG (GraphRAG) emerged to enhance contextual reasoning through structured knowledge graphs, yet paradoxically underperforms vanilla RAG in real-world scenarios, exhibiting significant accuracy drops and prohibitive latency despite gains on complex queries. We identify the rigid application of GraphRAG to all queries, regardless of complexity, as the root cause. To resolve this, we propose an efficient and adaptive GraphRAG framework called EA-GraphRAG that dynamically integrates RAG and GraphRAG paradigms through syntax-aware complexity analysis. Our approach introduces: (i) a syntactic feature constructor that parses each query and extracts a set of structural features; (ii) a lightweight complexity scorer that maps these features to a continuous complexity score; and (iii) a score-driven routing policy that selects dense RAG for low-score queries, invokes graph-based retrieval for high-score queries, and applies complexity-aware reciprocal rank fusion to handle borderline cases. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark, consisting of two single-hop and two multi-hop QA benchmarks, demonstrate that our EA-GraphRAG significantly improves accuracy, reduces latency, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in handling mixed scenarios involving both simple and complex queries.'}

In this work, we first carefully analyze each component of the RAG system and propose practical alternatives for each component. Then, we conduct systematic evaluations on three types of tasks, revealing the best practices for improving the RAG system and how LLM-based RAG systems make trade-offs between performance and efficiency.'}

However, existing RAG systems fail to leverage these capabilities. They still rely on two paradigms: (1) designing an algorithm that retrieves passages in a single shot and concatenates them into the model's input, or (2) predefining a workflow and prompting the model to execute it step-by-step. Neither paradigm allows the model to participate in retrieval decisions, preventing efficient scaling with model improvements. In this paper, we introduce A-RAG, an Agentic RAG framework that exposes hierarchical retrieval interfaces directly to the model. A-RAG provides three retrieval tools: keyword search, semantic search, and chunk read, enabling the agent to adaptively search and retrieve information across multiple granularities. Experiments on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks show that A-RAG consistently outperforms existing approaches with comparable or lower retrieved tokens, demonstrating that A-RAG effectively leverages model capabilities and dynamically adapts to different RAG tasks. We further systematically study how A-RAG scales with model size and test-time compute. We will release our code and evaluation suite to facilitate future research.

Building on GraphRAG, we construct a domain-specific knowledge graph and retrieve query-relevant subgraphs to provide relational evidence during answer generation. The framework adopts ChatGLM as the Transformer backbone with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and employs a graph neural network to learn node representations that capture symptom-disease-treatment dependencies. By explicitly modeling diseases, symptoms, pesticides, and control measures as linked entities, the system supports evidence-aware retrieval beyond surface-level text similarity. Retrieved graph evidence is incorporated into the LLM input to guide generation toward domain-consistent recommendations and to mitigate hallucinated or inappropriate treatments. Experimental results show consistent improvements over text-only baselines, with the largest gains observed on multi-hop and comparative reasoning questions that require chaining multiple relations.'}
