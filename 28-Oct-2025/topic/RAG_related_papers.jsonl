However, poor translation quality degrades response generation performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages (Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability. This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.'}

Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and, critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3 points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.'}

From assisting developers in coding activities to providing conversational agents that answer newcomers' questions. In collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation, this study evaluates the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in assisting developers within the Mozilla Firefox project. We conducted an empirical analysis comparing responses from human developers, a standard GPT model, and a GPT model enhanced with RAG, using real queries from Mozilla's developer chat rooms. To ensure a rigorous evaluation, Mozilla experts assessed the responses based on helpfulness, comprehensiveness, and conciseness. The results show that RAG-assisted responses were more comprehensive than human developers (62.50% to 54.17%) and almost as helpful (75.00% to 79.17%), suggesting RAG's potential to enhance developer assistance. However, the RAG responses were not as concise and often verbose. The results show the potential to apply RAG-based tools to Open Source Software (OSS) to minimize the load to core maintainers without losing answer quality. Toning down retrieval mechanisms and making responses even shorter in the future would enhance developer assistance in massive projects like Mozilla Firefox."}

We present the first proposal to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation, inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions\' value and efficiency.'}

One application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings. However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that, given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire similar efforts in other educational contexts.'}

However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning (RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.'}

However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times."}
