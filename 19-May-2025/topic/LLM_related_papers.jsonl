Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R$^3$), a method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed methods.'}

Bayan Bruss, Daniele Rosa', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10900', 'abstract': 'Interaction sparsity is the primary obstacle for recommendation systems. Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It also is found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this sparsity issue shifts the performance bottleneck to other areas in the computational pipeline. Those that focus on enriching sparse representations with connectivity data from other external sources propose methods that are resource demanding and require careful domain expert aided addition of this newly introduced data. Others that turn to Large Language Model (LLM) based recommenders will quickly encounter limitations surrounding data quality and availability. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR learns latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.'}

Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, the exploitation of the LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability produces a virtual logic graph that reveals dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, augmenting the recommendation performance. On the other hand, the user role aligns the user behavioral logic with the observed user feedback, refining our understanding of user behaviors. Additionally, we also show that the extracted user-item logic graph is empirically a general knowledge that can benefit a wide range of recommendation tasks, and conduct experiments on industrial and several public datasets as verification."}

Customer utterances are characterized by infrequent word co-occurences and high term variability, which poses significant challenges for traditional methods in specifying distinct user needs and preparing synthetic queries. To address this, we propose an agentic LLM framework for topic modeling and synthetic query generation, which accelerates the discovery and recognition of customer intents. We first apply hierarchical topic modeling and intent discovery to expand a human-curated taxonomy from 36 generic user intents to 278 granular intents, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to significantly enhance topic specificity and diversity. Next, to support newly discovered intents and address the cold start problem, we generate synthetic user query data, which augments real utterances and reduces dependency on human annotation, especially in low-resource settings. Topic model experiments show substantial improvements in coherence and relevance after topic expansion, while synthetic data experiments indicate that in-class few-shot prompting significantly improves the quality and utility of synthetic queries without compromising diversity. We also show that LLM-generated intent descriptions and keywords can effectively substitute for human-curated versions when used as context for synthetic query generation. Our research underscores the scalability and utility of LLM agents in topic modeling and highlights the strategic use of synthetic utterances to enhance dataset variability and coverage for intent recognition.

However, we uncover a surprising and previously overlooked phenomenon: explicit CoT reasoning can significantly degrade instruction-following accuracy. Evaluating 15 models on two benchmarks: IFEval (with simple, rule-verifiable constraints) and ComplexBench (with complex, compositional constraints), we consistently observe performance drops when CoT prompting is applied. Through large-scale case studies and an attention-based analysis, we identify common patterns where reasoning either helps (e.g., with formatting or lexical precision) or hurts (e.g., by neglecting simple constraints or introducing unnecessary content). We propose a metric, constraint attention, to quantify model focus during generation and show that CoT reasoning often diverts attention away from instruction-relevant tokens. To mitigate these effects, we introduce and evaluate four strategies: in-context learning, self-reflection, self-selective reasoning, and classifier-selective reasoning. Our results demonstrate that selective reasoning strategies, particularly classifier-selective reasoning, can substantially recover lost performance.

To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary, which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.'}

Prior approaches for efficient test-time scaling, typically using universal budget constraints or query-level length optimization, do not leverage historical information from previous encounters with the same problem during training. We hypothesize that this limits their ability to progressively make solutions more concise over time. To address this, we present History-Aware Policy Optimization (HAPO), which keeps track of a history state (e.g., the minimum length over previously generated correct responses) for each problem. HAPO employs a novel length reward function based on this history state to incentivize the discovery of correct solutions that are more concise than those previously found. Crucially, this reward structure avoids overly penalizing shorter incorrect responses with the goal of facilitating exploration towards more efficient solutions. By combining this length reward with a correctness reward, HAPO jointly optimizes for correctness and efficiency. We use HAPO to train DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview, and Qwen-2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and evaluate HAPO on several math benchmarks that span various difficulty levels.

Meanwhile, SoLo-RA explicitly encourages reward score consistency utilization for the responses when conditioned on both short and long contexts that contain identical task-relevant information. This facilitates transferring the model's ability to handle short contexts into long-context scenarios. SoLoPO is compatible with mainstream preference optimization algorithms, while substantially improving the efficiency of data construction and training processes.

These models leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) processes, enabling them to emulate human-like reasoning strategies. However, the advancement of LRMs is hindered by the lack of comprehensive CoT datasets. Current resources often fail to provide extensive reasoning problems with coherent CoT processes distilled from multiple teacher models and do not account for multifaceted properties describing the internal characteristics of CoTs. To address these challenges, we introduce OmniThought, a large-scale dataset featuring 2 million CoT processes generated and validated by two powerful LRMs as teacher models. Each CoT process in OmniThought is annotated with novel Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores, which describe the appropriateness of CoT verbosity and cognitive difficulty level for models to comprehend these reasoning processes. We further establish a self-reliant pipeline to curate this dataset. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5 models of various sizes demonstrate the positive impact of our proposed scores on LRM training effectiveness. Based on the proposed OmniThought dataset, we further train and release a series of high-performing LRMs, specifically equipped with stronger reasoning abilities and optimal CoT output length and difficulty level.

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities in this area. However, MLLMs often suffer from hallucinations, generating irrelevant or nonsensical content. To the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this issue, there has been no dedicated effort to evaluate emotion-related hallucinations in MLLMs. In this work, we introduce EmotionHallucer, the first benchmark for detecting and analyzing emotion hallucinations in MLLMs. Unlike humans, whose emotion understanding stems from the interplay of biology and social learning, MLLMs rely solely on data-driven learning and lack innate emotional instincts. Fortunately, emotion psychology provides a solid foundation of knowledge about human emotions. Building on this, we assess emotion hallucinations from two dimensions: emotion psychology knowledge and real-world multimodal perception. To support robust evaluation, we utilize an adversarial binary question-answer (QA) framework, which employs carefully crafted basic and hallucinated pairs to assess the emotion hallucination tendencies of MLLMs. By evaluating 38 LLMs and MLLMs on EmotionHallucer, we reveal that: i) most current models exhibit substantial issues with emotion hallucinations; ii) closed-source models outperform open-source ones in detecting emotion hallucinations, and reasoning capability provides additional advantages; iii) existing models perform better in emotion psychology knowledge than in multimodal emotion perception. As a byproduct, these findings inspire us to propose the PEP-MEK framework, which yields an average improvement of 9.90% in emotion hallucination detection across selected models.

Given a sequence of previous values, next-token prediction assigns a probability to each possible next value in the vocabulary. There are many ways to use next-token prediction to output token sequences. This paper examines a few of these algorithms (greedy, lookahead, random sampling, and temperature-scaled random sampling) and studies their consistency with respect to various goals encoded as loss functions. Although consistency of surrogate losses with respect to a target loss function is a well researched topic, we are the first to study it in the context of LLMs (to the best of our knowledge). We find that, so long as next-token prediction converges to its true probability distribution, random sampling is consistent with outputting sequences that mimic sampling from the true probability distribution. For the other goals, such as minimizing the 0-1 loss on the entire sequence, we show no polynomial-time algorithm is optimal for all probability distributions and all decoding algorithms studied are only optimal for a subset of probability distributions. When analyzing these results, we see that there is a dichotomy created between the goals of information retrieval and creative generation for the decoding algorithms. This shows that choosing the correct decoding algorithm based on the desired goal is extremely important and many of the ones used are lacking theoretical grounding in numerous scenarios.'}

In this paper, we first introduce a novel security threat, which we term the MCP Preference Manipulation Attack (MPMA). An attacker deploys a customized MCP server to manipulate LLMs, causing them to prioritize it over other competing MCP servers. This can result in economic benefits for attackers, such as revenue from paid MCP services or advertising income generated from free servers. To achieve MPMA, we first design a Direct Preference Manipulation Attack ($\\mathtt{DPMA}$) that achieves significant effectiveness by inserting the manipulative word and phrases into the tool name and description. However, such a direct modification is obvious to users and lacks stealthiness.

While existing TTS methods operate in a discrete token space by generating more intermediate steps, recent studies in Coconut and SoftCoT have demonstrated that thinking in the continuous latent space can further enhance the reasoning performance. Such latent thoughts encode informative thinking without the information loss associated with autoregressive token generation, sparking increased interest in continuous-space reasoning. Unlike discrete decoding, where repeated sampling enables exploring diverse reasoning paths, latent representations in continuous space are fixed for a given input, which limits diverse exploration, as all decoded paths originate from the same latent thought. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SoftCoT++ to extend SoftCoT to the Test-Time Scaling paradigm by enabling diverse exploration of thinking paths. Specifically, we perturb latent thoughts via multiple specialized initial tokens and apply contrastive learning to promote diversity among soft thought representations. Experiments across five reasoning benchmarks and two distinct LLM architectures demonstrate that SoftCoT++ significantly boosts SoftCoT and also outperforms SoftCoT with self-consistency scaling.

Linguists suggest that such vagueness frequently arises from referring expressions (REs), whose meanings depend heavily on dialogue context and environment. This vagueness is even more prevalent among the elderly and children, who robots should serve more. This paper studies how such vagueness in REs within human instructions affects LLM-based robot task planning and how to overcome this issue. To this end, we propose the first robot task planning benchmark with vague REs (REI-Bench), where we discover that the vagueness of REs can severely degrade robot planning performance, leading to success rate drops of up to 77.9%.

Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.'}

Explainable AI (XAI) aims to reveal the inner workings of AI systems and expose misbehaviours or biases. However, current XAI tools, built for simpler models, struggle to handle the non-numerical nature of large language models (LLMs). This paper examines the effectiveness of global XAI methods, such as rule-extraction algorithms and SHAP, in detecting bias in LLMs. To do so, we first show a text-to-ordinal mapping strategy to convert non-numerical inputs/outputs into numerical features, enabling these tools to identify (some) misinformation-related biases in LLM-generated content. Then, we inject non-linear biases of varying complexity (univariate, conjunctive, and non-convex) into widespread LLMs like ChatGPT and Llama via system instructions, using global XAI methods to detect them. This way, we found that RuleFit struggles with conjunctive and non-convex biases, while SHAP can approximate conjunctive biases but cannot express them as actionable rules. Hence, we introduce RuleSHAP, a global rule extraction algorithm combining SHAP and RuleFit to detect more non-univariate biases, improving injected bias detection over RuleFit by +94% (MRR@1) on average.'}

Contrary to conventional wisdom, empirical evidence from DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates that pure RL training focused on mathematical problem-solving can progressively enhance reasoning abilities without PRM integration, challenging the perceived necessity of process supervision. In this study, we conduct a systematic investigation of the relationship between RL training and PRM capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that problem-solving proficiency and process supervision capabilities represent complementary dimensions of reasoning that co-evolve synergistically during pure RL training. In particular, current PRMs underperform simple baselines like majority voting when applied to state-of-the-art models such as DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B. To address this limitation, we propose Self-PRM, an introspective framework in which models autonomously evaluate and rerank their generated solutions through self-reward mechanisms. Although Self-PRM consistently improves the accuracy of the benchmark (particularly with larger sample sizes), analysis exposes persistent challenges: The approach exhibits low precision (<10\\%) on difficult problems, frequently misclassifying flawed solutions as valid. These analyses underscore the need for continued RL scaling to improve reward alignment and introspective accuracy. Overall, our findings suggest that PRM may not be essential for enhancing complex reasoning, as pure RL not only improves problem-solving skills but also inherently fosters robust PRM capabilities. We hope these findings provide actionable insights for building more reliable and self-aware complex reasoning models.'}

Our Feasibility with Language Model (FLM) is a simple and effective approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to better comprehend the semantic relationships between states and objects. FLM involves querying an LLM about the feasibility of a given pair and retrieving the output logit for the positive answer. To mitigate potential misguidance of the LLM given that many of the state-object compositions are rare or completely infeasible, we observe that the in-context learning ability of LLMs is essential.

Our approach leverages the LLM's instruction-following and reasoning capability to iteratively generate and refine symbolic alpha formulas within an MCTS-driven exploration.

The internal reasoning process, i.e., thought, of behavioral trajectory significantly influences tool usage and subsequent actions but can introduce potential risks. Even minor deviations in the agent's thought may trigger cascading effects leading to irreversible safety incidents. To address the safety alignment challenges in long-horizon behavioral trajectories, we propose Thought-Aligner, a plug-in dynamic thought correction module. Utilizing a lightweight and resource-efficient model, Thought-Aligner corrects each high-risk thought on the fly before each action execution. The corrected thought is then reintroduced to the agent, ensuring safer subsequent decisions and tool interactions. Importantly, Thought-Aligner modifies only the reasoning phase without altering the underlying agent framework, making it easy to deploy and widely applicable to various agent frameworks. To train the Thought-Aligner model, we construct an instruction dataset across ten representative scenarios and simulate ReAct execution trajectories, generating 5,000 diverse instructions and more than 11,400 safe and unsafe thought pairs. The model is fine-tuned using contrastive learning techniques. Experiments across three agent safety benchmarks involving 12 different LLMs demonstrate that Thought-Aligner raises agent behavioral safety from approximately 50% in the unprotected setting to 90% on average. Additionally, Thought-Aligner maintains response latency below 100ms with minimal resource usage, demonstrating its capability for efficient deployment, broad applicability, and timely responsiveness.

Multiple reasoning agents can collaborate to raise joint reasoning quality above individual outcomes. However, such agents typically interact in a turn-based manner, trading increased latency for improved quality. In this paper, we propose Group Think--a single LLM that acts as multiple concurrent reasoning agents, or thinkers. With shared visibility into each other's partial generation progress, Group Think introduces a new concurrent-reasoning paradigm in which multiple reasoning trajectories adapt dynamically to one another at the token level. For example, a reasoning thread may shift its generation mid-sentence upon detecting that another thread is better positioned to continue. This fine-grained, token-level collaboration enables Group Think to reduce redundant reasoning and improve quality while achieving significantly lower latency. Moreover, its concurrent nature allows for efficient utilization of idle computational resources, making it especially suitable for edge inference, where very small batch size often underutilizes local~GPUs. We give a simple and generalizable modification that enables any existing LLM to perform Group Think on a local GPU. We also present an evaluation strategy to benchmark reasoning latency and empirically demonstrate latency improvements using open-source LLMs that were not explicitly trained for Group Think. We hope this work paves the way for future LLMs to exhibit more sophisticated and more efficient collaborative behavior for higher quality generation."}

GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on two challenging agent benchmarks, ALFWorld and WebShop, using Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals and achieves performance gains of > 12\\% on ALFWorld and > 9\\% on WebShop over the GRPO baseline: all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.'}

Security audits help to maintain a strong security posture by ensuring that policies are in place, controls are implemented, gaps are identified for cybersecurity risks mitigation. However, audits are usually manual, requiring much time and costs. This paper looks at the possibility of developing a framework to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) as an autonomous agent to execute part of the security audit, namely with the field audit. password policy compliance for Windows operating system. Through the conduct of an exploration experiment of using GPT-4 with Langchain, the agent executed the audit tasks by accurately flagging password policy violations and appeared to be more efficient than traditional manual audits. Despite its potential limitations in operational consistency in complex and dynamic environment, the framework suggests possibilities to extend further to real-time threat monitoring and compliance checks.'}

However, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate exogenous texts and align them with the probabilistic nature of large language models (LLMs). Current approaches either employ shallow text-time series fusion via basic prompts or rely on deterministic numerical decoding that conflict with LLMs' token-generation paradigm, which limits contextual awareness and distribution modeling. To address these limitations, we propose CAPTime, a context-aware probabilistic multimodal time series forecasting method that leverages text-informed abstraction and autoregressive LLM decoding. Our method first encodes temporal patterns using a pretrained time series encoder, then aligns them with textual contexts via learnable interactions to produce joint multimodal representations. By combining a mixture of distribution experts with frozen LLMs, we enable context-aware probabilistic forecasting while preserving LLMs' inherent distribution modeling capabilities. Experiments on diverse time series forecasting tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization of CAPTime, particularly in multimodal scenarios. Additional analysis highlights its robustness in data-scarce scenarios through hybrid probabilistic decoding."}

Recent efforts in hardware-aware neural architecture search (NAS) automate architecture discovery for specific platforms; however, none focus on general time-series analysis with edge deployment. Leveraging the problem-solving and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLM), we propose MONAQ, a novel framework that reformulates NAS into Multi-Objective Neural Architecture Querying tasks. MONAQ is equipped with multimodal query generation for processing multimodal time-series inputs and hardware constraints, alongside an LLM agent-based multi-objective search to achieve deployment-ready models via code generation. By integrating numerical data, time-series images, and textual descriptions, MONAQ improves an LLM's understanding of time-series data. Experiments on fifteen datasets demonstrate that MONAQ-discovered models outperform both handcrafted models and NAS baselines while being more efficient."}

However, existing LLM-based exploration approaches rely heavily on LLMs to generate actions in almost every step, leading to a huge cost of token fees and computational resources. We argue that such extensive usage of LLMs is neither necessary nor effective, since many actions during exploration do not require, or may even be biased by the abilities of LLMs. Further, based on the insight that a precise and compact knowledge plays the central role for effective exploration, we introduce LLM-Explorer, a new exploration agent designed for efficiency and affordability. LLM-Explorer uses LLMs primarily for maintaining the knowledge instead of generating actions, and knowledge is used to guide action generation in a LLM-less manner. Based on a comparison with 5 strong baselines on 20 typical apps, LLM-Explorer was able to achieve the fastest and highest coverage among all automated app explorers, with over 148x lower cost than the state-of-the-art LLM-based approach.'}

Rodriguez, Ugur Kursuncu, Muhammed Y. Idris', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10472', 'abstract': "Effective communication about breast and cervical cancers remains a persistent health challenge, with significant gaps in public understanding of cancer prevention, screening, and treatment, potentially leading to delayed diagnoses and inadequate treatments. This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating accurate, safe, and accessible cancer-related information to support patient understanding. We evaluated five general-purpose and three medical LLMs using a mixed-methods evaluation framework across linguistic quality, safety and trustworthiness, and communication accessibility and affectiveness. Our approach utilized quantitative metrics, qualitative expert ratings, and statistical analysis using Welch's ANOVA, Games-Howell, and Hedges' g. Our results show that general-purpose LLMs produced outputs of higher linguistic quality and affectiveness, while medical LLMs demonstrate greater communication accessibility. However, medical LLMs tend to exhibit higher levels of potential harm, toxicity, and bias, reducing their performance in safety and trustworthiness. Our findings indicate a duality between domain-specific knowledge and safety in health communications. The results highlight the need for intentional model design with targeted improvements, particularly in mitigating harm and bias, and improving safety and affectiveness. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs for cancer communication, offering critical insights for improving AI-generated health content and informing future development of accurate, safe, and accessible digital health tools."}
