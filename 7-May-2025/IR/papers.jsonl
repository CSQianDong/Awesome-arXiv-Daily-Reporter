RSA dynamically modulates token-document interactions by considering the influence of other documents in the dataset, better contrasting document representations. Experiments show that incorporating RSA consistently improves multiple sparse retrieval models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets from the BEIR benchmark. this https URL'}

A newly discovered bias, known as sentiment bias, uncovers a common phenomenon within Review-based RSs (RRSs): the recommendation accuracy of users or items with negative reviews deteriorates compared with users or items with positive reviews. Critical users and niche items are disadvantaged by such unfair recommendations. We study this problem from the perspective of counterfactual inference with two stages. At the model training stage, we build a causal graph and model how sentiment influences the final rating score. During the inference stage, we decouple the direct and indirect effects to mitigate the impact of sentiment bias and remove the indirect effect using counterfactual inference. We have conducted extensive experiments, and the results validate that our model can achieve comparable performance on rating prediction for better recommendations and effective mitigation of sentiment bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ counterfactual inference on sentiment bias mitigation in RSs.'}

This natural tendency is reflected in data from streaming platforms as the amount of previously unknown content accessed by users. Additionally, in domains such as that of music streaming there is evidence that recommending novel content improves users' experience with the platform. Therefore, understanding users' discovery patterns, such as the amount to which and the way users access previously unknown content, is a topic of relevance for both the scientific community and the streaming industry, particularly the music one. Previous works studied how music consumption differs for users of different traits and looked at diversity, novelty, and consistency over time of users' music preferences. However, very little is known about how users discover and explore previously unknown music, and how this behavior differs for users of varying discovery needs. In this paper we bridge this gap by analyzing data from a survey answered by users of the major music streaming platform Deezer in combination with their streaming data. We first address questions regarding whether users who declare a higher interest in unfamiliar music listen to more diverse music, have more stable music preferences over time, and explore more music within a same time window, compared to those who declare a lower interest. We then investigate which type of music tracks users choose to listen to when they explore unfamiliar music, identifying clear patterns of popularity and genre representativeness that vary for users of different discovery needs.\nOur findings open up possibilities to infer users' interest in unfamiliar music from streaming data as well as possibilities to develop recommender systems that guide users in exploring music in a more natural way."}

We propose STAR-Rec, a novel architecture that synergistically combines preference-aware attention and state-space modeling through a sequence-level mixture-of-experts framework. STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing preference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item relationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to efficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3) incorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different behavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused category-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns. We theoretically demonstrate how the state space model and attention mechanisms can be naturally unified in recommendation scenarios, where SSM captures temporal dynamics through state compression while attention models both similar and diverse item relationships. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods, particularly in scenarios involving diverse user behaviors and varying sequence lengths.'}

We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that pathlet learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work improves our understanding of users' interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and fostering diversity in recommender systems.

Given a distributed data storage system, efficient PIR can be achieved by making assumptions about the colluding capabilities of the storage servers holding the database. If these assumptions turn out to be incorrect, privacy is lost. In this work, we focus on the worst-case assumption: full collusion or, equivalently, viewing the storage system virtually as a single honest-but-curious server. We present CB-cPIR, a single-server code-based computational private information retrieval (cPIR) scheme that derives security from code-based cryptography. Specifically, the queries are protected by the hardness of decoding a random linear code. The scheme is heavily inspired by the pioneering code-based cPIR scheme proposed by Holzbaur, Hollanti, and Wachter-Zeh in [Holzbaur et al., "Computational Code-Based Single-Server Private Information Retrieval", 2020 IEEE ISIT] and fixes the vulnerabilities of the original scheme arising from highly probable rank differences in submatrices of the user\'s query. For further validation, we draw comparisons to the state-of-the-art lattice-based cPIR schemes.'}

In this study, explanations were based solely on item features rather than personalized data, simulating recommendation scenarios. We compared user perceptions of one-sided (purely positive) and two-sided (positive and negative) feature-based explanations for popular movie recommendations. Through an online study with 129 participants, we examined how explanation style affected perceived trust, transparency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. One-sided explanations consistently received higher ratings across all dimensions. Our findings suggest that in low-stakes entertainment domains such as popular movie recommendations, simpler positive explanations may be more effective. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounding factors such as item familiarity and the placement of negative information in explanations. This work provides practical insights for explanation design in recommender interfaces and highlights the importance of context in shaping user preferences.'}

Both methods integrate seamlessly with existing LLMs to ensure in-domain recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on three recommendation datasets demonstrate that RecLM-cgen consistently outperforms RecLM-ret and existing LLM-based recommender models in accuracy while eliminating OOD recommendations, making it the preferred method for adoption.

However, in real-world applications, it is difficult to guarantee that computationally affordable paths exist toward all candidate entities. According to our observation, the prediction accuracy drops significantly when paths are absent. To make the proposed algorithm more stable against the missing path circumstances, we introduce soft reasoning paths. Concretely, a specific learnable latent path embedding is concatenated to each relation to help better model the characteristics of the corresponding paths. The combination of the relation and the corresponding learnable embedding is termed a soft path in our paper. By aligning the soft paths with the reasoning paths, a learnable embedding is guided to learn a generalized path representation of the corresponding relation. In addition, we introduce a hierarchical ranking strategy to make full use of information about the entity, relation, path, and soft path to help improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the model. Extensive experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the compared state-of-the-art algorithms by a notable margin.

Using eye-tracking data collected via a lab user study (N=18), we achieved a Macro F1 score of 71.25% for predicting topic familiarity with a Gradient Boosting classifier, and a Macro F1 score of 60.54% with a k-nearest neighbours (KNN) classifier for query specificity.

To optimize the RAG performance, most previous work independently fine-tunes the retriever to adapt to frozen LLM s or trains the LLMs to use documents retrieved by off-the-shelf retrievers, lacking end-to-end training supervision. Recent work addresses this limitation by jointly training these two components but relies on overly simplifying assumptions of document independence, which has been criticized for being far from real-world scenarios. Thus, effectively optimizing the overall RAG performance remains a critical challenge.\nWe propose a direct retrieval-augmented optimization framework, named DRO, that enables end-to-end training of two key components: (i) a generative knowledge selection model and (ii) an LLM generator. DRO alternates between two phases: (i) document permutation estimation and (ii) re-weighted maximization, progressively improving RAG components through a variational approach. In the estimation step, we treat document permutation as a latent variable and directly estimate its distribution from the selection model by applying an importance sampling strategy. In the maximization step, we calibrate the optimization expectation using importance weights and jointly train the selection model and LLM generator. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DRO is analogous to policy-gradient methods in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets illustrate that DRO outperforms the best baseline with 5%-15% improvements in EM and F1. We also provide in-depth experiments to qualitatively analyze the stability, convergence, and variance of DRO.'}

To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.'}
