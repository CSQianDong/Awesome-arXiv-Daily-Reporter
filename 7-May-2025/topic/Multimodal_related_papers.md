**Abstract**: Understanding and predicting human behavior has emerged as a core capability in various AI application domains such as autonomous driving, smart healthcare, surveillance systems, and social robotics. This paper defines the technical framework of Artificial Behavior Intelligence (ABI), which comprehensively analyzes and interprets human posture, facial expressions, emotions, behavioral sequences, and contextual cues. It details the essential components of ABI, including pose estimation, face and emotion recognition, sequential behavior analysis, and context-aware modeling. Furthermore, we highlight the transformative potential of recent advances in large-scale pretrained models, such as large language models (LLMs), vision foundation models, and multimodal integration models, in significantly improving the accuracy and interpretability of behavior recognition. Our research team has a strong interest in the ABI domain and is actively conducting research, particularly focusing on the development of intelligent lightweight models capable of efficiently inferring complex human behaviors. This paper identifies several technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy ABI in real-world applications including learning behavioral intelligence from limited data, quantifying uncertainty in complex behavior prediction, and optimizing model structures for low-power, real-time inference. To tackle these challenges, our team is exploring various optimization strategies including lightweight transformers, graph-based recognition architectures, energy-aware loss functions, and multimodal knowledge distillation, while validating their applicability in real-time environments.

# OSUniverse: Benchmark for Multimodal GUI-navigation AI Agents 

**Authors**: Mariya Davydova, Daniel Jeffries, Patrick Barker, Arturo Márquez Flores, Sinéad Ryan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03570)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce OSUniverse: a benchmark of complex, multimodal desktop-oriented tasks for advanced GUI-navigation AI agents that focuses on ease of use, extensibility, comprehensive coverage of test cases, and automated validation. We divide the tasks in increasing levels of complexity, from basic precision clicking to multistep, multiapplication tests requiring dexterity, precision, and clear thinking from the agent. In version one of the benchmark, presented here, we have calibrated the complexity of the benchmark test cases to ensure that the SOTA (State of the Art) agents (at the time of publication) do not achieve results higher than 50%, while the average white collar worker can perform all these tasks with perfect accuracy. The benchmark can be scored manually, but we also introduce an automated validation mechanism that has an average error rate less than 2%. Therefore, this benchmark presents solid ground for fully automated measuring of progress, capabilities and the effectiveness of GUI-navigation AI agents over the short and medium-term horizon. The source code of the benchmark is available at this https URL.

# Evaluating the Impact of AI-Powered Audiovisual Personalization on Learner Emotion, Focus, and Learning Outcomes 

**Authors**: George Xi Wang, Jingying Deng, Safinah Ali  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03033)  

**Abstract**: Independent learners often struggle with sustaining focus and emotional regulation in unstructured or distracting settings. Although some rely on ambient aids such as music, ASMR, or visual backgrounds to support concentration, these tools are rarely integrated into cohesive, learner-centered systems. Moreover, existing educational technologies focus primarily on content adaptation and feedback, overlooking the emotional and sensory context in which learning takes place. Large language models have demonstrated powerful multimodal capabilities including the ability to generate and adapt text, audio, and visual content. Educational research has yet to fully explore their potential in creating personalized audiovisual learning environments. To address this gap, we introduce an AI-powered system that uses LLMs to generate personalized multisensory study environments. Users select or generate customized visual themes (e.g., abstract vs. realistic, static vs. animated) and auditory elements (e.g., white noise, ambient ASMR, familiar vs. novel sounds) to create immersive settings aimed at reducing distraction and enhancing emotional stability. Our primary research question investigates how combinations of personalized audiovisual elements affect learner cognitive load and engagement. Using a mixed-methods design that incorporates biometric measures and performance outcomes, this study evaluates the effectiveness of LLM-driven sensory personalization. The findings aim to advance emotionally responsive educational technologies and extend the application of multimodal LLMs into the sensory dimension of self-directed learning.

# The Multimodal Paradox: How Added and Missing Modalities Shape Bias and Performance in Multimodal AI 

**Authors**: Kishore Sampath, Pratheesh, Ayaazuddin Mohammad, Resmi Ramachandranpillai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03020)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal learning, which integrates diverse data sources such as images, text, and structured data, has proven superior to unimodal counterparts in high-stakes decision-making. However, while performance gains remain the gold standard for evaluating multimodal systems, concerns around bias and robustness are frequently overlooked. In this context, this paper explores two key research questions (RQs): (i) RQ1 examines whether adding a modality con-sistently enhances performance and investigates its role in shaping fairness measures, assessing whether it mitigates or amplifies bias in multimodal models; (ii) RQ2 investigates the impact of missing modalities at inference time, analyzing how multimodal models generalize in terms of both performance and fairness. Our analysis reveals that incorporating new modalities during training consistently enhances the performance of multimodal models, while fairness trends exhibit variability across different evaluation measures and datasets. Additionally, the absence of modalities at inference degrades performance and fairness, raising concerns about its robustness in real-world deployment. We conduct extensive experiments using multimodal healthcare datasets containing images, time series, and structured information to validate our findings.

# ReGraP-LLaVA: Reasoning enabled Graph-based Personalized Large Language and Vision Assistant 

**Authors**: Yifan Xiang, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Yixuan Weng, Shoujun Zhou, Yangfan He, Keqin Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03654)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in personalized MLLMs enable effective capture of user-specific concepts, supporting both recognition of personalized concepts and contextual captioning. However, humans typically explore and reason over relations among objects and individuals, transcending surface-level information to achieve more personalized and contextual understanding. To this end, existing methods may face three main limitations: Their training data lacks multi-object sets in which relations among objects are learnable. Building on the limited training data, their models overlook the relations between different personalized concepts and fail to reason over them. Their experiments mainly focus on a single personalized concept, where evaluations are limited to recognition and captioning tasks. To address the limitations, we present a new dataset named ReGraP, consisting of 120 sets of personalized knowledge. Each set includes images, KGs, and CoT QA pairs derived from the KGs, enabling more structured and sophisticated reasoning pathways. We propose ReGraP-LLaVA, an MLLM trained with the corresponding KGs and CoT QA pairs, where soft and hard graph prompting methods are designed to align KGs within the model's semantic space. We establish the ReGraP Benchmark, which contains diverse task types: multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, True/False, and descriptive questions in both open- and closed-ended settings. The proposed benchmark is designed to evaluate the relational reasoning and knowledge-connection capability of personalized MLLMs. We conduct experiments on the proposed ReGraP-LLaVA and other competitive MLLMs. Results show that the proposed model not only learns personalized knowledge but also performs relational reasoning in responses, achieving the SoTA performance compared with the competitive methods. All the codes and datasets are released at: this https URL.

# Reinforced Correlation Between Vision and Language for Precise Medical AI Assistant 

**Authors**: Haonan Wang, Jiaji Mao, Lehan Wang, Qixiang Zhang, Marawan Elbatel, Yi Qin, Huijun Hu, Baoxun Li, Wenhui Deng, Weifeng Qin, Hongrui Li, Jialin Liang, Jun Shen, Xiaomeng Li

**Abstract**: Medical AI assistants support doctors in disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, and report generation. However, they still face significant challenges in clinical use, including limited accuracy with multimodal content and insufficient validation in real-world settings. We propose RCMed, a full-stack AI assistant that improves multimodal alignment in both input and output, enabling precise anatomical delineation, accurate localization, and reliable diagnosis through hierarchical vision-language grounding. A self-reinforcing correlation mechanism allows visual features to inform language context, while language semantics guide pixel-wise attention, forming a closed loop that refines both modalities. This correlation is enhanced by a color region description strategy, translating anatomical structures into semantically rich text to learn shape-location-text relationships across scales. Trained on 20 million image-mask-description triplets, RCMed achieves state-of-the-art precision in contextualizing irregular lesions and subtle anatomical boundaries, excelling in 165 clinical tasks across 9 modalities. It achieved a 23.5% relative improvement in cell segmentation from microscopy images over prior methods. RCMed's strong vision-language alignment enables exceptional generalization, with state-of-the-art performance in external validation across 20 clinically significant cancer types, including novel tasks. This work demonstrates how integrated multimodal models capture fine-grained patterns, enabling human-level interpretation in complex scenarios and advancing human-centric AI healthcare.

# SD-VSum: A Method and Dataset for Script-Driven Video Summarization 

**Authors**: Manolis Mylonas, Evlampios Apostolidis, Vasileios Mezaris  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03319)  

**Abstract**: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that relies on the use of a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against state-of-the-art approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.

# Seeing the Abstract: Translating the Abstract Language for Vision Language Models 

**Authors**: Davide Talon, Federico Girella, Ziyue Liu, Marco Cristani, Yiming Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03242)  

**Abstract**: Natural language goes beyond dryly describing visual content. It contains rich abstract concepts to express feeling, creativity and properties that cannot be directly perceived. Yet, current research in Vision Language Models (VLMs) has not shed light on abstract-oriented language. Our research breaks new ground by uncovering its wide presence and under-estimated value, with extensive analysis. Particularly, we focus our investigation on the fashion domain, a highly-representative field with abstract expressions. By analyzing recent large-scale multimodal fashion datasets, we find that abstract terms have a dominant presence, rivaling the concrete ones, providing novel information, and being useful in the retrieval task. However, a critical challenge emerges: current general-purpose or fashion-specific VLMs are pre-trained with databases that lack sufficient abstract words in their text corpora, thus hindering their ability to effectively represent abstract-oriented language. We propose a training-free and model-agnostic method, Abstract-to-Concrete Translator (ACT), to shift abstract representations towards well-represented concrete ones in the VLM latent space, using pre-trained models and existing multimodal databases. On the text-to-image retrieval task, despite being training-free, ACT outperforms the fine-tuned VLMs in both same- and cross-dataset settings, exhibiting its effectiveness with a strong generalization capability. Moreover, the improvement introduced by ACT is consistent with various VLMs, making it a plug-and-play solution.
