However, it also presents potential challenges in handling feature interactions. Firstly, Transformers may encounter information loss when capturing feature interactions. By relying on inner products to represent pairwise relationships, they compress raw interaction information, which can result in a degradation of fidelity. Secondly, due to the long-tail features distribution, feature fields with low information-abundance embeddings constrain the information abundance of other fields, leading to collapsed embedding matrices. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Attention Framework for Enhanced Feature Interaction, known as Dual Enhanced Attention. This framework integrates two attention mechanisms: the Combo-ID attention mechanism and the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism. The Combo-ID attention mechanism directly retains feature interaction pairs to mitigate information loss, while the collapse-avoiding attention mechanism adaptively filters out low information-abundance interaction pairs to prevent interaction collapse. Extensive experiments conducted on industrial datasets have shown the effectiveness of Dual Enhanced Attention.'}

However, the training data available typically comprises implicit feedback, manifested as user clicks and purchase behaviors, rather than explicit declarations of user preferences. This type of training data presents three main challenges for accurate ranking prediction: First, the unobservable nature of user preferences makes likelihood function modeling inherently difficult. Second, the resulting false positives (FP) and false negatives (FN) introduce noise into the learning process, disrupting parameter learning. Third, data bias arises as observed interactions tend to concentrate on a few popular items, exacerbating the feedback loop of popularity bias. To address these issues, we propose Variational BPR, a novel and easily implementable learning objective that integrates key components for enhancing collaborative filtering: likelihood optimization, noise reduction, and popularity debiasing. Our approach involves decomposing the pairwise loss under the ELBO-KL framework and deriving its variational lower bound to establish a manageable learning objective for approximate inference. Within this bound, we introduce an attention-based latent interest prototype contrastive mechanism, replacing instance-level contrastive learning, to effectively reduce noise from problematic samples. The process of deriving interest prototypes implicitly incorporates a flexible hard sample mining strategy, capable of simultaneously identifying hard positive and hard negative samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this hard sample mining strategy promotes feature distribution uniformity, thereby alleviating popularity bias. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Variational BPR on popular backbone recommendation models. The code and data are available at: this https URL'}

Taylor', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10886', 'abstract': 'In the context of pressing climate change challenges and the significant biodiversity loss among arthropods, automated taxonomic classification from organismal images is a subject of intense research. However, traditional AI pipelines based on deep neural visual architectures such as CNNs or ViTs face limitations such as degraded performance on the long-tail of classes and the inability to reason about their predictions. We integrate image captioning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) to enhance biodiversity monitoring, showing particular promise for characterizing rare and unknown arthropod species. While a naive Vision-Language Model (VLM) excels in classifying images of common species, the RAG model enables classification of rarer taxa by matching explicit textual descriptions of taxonomic features to contextual biodiversity text data from external sources. The RAG model shows promise in reducing overconfidence and enhancing accuracy relative to naive LLMs, suggesting its viability in capturing the nuances of taxonomic hierarchy, particularly at the challenging family and genus levels. Our findings highlight the potential for modern vision-language AI pipelines to support biodiversity conservation initiatives, emphasizing the role of comprehensive data curation and collaboration with citizen science platforms to improve species identification, unknown species characterization and ultimately inform conservation strategies.'}

To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage training framework for large language models (LLMs). In the first stage, a contrastive learning approach is used to train the model on a dataset constructed from real-world matching rules, such as geographical alignment and research area overlap. While effective, this model primarily learns patterns that defined by the matching rules. In the second stage, we introduce a novel preference-based fine-tuning method inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), termed Rank Preference Optimization (RankPO), to align the model with AI-curated pairwise preferences emphasizing textual understanding. Our experiments show that while the first-stage model achieves strong performance on rule-based data (nDCG@20 = 0.706), it lacks robust textual understanding (alignment with AI annotations = 0.46). By fine-tuning with RankPO, we achieve a balanced model that retains relatively good performance in the original tasks while significantly improving the alignment with AI preferences.

The incorporation of advanced language understanding techniques has substantially improved the dialogue fluency of such systems. However, while modern language models demonstrate strong proficiency in interpreting user preferences articulated through natural conversation, they frequently encounter challenges in effectively utilizing collective behavioral patterns - a crucial element for generating relevant suggestions. To mitigate this limitation, this work presents a novel probabilistic framework that synergizes behavioral patterns with conversational interactions through latent preference modeling. The proposed method establishes a dual-channel alignment mechanism where implicit preference representations learned from collective user interactions serve as a connecting mechanism between behavioral data and linguistic expressions. Specifically, the framework first derives latent preference representations through established collaborative filtering techniques, then employs these representations to jointly refine both the linguistic preference expressions and behavioral patterns through an adaptive fusion process. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach compared to various state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in aligning conversational interactions with collaborative behavioral signals.'}

This paper introduces ClaimTrust, a propagation-based trust scoring framework that dynamically evaluates the reliability of documents in a RAG system. Using a modified PageRank-inspired algorithm, ClaimTrust propagates trust scores across documents based on relationships derived from extracted factual claims. We preprocess and analyze 814 political news articles from Kaggle's Fake News Detection Dataset to extract 2,173 unique claims and classify 965 meaningful relationships (supporting or contradicting). By representing the dataset as a document graph, ClaimTrust iteratively updates trust scores until convergence, effectively differentiating trustworthy articles from unreliable ones. Our methodology, which leverages embedding-based filtering for efficient claim comparison and relationship classification, achieves a 11.2% of significant connections while maintaining computational scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that ClaimTrust successfully assigns higher trust scores to verified documents while penalizing those containing false information. Future directions include fine-tuned claim extract and compare (Li et al., 2022), parameter optimization, enhanced language model utilization, and robust evaluation metrics to generalize the framework across diverse datasets and domains."}

We introduce the ordered diverse sampling problem based on a new metric that measures the diversity in an ordered list of samples. We present a novel approach for generating ordered diverse samples for textual data that uses principal components on the embedding vectors. The proposed approach is simple and compared with existing approaches using the new metric. We transform standard text classification benchmarks into benchmarks for ordered diverse sampling. Our empirical evaluation shows that prevailing approaches perform 6% to 61% worse than our method while also being more time inefficient. Ablation studies show how the parts of the new approach contribute to the overall metrics.'}

Although these speech act indicators communicate the user\\textquotesingle s intent -- whether it is asking a question, making a request, or stating a fact -- they do not necessarily add to the core informational content of the query itself. This paper investigates whether extracting the underlying propositional content from user utterances -- essentially stripping away the linguistic markers of intent -- can improve retrieval quality in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Drawing upon foundational insights from speech act theory, we propose a practical method for automatically transforming queries into their propositional equivalents before embedding. To assess the efficacy of this approach, we conducted an experimental study involving 63 user queries related to a Brazilian telecommunications news corpus with precomputed semantic embeddings. Results demonstrate clear improvements in semantic similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings at top ranks, confirming that queries stripped of speech act indicators more effectively retrieve relevant content.'}
