We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless, maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a common challenge across all models.'}

However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge. Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size.

Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.'}

This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning.

To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in complex, cross-domain scientific research.

AlgoSimBench consists of 1317 problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but algorithmically dissimilar distractors.

To address this challenge, we propose attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy.

We address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning, and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language, highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor interpretation tasks.

Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$ different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks that better reflect LLMs\' genuine reasoning capabilities.'}

Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning, Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines.

We introduce the task of intent-based chart generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their corresponding charts.

Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.'}

Most available datasets are in English, but even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP) while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model reliability.'}

Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which can be generalized to other tasks.

Although many open-source projects aim to close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development, we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K, MiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations.

Our findings show that LLMs over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative understanding.

A common workaround is to translate existing English alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured formats like JSON.

We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.

Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law, politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race, gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps, and create different political factual realities for people of different identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are conducted before future deployment."}

This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability."}

Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods might be made more robust.'}

While most current research emphasizes inductive coding applications, we address the underexplored potential of LLMs to perform deductive classification tasks aligned with established human-coded schemes. Using the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries into 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot, few-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's alpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and Cramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention strategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V values ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in classification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved the strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746), achieving thresholds for substantial agreement. Despite the semantic ambiguity within case summaries, ChatGPT displayed stable agreement across samples, including high F1 scores in low-support subclasses. These findings demonstrate that with targeted, custom-tailored interventions, LLMs can achieve reliability levels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows."}

However, such summaries must not only be accurate and concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity, while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of LLMs for democratic applications.'}

Although this sparsity presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently, we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for efficient inference in large-scale language models.'}

One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge."}

With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning.

To address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH.

Our initial evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%.

Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score.

In this paper, we present JAM (Just Ask for Music), a lightweight and intuitive framework for natural language music recommendation. JAM models user-query-item interactions as vector translations in a shared latent space, inspired by knowledge graph embedding methods like TransE.

This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

Recent research uses large language models (LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent, the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements. Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies.

We adapt cognitive science methodologies from human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems. Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight; LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing. Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems."}

Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and models are available at this https URL.'}

In this work, we propose a new ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM) via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of axioms.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency.

We investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or additional guidance.

However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model\'s higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model\'s latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.'}

This allows the model to develop proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages: (1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps for substantial improvements.

One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM\'s context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place.\nWe propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy.

Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional rule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs) further exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing phishing emails at minimal cost.\nThis work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive phishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all commercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose PiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages knowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails often contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts. PiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an email, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the legitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and (iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory claims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable explanations.\nCompared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector, PiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks like Nazario and PhishPot.

Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages.

This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model.

As LLM agents are increasingly deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.\nRecent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus, forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives a quorum of votes.\nTo address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques.\nExperimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers."}

To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks."}

However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.'}

To address this gap, we conducted a study with 17 participants using an LLM-based technical interview practice tool. Participants valued AI's role in simulation, feedback, and learning from generated examples. Key design recommendations include promoting social presence in conversational AI for technical interview simulation, providing feedback beyond verbal content analysis, and enabling crowdsourced think-aloud examples through human-AI collaboration. Beyond feature design, we examined broader considerations, including intersectional challenges and potential strategies to address them, how AI-driven interview preparation could promote equitable learning in computing careers, and the need to rethink AI's role in interview practice by suggesting a research direction that integrates human-AI collaboration."}

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let\'s try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

According to the widely adopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and are often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically generating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can significantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software lifecycle.\nThis paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies on the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language models (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including docstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to the full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the chain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models -- achieves the best results, with up to 96.3\\% branch coverage, a 57\\% average mutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate. Among the evaluated models, M5 (Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrated superior performance in both mutation score and branch coverage being still in top in terms of compilation success rate.\nAll the code and resulting test suites are publicly available at this https URL."}

However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.\nOur focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely used Java libraries, e.g., this http URL and this http URL packages. Our key insight is that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large language models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.'}

Writing specifications correctly, however, remains particularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using large language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known language Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write complete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English). Two, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with respect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of Alloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy expressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent the desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the experimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show that the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas from input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to enumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at completing given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language descriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases). We believe LLMs offer a very exciting advance in our ability to write specifications, and can help make specifications take a pivotal role in software development and enhance our ability to build robust software.'}
