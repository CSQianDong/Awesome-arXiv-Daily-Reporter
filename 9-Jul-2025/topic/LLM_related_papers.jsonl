In particular, RecRanker samples users via clustering, generates an initial ranking list using an initial recommendation model, and fine-tunes an LLM through hybrid instruction tuning to infer user preferences. However, the contribution of each core component remains underexplored. In this work, we inspect the reproducibility of RecRanker, and study the impact and role of its various components. We begin by reproducing the RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components. Our reproduction shows that the pairwise and listwise methods achieve a performance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the pointwise method, while we are also able to reproduce the original paper's results, further analysis shows that the performance is abnormally high due to data leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts. To enable a fair and comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based top-k recommendations, we propose RecRankerEval, an extensible framework that covers five key dimensions: user sampling strategy, initial recommendation model, LLM backbone, dataset selection, and instruction tuning method. Using the RecRankerEval framework, we show that the original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on the ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset, but not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the original RecRanker paper. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RecRanker's performance can be improved by employing alternative user sampling methods, stronger initial recommenders, and more capable LLMs."}

Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of users and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss due to dimensionality reduction, sparse interactions, and so on. With the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, some methods use embeddings as LLM inputs for explanation generation. However, since embeddings lack inherent semantics, LLMs must adjust or extend their parameters to interpret them, a process that inevitably incurs information loss. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach combining profile generation via hierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS), which leverages a pretrained LLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured textual profiles as explicit representations of user and item characteristics. Additionally, we propose contrastive prompting for explanation generation (CPEG) which employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language models in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations. Finally, we use the textual profiles of user and item as input and high-quality explanation as output to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a great improvement on metrics about explainability (e.g., 5% on GPTScore) and text quality. Furthermore, our generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly higher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPEG in generating high-quality ground truths.'}

Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their powerful generalization and language understanding capabilities.

To address this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that integrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to align their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are designed to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements over strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work advances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and effective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the semantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub: this https URL'}

Existing LLM-based recommendation approaches typically formulate the recommendation task using specialised prompts designed to leverage their contextual abilities, and aligning their outputs closely with human preferences to yield an improved recommendation performance. However, the use of LLMs for recommendation tasks is limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge. This lack of relevant relational knowledge about the items to be recommended in the LLM's pre-training corpus can lead to inaccuracies or hallucinations, resulting in incorrect or misleading recommendations. Moreover, directly using information from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy information, which can affect the LLM's reasoning process or exceed its input context length, thereby reducing the performance of LLM-based recommendations. To address the lack of domain-specific knowledge, we propose a novel model called Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation (KERAG_R). Specifically, we leverage a graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) component to integrate additional information from a knowledge graph (KG) into instructions, enabling the LLM to collaboratively exploit recommendation signals from both text-based user interactions and the knowledge graph to better estimate the users' preferences in a recommendation context. In particular, we perform graph RAG by pre-training a graph attention network (GAT) to select the most relevant triple for the target users for the used LLM, thereby enhancing the LLM while reducing redundant and noisy information. Our extensive experiments on three public datasets show that our proposed KERAG_R model significantly outperforms ten existing state-of-the-art recommendation methods."}

Data consumers often spend 25-98 % of their time searching for suitable data due to the exponential growth, heterogeneity and distribution of data. Data catalogs can support and accelerate data exploration by using metadata to answer user queries. However, as metadata creation and maintenance is often a manual process, it is time-consuming and requires expertise. This study investigates whether LLMs can automate metadata maintenance of text-based data and generate high-quality DCAT-compatible metadata. We tested zero-shot and few-shot prompting strategies with LLMs from different vendors for generating metadata such as titles and keywords, along with a fine-tuned model for classification. Our results show that LLMs can generate metadata comparable to human-created content, particularly on tasks that require advanced semantic understanding. Larger models outperformed smaller ones, and fine-tuning significantly improves classification accuracy, while few-shot prompting yields better results in most cases. Although LLMs offer a faster and reliable way to create metadata, a successful application requires careful consideration of task-specific criteria and domain context.'}

This paper introduces a proactive defense paradigm, shifting from passive post hoc detection to anticipatory mitigation strategies. We propose a Three Pillars framework: (1) Knowledge Credibility, fortifying the integrity of training and deployed data; (2) Inference Reliability, embedding self-corrective mechanisms during reasoning; and (3) Input Robustness, enhancing the resilience of model interfaces against adversarial attacks. Through a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and a comparative meta-analysis, we demonstrate that proactive defense strategies offer up to 63\\% improvement over conventional methods in misinformation prevention, despite non-trivial computational overhead and generalization challenges.

Understanding information propagation dynamics and developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods, including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes, emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social intelligence and realism of LLM agents."}

To systematically examine the predictive capabilities and affective biases of LLMs in ROP risk stratification, we propose Affective-ROPTester, an automated evaluation framework incorporating three prompting strategies: Instruction-based, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and In-Context Learning (ICL). The Instruction scheme assesses LLMs' intrinsic knowledge and associated biases, whereas the CoT and ICL schemes leverage external medical knowledge to enhance predictive accuracy. Crucially, we integrate emotional elements at the prompt level to investigate how different affective framings influence the model's ability to predict ROP and its bias patterns. Empirical results derived from the CROP dataset yield two principal observations. First, LLMs demonstrate limited efficacy in ROP risk prediction when operating solely on intrinsic knowledge, yet exhibit marked performance gains when augmented with structured external inputs. Second, affective biases are evident in the model outputs, with a consistent inclination toward overestimating medium- and high-risk cases. Third, compared to negative emotions, positive emotional framing contributes to mitigating predictive bias in model outputs.

We introduce OpenAgentSafety, a comprehensive and modular framework for evaluating agent behavior across eight critical risk categories. Unlike prior work, our framework evaluates agents that interact with real tools, including web browsers, code execution environments, file systems, bash shells, and messaging platforms; and supports over 350 multi-turn, multi-user tasks spanning both benign and adversarial user intents. OpenAgentSafety is designed for extensibility, allowing researchers to add tools, tasks, websites, and adversarial strategies with minimal effort. It combines rule-based analysis with LLM-as-judge assessments to detect both overt and subtle unsafe behaviors. Empirical analysis of five prominent LLMs in agentic scenarios reveals unsafe behavior in 51.2% of safety-vulnerable tasks with Claude-Sonnet-3.7, to 72.7% with o3-mini, highlighting critical safety vulnerabilities and the need for stronger safeguards before real-world deployment.'}

This commentary analyzes this practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique of prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of hidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed evaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as "honeypots" to detect reviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently self-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate. Publishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer review entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure requirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond peer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including plagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized policies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.'}

A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection. To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation, metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like behavior.

Constella suggests related characters (FRIENDS DISCOVERY feature), reveals the inner mindscapes of several characters simultaneously (JOURNALS feature), and manifests relationships through inter-character responses (COMMENTS feature).

Recently, metamorphic testing that defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate the robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing still requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization of selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically generating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally, most studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in their evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based approach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and minimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the combinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in the robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented four search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel encoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We conducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a random search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our statistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the MOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM robustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM robustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs across different Text-to-Text tasks.

One of the most effective approaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models. However, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a single generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have been introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision iterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a resource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage high-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation capabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a degradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these challenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed to enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of the generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user instructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation, and applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by selective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving improvements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning, enabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative refinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves instruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data generated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of data while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the non-revised initial responses.

To study these factors in isolation, we introduce a controlled setting based on shortest-path tasks in layered graphs. We train decoder-only transformers on question-trace-answer triples using a custom tokenizer, comparing models trained on optimal bottom-up dynamic programming traces with those trained on longer, valid traces involving backtracking. Surprisingly, with the same training-token budget, models trained on inefficient traces generalize better to unseen graphs. This benefit is not due to length alone-injecting arbitrary redundancy into reasoning traces fails to help and can even hurt performance. Instead, we find that generalization correlates with the model's confidence in next-token prediction, suggesting that long, coherent, and locally incremental traces make the training signal easier to optimize."}

To address these challenges, we propose LCDS, a Logic-Controlled Discharge Summary generation system. LCDS constructs a source mapping table by calculating textual similarity between EMRs and discharge summaries to constrain the scope of summarized content. Moreover, LCDS incorporates a comprehensive set of logical rules, enabling it to generate more reliable silver discharge summaries tailored to different clinical fields.

To better understand how LLMs can assist retargeting and its potential limitations, we characterize and evaluate the performance of LLM assistance across multiple datasets and charts of varying complexity, categorizing failures according to type and severity. In our evaluation, we compare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully generate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more constrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code construction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual encodings) based on properties of the example code and data.

However, in tasks such as text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective domain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of input pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the architectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by reinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder generates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output space. During training, the encoder produces representations and their similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the teacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach. The MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and adaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative samples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing the LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and healthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its effectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.'}

Our analysis uncovers a phenomenon we call lost-in-the-later, where LLMs tend to overlook or deprioritize information that appears later in a given context, revealing a strong positional bias that affects contextual grounding. We further find that reasoning models, as well as non-reasoning models prompted with chain-of-thought (CoT), use context even less than non-reasoning models without CoT and fail to mitigate the lost-in-the-later effect. CoT prompting, in particular, results in lower recall and shorter responses, leading to degraded contextual grounding.

We introduce a novel approach to address this discrepancy by synthesizing conversational data from existing text corpora. We present a pipeline that transforms a cluster of multiple related documents into an extended multi-turn, multi-topic information-seeking dialogue. Applying our pipeline to Wikipedia articles, we curate DocTalk, a multi-turn pre-training dialogue corpus consisting of over 730k long conversations. We hypothesize that exposure to such synthesized conversational structures during pre-training can enhance the fundamental multi-turn capabilities of LLMs, such as context memory and understanding. Empirically, we show that incorporating DocTalk during pre-training results in up to 40% gain in context memory and understanding, without compromising base performance.

Wang, Jian Du', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05261', 'abstract': 'Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in in-context learning, but verifying the correctness of their generated responses remains a challenge. Prior work has explored attribution at the sentence level, but these methods fall short when users seek attribution for specific keywords within the response, such as numbers, years, or names. To address this limitation, we propose TokenShapley, a novel token-level attribution method that combines Shapley value-based data attribution with KNN-based retrieval techniques inspired by recent advances in KNN-augmented LLMs. By leveraging a precomputed datastore for contextual retrieval and computing Shapley values to quantify token importance, TokenShapley provides a fine-grained data attribution approach. Extensive evaluations on four benchmarks show that TokenShapley outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in token-level attribution, achieving an 11-23% improvement in accuracy.'}

In this paper, we present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$ Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large language models.'}

Existing repository-level benchmarks primarily focus on single scenarios, such as code generation or bug fixing, without adequately capturing the diversity and complexity of real-world software or project engineering workflows. Furthermore, these benchmarks suffer from limited controllability in question positioning and reliability issues in their generated test cases. To address these limitations, we present CorePipe, a fully automated pipeline that converts repositories into comprehensive test cases, and introduce CoreCodeBench, a configurable multi-scenario repository-level benchmark. To simulate real engineering scenarios, CorePipe generates three types of atomic questions (Development, BugFix, and Test-Driven Development) specifically targeting core code segments. These atomic questions are further combined into three types of composite questions, with difficulty levels flexibly adjusted through hyperparameter tuning. CoreCodeBench provides a comprehensive and extensive repository-level benchmark to investigate the applicability of LLMs in real-world engineering projects. Experiments with 16 LLMs across diverse scenarios reveal varying capabilities and offer multi-dimensional insights into LLM performance in engineering contexts. The code for CorePipe is available at this https URL, and the data for CoreCodeBench can be accessed at this https URL.'}

Meta PARTNR provides simplified environments and robotic interactions within randomized indoor kitchen scenes. Each randomized kitchen scene is given a task where two robotic agents cooperatively work together to solve the task. We evaluated multiple frontier models on Meta PARTNER environments. Our results indicate that reasoning models like OpenAI o3-mini outperform non-reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-4o and Llama 3 when operating in PARTNR's robotic embodied environments. o3-mini displayed outperform across centralized, decentralized, full observability, and partial observability configurations. This provides a promising avenue of research for embodied robotic development."}
