Existing MSMTR models typically consist of four information units: scenario-shared, scenario-specific, task-shared, and task-specific networks. These units interact to generate four types of relationship information flows, directed from scenario-shared or scenario-specific networks to task-shared or task-specific networks. However, these models face two main limitations: 1) They often rely on complex architectures, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE) networks, which increase the complexity of information fusion, model size, and training cost. 2) They extract all available information flows without filtering out irrelevant or even harmful content, introducing potential noise. Regarding these challenges, we propose a lightweight Automated Information Flow Selection (AutoIFS) framework for MSMTR. To tackle the first issue, AutoIFS incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decouple the four information units, enabling more flexible and efficient information fusion with minimal parameter overhead. To address the second issue, AutoIFS introduces an information flow selection network that automatically filters out invalid scenario-task information flows based on model performance feedback. It employs a simple yet effective pruning function to eliminate useless information flows, thereby enhancing the impact of key relationships and improving model performance. Finally, we evaluate AutoIFS and confirm its effectiveness through extensive experiments on two public benchmark datasets and an online A/B test.'}

Although there exist many methods employing efficient attention and SSM-based models, these approaches struggle to effectively model long sequences and may exhibit unstable performance on short sequences. To address these challenges, we design a sparse attention mechanism, BlossomRec, which models both long-term and short-term user interests through attention computation to achieve stable performance across sequences of varying lengths. Specifically, we categorize user interests in recommendation systems into long-term and short-term interests, and compute them using two distinct sparse attention patterns, with the results combined through a learnable gated output. Theoretically, it significantly reduces the number of interactions participating in attention computation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BlossomRec, when integrated with state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, achieves comparable or even superior performance while significantly reducing memory usage, providing strong evidence of BlossomRec's efficiency and this http URL code is available at this https URL."}

Estimating User Domain Knowledge in Conversational Recommenders', 'authors': 'Ivica Kostric, Ujwal Gadiraju, Krisztian Balog', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13173', 'abstract': "The ideal conversational recommender system (CRS) acts like a savvy salesperson, adapting its language and suggestions to each user's level of expertise. However, most current systems treat all users as experts, leading to frustrating and inefficient interactions when users are unfamiliar with a domain. Systems that can adapt their conversational strategies to a user's knowledge level stand to offer a much more natural and effective experience. To make a step toward such adaptive systems, we introduce a new task: estimating user domain knowledge from conversations, enabling a CRS to better understand user needs and personalize interactions. A key obstacle to developing such adaptive systems is the lack of suitable data; to our knowledge, no existing dataset captures the conversational behaviors of users with varying levels of domain knowledge. Furthermore, in most dialogue collection protocols, users are free to express their own preferences, which tends to concentrate on popular items and well-known features, offering little insight into how novices explore or learn about unfamiliar features. To address this, we design a game-based data collection protocol that elicits varied expressions of knowledge, release the resulting dataset, and provide an initial analysis to highlight its potential for future work on user-knowledge-aware CRS."}

Its core relies on a coarse-to-fine hierarchical architecture that enables rapid candidate selection and precise semantic matching, achieving millisecond-level response over billion-scale corpora. This capability makes it essential not only in traditional search and recommendation scenarios but also in the emerging paradigm of generative recommendation driven by large language models, where semantic IDs-themselves a form of coarse-to-fine representation-play a foundational role. However, the widely adopted dual-tower encoding architecture introduces inherent challenges, primarily representational space misalignment and retrieval index inconsistency, which degrade matching accuracy, retrieval stability, and performance on long-tail queries. These issues are further magnified in semantic ID generation, ultimately limiting the performance ceiling of downstream generative models.\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes a simple and effective framework named SCI comprising two synergistic modules: a symmetric representation alignment module that employs an innovative input-swapping mechanism to unify the dual-tower representation space without adding parameters, and an consistent indexing with dual-tower synergy module that redesigns retrieval paths using a dual-view indexing strategy to maintain consistency from training to inference. The framework is systematic, lightweight, and engineering-friendly, requiring minimal overhead while fully supporting billion-scale deployment.

However, real-world applications often face situations where no training data is available, such as when launching new services or handling entirely new users. In such cases, conventional approaches cannot be applied. This study focuses on training-free recommendation, where no task-specific training is performed, and particularly on \\textit{training-free cold-start recommendation} (TFCSR), the more challenging case where the target user has no interactions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been explored as a promising solution, and numerous studies have been proposed. As the ability of text embedding models (TEMs) increases, they are increasingly recognized as applicable to training-free recommendation, but no prior work has directly compared LLMs and TEMs under identical conditions. We present the first controlled experiments that systematically evaluate these two approaches in the same setting. The results show that TEMs outperform LLM rerankers, and this trend holds not only in cold-start settings but also in warm-start settings with rich interactions. These findings indicate that direct LLM ranking is not the only viable option, contrary to the commonly shared belief, and TEM-based approaches provide a stronger and more scalable basis for training-free recommendation."}

This disconnect can mislead both academic research and industrial practice.\nWe present Iceberg, a holistic benchmark suite for end-to-end evaluation of VSS methods in realistic application contexts. From a task-centric view, Iceberg uncovers the Information Loss Funnel, which identifies three principal sources of end-to-end performance degradation: (1) Embedding Loss during feature extraction; (2) Metric Misuse, where distances poorly reflect task relevance; (3) Data Distribution Sensitivity, highlighting index robustness across skews and modalities. For a more comprehensive assessment, Iceberg spans eight diverse datasets across key domains such as image classification, face recognition, text retrieval, and recommendation systems. Each dataset, ranging from 1M to 100M vectors, includes rich, task-specific labels and evaluation metrics, enabling assessment of retrieval algorithms within the full application pipeline rather than in isolation. Iceberg benchmarks 13 state-of-the-art VSS methods and re-ranks them based on application-level metrics, revealing substantial deviations from traditional rankings derived purely from recall-latency evaluations.

Traditionally, user reviews have served as a critical source of rich, contextual information for enhancing recommendation quality. However, as LLMs demonstrate an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human-like text, this raises the question of whether explicit user reviews remain essential in the era of LLMs. In this paper, we provide a systematic investigation of the evolving role of text reviews in recommendation by comparing deep learning methods and LLM approaches. Particularly, we conduct extensive experiments on eight public datasets with LLMs and evaluate their performance in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning scenarios. We further introduce a benchmarking evaluation framework for review-aware recommender systems, RAREval, to comprehensively assess the contribution of textual reviews to the recommendation performance of review-aware recommender systems. Our framework examines various scenarios, including the removal of some or all textual reviews, random distortion, as well as recommendation performance in data sparsity and cold-start user settings. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of functioning as effective review-aware recommendation engines, generally outperforming traditional deep learning approaches, particularly in scenarios characterized by data sparsity and cold-start conditions. In addition, the removal of some or all textual reviews and random distortion does not necessarily lead to declines in recommendation accuracy.

Specifically, to handle behavior heterogeneity, we introduce a dual item-behavior fusion architecture that incorporates behavior information at both the input and intermediate levels, enabling preference modeling from multiple perspectives. To mitigate data sparsity, we design three behavior-level data augmentation methods that operate directly on behavior sequences rather than core item sequences. These methods generate diverse augmented views while preserving the semantic consistency of item sequences.

Building on foundational results, we extend stability theory to three key retrieval settings widely used in practice: (i) multi-vector search, where we prove that the popular Chamfer distance metric preserves single-vector stability, while average pooling aggregation may destroy it; (ii) filtered vector search, where we show that sufficiently large penalties for mismatched filters can induce stability even when the underlying search is unstable; and (iii) sparse vector search, where we formalize and prove novel sufficient stability conditions.

A common solution is to use multi-task learning (MTL) to train a unified model on post-click data to estimate the conversion rate (CVR) for these diverse targets. In practice, CVR prediction often encounters missing conversion data as many advertisers submit only a subset of user conversion actions due to privacy or other constraints, making the labels of multi-task data incomplete. If the model is trained on all available samples where advertisers submit user conversion actions, it may struggle when deployed to serve a subset of advertisers targeting specific conversion actions, as the training and deployment data distributions are mismatched. While considerable MTL efforts have been made, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively train a unified model with the incomplete and skewed multi-label data. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained Knowledge transfer framework for Asymmetric Multi-Label data (KAML). We introduce an attribution-driven masking strategy (ADM) to better utilize data with asymmetric multi-label data in training. However, the more relaxed masking in ADM is a double-edged sword: it provides additional training signals but also introduces noise due to skewed data. To address this, we propose a hierarchical knowledge extraction mechanism (HKE) to model the sample discrepancy within the target task tower. Finally, to maximize the utility of unlabeled samples, we incorporate ranking loss strategy to further enhance our model.

The current generation of agent memory systems treats memory as an external layer that extracts salient snippets from conversations, stores them in vector or graph-based stores, and retrieves top-k items into the prompt of an otherwise stateless model. While these systems improve personalization and context carry-over, they still blur the line between evidence and inference, struggle to organize information over long horizons, and offer limited support for agents that must explain their reasoning. We present Hindsight, a memory architecture that treats agent memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning by organizing it into four logical networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. This framework supports three core operations -- retain, recall, and reflect -- that govern how information is added, accessed, and updated. Under this abstraction, a temporal, entity aware memory layer incrementally turns conversational streams into a structured, queryable memory bank, while a reflection layer reasons over this bank to produce answers and to update information in a traceable way. On key long-horizon conversational memory benchmarks like LongMemEval and LoCoMo, Hindsight with an open-source 20B model lifts overall accuracy from 39% to 83.6% over a full-context baseline with the same backbone and outperforms full context GPT-4o. Scaling the backbone further pushes Hindsight to 91.4% on LongMemEval and up to 89.61% on LoCoMo (vs. 75.78% for the strongest prior open system), consistently outperforming existing memory architectures on multi-session and open-domain questions.'}

To address this challenging task, we propose Patchify, a simple yet effective patch-wise retrieval framework that offers high performance, scalability, and interpretability without requiring fine-tuning. Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines. Furthermore, we apply Product Quantization for efficient large-scale retrieval and highlight the importance of using informative features during compression, which significantly boosts performance.

We conducted a crowdsourcing user experiment with 394 participants comparing four source presentation designs that varied citation visibility and accessibility: collapsible lists, hover cards, footer lists, and aligned this http URL-visibility interfaces generated substantially more hovering on sources, though clicking remained infrequent across all conditions. While interface design showed limited effects on user experience and perception measures, it significantly influenced knowledge, interest, and agreement changes. High-visibility interfaces initially reduced knowledge gain and interest, but these positive effects emerged with increasing source usage. The sidebar condition uniquely increased agreement change. Our findings demonstrate that source presentation alone may not enhance engagement and can even reduce it when insufficient sources are provided.'}
