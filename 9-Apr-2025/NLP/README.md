# LExT: Towards Evaluating Trustworthiness of Natural Language Explanations 

**Authors**: Krithi Shailya, Shreya Rajpal, Gokul S Krishnan, Balaraman Ravindran  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06227)  

**Abstract**: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into high-stakes domains, there have been several approaches proposed toward generating natural language explanations. These explanations are crucial for enhancing the interpretability of a model, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare, where transparency and reliability are key. In light of such explanations being generated by LLMs and its known concerns, there is a growing need for robust evaluation frameworks to assess model-generated explanations. Natural Language Generation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE capture syntactic and semantic accuracies but overlook other crucial aspects such as factual accuracy, consistency, and faithfulness. To address this gap, we propose a general framework for quantifying trustworthiness of natural language explanations, balancing Plausibility and Faithfulness, to derive a comprehensive Language Explanation Trustworthiness Score (LExT) (The code and set up to reproduce our experiments are publicly available at this https URL). Applying our domain-agnostic framework to the healthcare domain using public medical datasets, we evaluate six models, including domain-specific and general-purpose models. Our findings demonstrate significant differences in their ability to generate trustworthy explanations. On comparing these explanations, we make interesting observations such as inconsistencies in Faithfulness demonstrated by general-purpose models and their tendency to outperform domain-specific fine-tuned models. This work further highlights the importance of using a tailored evaluation framework to assess natural language explanations in sensitive fields, providing a foundation for improving the trustworthiness and transparency of language models in healthcare and beyond.

# Encoder-Decoder Gemma: Improving the Quality-Efficiency Trade-Off via Adaptation 

**Authors**: Biao Zhang, Fedor Moiseev, Joshua Ainslie, Paul Suganthan, Min Ma, Surya Bhupatiraju, Fede Lebron, Orhan Firat, Armand Joulin, Zhe Dong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06225)  

**Abstract**: While decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive results, encoder-decoder models are still widely adopted in real-world applications for their inference efficiency and richer encoder representation. In this paper, we study a novel problem: adapting pretrained decoder-only LLMs to encoder-decoder, with the goal of leveraging the strengths of both approaches to achieve a more favorable quality-efficiency trade-off. We argue that adaptation not only enables inheriting the capability of decoder-only LLMs but also reduces the demand for computation compared to pretraining from scratch. We rigorously explore different pretraining objectives and parameter initialization/optimization techniques. Through extensive experiments based on Gemma 2 (2B and 9B) and a suite of newly pretrained mT5-sized models (up to 1.6B), we demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptation and the advantage of encoder-decoder LLMs. Under similar inference budget, encoder-decoder LLMs achieve comparable (often better) pretraining performance but substantially better finetuning performance than their decoder-only counterpart. For example, Gemma 2B-2B outperforms Gemma 2B by $\sim$7\% after instruction tuning. Encoder-decoder adaptation also allows for flexible combination of different-sized models, where Gemma 9B-2B significantly surpasses Gemma 2B-2B by $>$3\%. The adapted encoder representation also yields better results on SuperGLUE. We will release our checkpoints to facilitate future research.

# Can Performant LLMs Be Ethical? Quantifying the Impact of Web Crawling Opt-Outs 

**Authors**: Dongyang Fan, Vinko Sabolčec, Matin Ansaripour, Ayush Kumar Tarun, Martin Jaggi, Antoine Bosselut, Imanol Schlag  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06219)  

**Abstract**: The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG). However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training practices and policy decisions.

# From 128K to 4M: Efficient Training of Ultra-Long Context Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Chejian Xu, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Zihan Liu, Boxin Wang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bo Li, Bryan Catanzaro  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06214)  

**Abstract**: Long-context capabilities are essential for a wide range of applications, including document and video understanding, in-context learning, and inference-time scaling, all of which require models to process and reason over long sequences of text and multimodal data. In this work, we introduce a efficient training recipe for building ultra-long context LLMs from aligned instruct model, pushing the boundaries of context lengths from 128K to 1M, 2M, and 4M tokens. Our approach leverages efficient continued pretraining strategies to extend the context window and employs effective instruction tuning to maintain the instruction-following and reasoning abilities. Our UltraLong-8B, built on Llama3.1-Instruct with our recipe, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of long-context benchmarks. Importantly, models trained with our approach maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating balanced improvements for both long and short context tasks. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key design choices, highlighting the impacts of scaling strategies and data composition. Our findings establish a robust framework for efficiently scaling context lengths while preserving general model capabilities. We release all model weights at: this https URL.

# Assessing how hyperparameters impact Large Language Models' sarcasm detection performance 

**Authors**: Montgomery Gole, Andriy Miranskyy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06166)  

**Abstract**: Sarcasm detection is challenging for both humans and machines. This work explores how model characteristics impact sarcasm detection in OpenAI's GPT, and Meta's Llama-2 models, given their strong natural language understanding, and popularity. We evaluate fine-tuned and zero-shot models across various sizes, releases, and hyperparameters. Experiments were conducted on the political and balanced (pol-bal) portion of the popular Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC2.0) sarcasm dataset. Fine-tuned performance improves monotonically with model size within a model family, while hyperparameter tuning also impacts performance. In the fine-tuning scenario, full precision Llama-2-13b achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and $F_1$-score, both measured at 0.83, comparable to average human performance. In the zero-shot setting, one GPT-4 model achieves competitive performance to prior attempts, yielding an accuracy of 0.70 and an $F_1$-score of 0.75. Furthermore, a model's performance may increase or decline with each release, highlighting the need to reassess performance after each release.

# Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups 

**Authors**: Rijul Magu, Arka Dutta, Sean Kim, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh, Munmun De Choudhury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06160)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.

# Confidence Regularized Masked Language Modeling using Text Length 

**Authors**: Seunghyun Ji, Soowon Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06037)  

**Abstract**: Masked language modeling, which is a task to predict a randomly masked word in the input text, is an efficient language representation learning method. Masked language modeling ignores various words which people can think of for filling in the masked position and calculates the loss with a single word. Especially when the input text is short, the entropy of the word distribution that can fill in the masked position can be high. This may cause the model to be overconfident in the single answer. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence regularizer that controls regularizing strength dynamically by the input text length. Experiments with GLUE and SQuAD datasets showed that our method achieves better accuracy and lower expected calibration error.

# Multi-Sense Embeddings for Language Models and Knowledge Distillation 

**Authors**: Qitong Wang, Mohammed J. Zaki, Georgios Kollias, Vasileios Kalantzis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06036)  

**Abstract**: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) rely on contextual embeddings which generate different (continuous) representations for the same token depending on its surrounding context. Nonetheless, words and tokens typically have a limited number of senses (or meanings). We propose multi-sense embeddings as a drop-in replacement for each token in order to capture the range of their uses in a language. To construct a sense embedding dictionary, we apply a clustering algorithm to embeddings generated by an LLM and consider the cluster centers as representative sense embeddings. In addition, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method that leverages the sense dictionary to learn a smaller student model that mimics the senses from the much larger base LLM model, offering significant space and inference time savings, while maintaining competitive performance. Via thorough experiments on various benchmarks, we showcase the effectiveness of our sense embeddings and knowledge distillation approach. We share our code at this https URL

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06011)  

**Abstract**: Developing high-quality large language models (LLMs) for moderately resourced languages presents unique challenges in data availability, model adaptation, and evaluation. We introduce Llama-3-Nanda-10B-Chat, or Nanda for short, a state-of-the-art Hindi-centric instruction-tuned generative LLM, designed to push the boundaries of open-source Hindi language models. Built upon Llama-3-8B, Nanda incorporates continuous pre-training with expanded transformer blocks, leveraging the Llama Pro methodology. A key challenge was the limited availability of high-quality Hindi text data; we addressed this through rigorous data curation, augmentation, and strategic bilingual training, balancing Hindi and English corpora to optimize cross-linguistic knowledge transfer. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda stands among the top-performing open-source Hindi and multilingual models of similar scale, demonstrating significant advantages over many existing models. We provide an in-depth discussion of training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, safety alignment, and evaluation metrics, demonstrating how these approaches enabled Nanda to achieve state-of-the-art results. By open-sourcing Nanda, we aim to advance research in Hindi LLMs and support a wide range of real-world applications across academia, industry, and public services.

# NativQA Framework: Enabling LLMs with Native, Local, and Everyday Knowledge 

**Authors**: Firoj Alam, Md Arid Hasan, Sahinur Rahman Laskar, Mucahid Kutlu, Shammur Absar Chowdhury  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05995)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about cultural bias, fairness, and their applicability in diverse linguistic and underrepresented regional contexts. To enhance and benchmark the capabilities of LLMs, there is a need to develop large-scale resources focused on multilingual, local, and cultural contexts. In this study, we propose a framework, NativQA, that can seamlessly construct large-scale, culturally and regionally aligned QA datasets in native languages. The framework utilizes user-defined seed queries and leverages search engines to collect location-specific, everyday information. It has been evaluated across 39 locations in 24 countries and in 7 languages, ranging from extremely low-resource to high-resource languages, which resulted over 300K Question Answer (QA) pairs. The developed resources can be used for LLM benchmarking and further fine-tuning. The framework has been made publicly available for the community (this https URL).

# Unsupervised Location Mapping for Narrative Corpora 

**Authors**: Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05954)  

**Abstract**: This work presents the task of unsupervised location mapping, which seeks to map the trajectory of an individual narrative on a spatial map of locations in which a large set of narratives take place. Despite the fundamentality and generality of the task, very little work addressed the spatial mapping of narrative texts. The task consists of two parts: (1) inducing a ``map'' with the locations mentioned in a set of texts, and (2) extracting a trajectory from a single narrative and positioning it on the map. Following recent advances in increasing the context length of large language models, we propose a pipeline for this task in a completely unsupervised manner without predefining the set of labels. We test our method on two different domains: (1) Holocaust testimonies and (2) Lake District writing, namely multi-century literature on travels in the English Lake District. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for the task, with encouraging results, thereby setting a benchmark and evaluation practices for the task, as well as highlighting challenges.

**Authors**: Abhiram Reddy Yanampally  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05914)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel approach to constructing an English-to-Telugu translation model by leveraging transfer learning techniques and addressing the challenges associated with low-resource languages. Utilizing the Bharat Parallel Corpus Collection (BPCC) as the primary dataset, the model incorporates iterative backtranslation to generate synthetic parallel data, effectively augmenting the training dataset and enhancing the model's translation capabilities. The research focuses on a comprehensive strategy for improving model performance through data augmentation, optimization of training parameters, and the effective use of pre-trained models. These methodologies aim to create a robust translation system that can handle diverse sentence structures and linguistic nuances in both English and Telugu. This work highlights the significance of innovative data handling techniques and the potential of transfer learning in overcoming limitations posed by sparse datasets in low-resource languages. The study contributes to the field of machine translation and seeks to improve communication between English and Telugu speakers in practical contexts.

# Assessing Thai Dialect Performance in LLMs with Automatic Benchmarks and Human Evaluation 

**Authors**: Peerat Limkonchotiwat, Kanruethai Masuk, Surapon Nonesung, Chalermpun Mai-On, Sarana Nutanong, Wuttikorn Ponwitayarat, Potsawee Manakul  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05898)  

**Abstract**: Large language models show promising results in various NLP tasks. Despite these successes, the robustness and consistency of LLMs in underrepresented languages remain largely unexplored, especially concerning local dialects. Existing benchmarks also focus on main dialects, neglecting LLMs' ability on local dialect texts. In this paper, we introduce a Thai local dialect benchmark covering Northern (Lanna), Northeastern (Isan), and Southern (Dambro) Thai, evaluating LLMs on five NLP tasks: summarization, question answering, translation, conversation, and food-related tasks. Furthermore, we propose a human evaluation guideline and metric for Thai local dialects to assess generation fluency and dialect-specific accuracy. Results show that LLM performance declines significantly in local Thai dialects compared to standard Thai, with only proprietary models like GPT-4o and Gemini2 demonstrating some fluency

# Enhancing Coreference Resolution with Pretrained Language Models: Bridging the Gap Between Syntax and Semantics 

**Authors**: Xingzu Liu, Songhang deng, Mingbang Wang, Zhang Dong, Le Dai, Jiyuan Li, Ruilin Nong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05855)  

**Abstract**: Large language models have made significant advancements in various natural language processing tasks, including coreference resolution. However, traditional methods often fall short in effectively distinguishing referential relationships due to a lack of integration between syntactic and semantic information. This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at enhancing coreference resolution by utilizing pretrained language models. Our approach combines syntax parsing with semantic role labeling to accurately capture finer distinctions in referential relationships. By employing state-of-the-art pretrained models to gather contextual embeddings and applying an attention mechanism for fine-tuning, we improve the performance of coreference tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets show that our method surpasses conventional coreference resolution systems, achieving notable accuracy in disambiguating references. This development not only improves coreference resolution outcomes but also positively impacts other natural language processing tasks that depend on precise referential understanding.

# Leveraging Robust Optimization for LLM Alignment under Distribution Shifts 

**Authors**: Mingye Zhu, Yi Liu, Junbo Guo, Quan Wang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05831)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on preference alignment methods to steer outputs toward human values, yet these methods are often constrained by the scarcity of high-quality human-annotated data. To tackle this, recent approaches have turned to synthetic data generated by LLMs as a scalable alternative. However, synthetic data can introduce distribution shifts, compromising the nuanced human preferences that are essential for desirable outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-aware optimization framework that improves preference alignment in the presence of such shifts. Our approach first estimates the likelihood ratios between the target and training distributions leveraging a learned classifier, then it minimizes the worst-case loss over data regions that reflect the target human-preferred distribution. By explicitly prioritizing the target distribution during optimization, our method mitigates the adverse effects of distributional variation and enhances the generation of responses that faithfully reflect human values.

**Authors**: Zhang Dong, Songhang deng, Mingbang Wang, Le Dai, Jiyuan Li, Xingzu Liu, Ruilin Nong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05824)  

**Abstract**: Large-scale coreference resolution presents a significant challenge in natural language processing, necessitating a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In response to this challenge, we introduce an End-to-End Neural Coreference Resolution system tailored for large-scale applications.

# Cross-Document Contextual Coreference Resolution in Knowledge Graphs 

**Authors**: Zhang Dong, Mingbang Wang, Songhang deng, Le Dai, Jiyuan Li, Xingzu Liu, Ruilin Nong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05767)  

**Abstract**: Coreference resolution across multiple documents poses a significant challenge in natural language processing, particularly within the domain of knowledge graphs. This study introduces an innovative method aimed at identifying and resolving references to the same entities that appear across differing texts, thus enhancing the coherence and collaboration of information. Our method employs a dynamic linking mechanism that associates entities in the knowledge graph with their corresponding textual mentions. By utilizing contextual embeddings along with graph-based inference strategies, we effectively capture the relationships and interactions among entities, thereby improving the accuracy of coreference resolution. Rigorous evaluations on various benchmark datasets highlight notable advancements in our approach over traditional methodologies. The results showcase how the contextual information derived from knowledge graphs enhances the understanding of complex relationships across documents, leading to better entity linking and information extraction capabilities in applications driven by knowledge. Our technique demonstrates substantial improvements in both precision and recall, underscoring its effectiveness in the area of cross-document coreference resolution.

# Probabilistic Process Discovery with Stochastic Process Trees 

**Authors**: András Horváth, Paolo Ballarini, Pierre Cry  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05765)  

**Abstract**: In order to obtain a stochastic model that accounts for the stochastic aspects of the dynamics of a business process, usually the following steps are taken. Given an event log, a process tree is obtained through a process discovery algorithm, i.e., a process tree that is aimed at reproducing, as accurately as possible, the language of the log. The process tree is then transformed into a Petri net that generates the same set of sequences as the process tree. In order to capture the frequency of the sequences in the event log, weights are assigned to the transitions of the Petri net, resulting in a stochastic Petri net with a stochastic language in which each sequence is associated with a probability. In this paper we show that this procedure has unfavorable properties. First, the weights assigned to the transitions of the Petri net have an unclear role in the resulting stochastic language. We will show that a weight can have multiple, ambiguous impact on the probability of the sequences generated by the Petri net. Second, a number of different Petri nets with different number of transitions can correspond to the same process tree. This means that the number of parameters (the number of weights) that determines the stochastic language is not well-defined. In order to avoid these ambiguities, in this paper, we propose to add stochasticity directly to process trees. The result is a new formalism, called stochastic process trees, in which the number of parameters and their role in the associated stochastic language is clear and well-defined.

# Layer-Aware Embedding Fusion for LLMs in Text Classifications 

**Authors**: Jiho Gwak, Yuchul Jung  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05764)  

**Abstract**: Embedding fusion has emerged as an effective approach for enhancing performance across various NLP tasks. However, systematic guidelines for selecting optimal layers and developing effective fusion strategies for the integration of LLMs remain underexplored. In this study, we propose a layer-aware embedding selection method and investigate how to quantitatively evaluate different layers to identify the most important ones for downstream NLP tasks, showing that the critical layers vary depending on the dataset. We also explore how combining embeddings from multiple LLMs, without requiring model fine-tuning, can improve performance. Experiments on four English text classification datasets (SST-2, MR, R8, and R52) demonstrate that different layers in LLMs exhibit varying degrees of representational strength for classification, and that combining embeddings from different models can enhance performance if the models exhibit complementary characteristics. Additionally, we discuss resources overhead (memory and inference time) to provide a balanced perspective on the real world feasibility of embedding fusion. Future work will explore multilingual and domain specific datasets, as well as techniques for automating layer selection, to improve both performance and scalability.

# RETROcode: Leveraging a Code Database for Improved Natural Language to Code Generation 

**Authors**: Nathanaël Beau, Benoît Crabbé  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05759)  

**Abstract**: As text and code resources have expanded, large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising capabilities in code generation tasks, typically employing supervised fine-tuning with problem statement-program pairs. However, increasing model size and data volume for performance gains also raises computational demands and risks of overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we present RETROcode, a novel adaptation of the RETRO architecture \cite{RETRO} for sequence-to-sequence models, utilizing a large code database as an auxiliary scaling method. This approach, diverging from simply enlarging model and dataset sizes, allows RETROcode to leverage a vast code database for prediction, enhancing the model's efficiency by integrating extensive memory. Our findings indicate that RETROcode not only outperforms similar-sized traditional architectures on test sets but also approaches the effectiveness of the much larger Codex model, despite being trained from scratch on a substantially smaller dataset.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05747)  

**Abstract**: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning, alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA community.

# Rank-Then-Score: Enhancing Large Language Models for Automated Essay Scoring 

**Authors**: Yida Cai, Kun Liang, Sanwoo Lee, Qinghan Wang, Yunfang Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05736)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a variety of tasks. However, their potential in the domain of Automated Essay Scoring (AES) remains largely underexplored. Moreover, compared to English data, the methods for Chinese AES is not well developed. In this paper, we propose Rank-Then-Score (RTS), a fine-tuning framework based on large language models to enhance their essay scoring capabilities. Specifically, we fine-tune the ranking model (Ranker) with feature-enriched data, and then feed the output of the ranking model, in the form of a candidate score set, with the essay content into the scoring model (Scorer) to produce the final score. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, HSK and ASAP, demonstrate that RTS consistently outperforms the direct prompting (Vanilla) method in terms of average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, and achieves the best performance on Chinese essay scoring using the HSK dataset.

# LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2: Entropy-Driven Convolutional Test-Time Scaling for Generating Long-Form Articles from Extremely Long Resources 

**Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Yujia Fu, Zhu Zhang, Shuo Wang, Zirui Ren, Xiaorong Wang, Zhili Li, Chaoqun He, Bo An, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05732)  

**Abstract**: Long-form generation is crucial for a wide range of practical applications, typically categorized into short-to-long and long-to-long generation. While short-to-long generations have received considerable attention, generating long texts from extremely long resources remains relatively underexplored. The primary challenge in long-to-long generation lies in effectively integrating and analyzing relevant information from extensive inputs, which remains difficult for current large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2, a novel test-time scaling strategy designed to enhance the ability of LLMs to process extremely long inputs. Drawing inspiration from convolutional neural networks, which iteratively integrate local features into higher-level global representations, LLM$\times$MapReduce-V2 utilizes stacked convolutional scaling layers to progressively expand the understanding of input materials. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the ability of LLMs to process long inputs and generate coherent, informative long-form articles, outperforming several representative baselines.

# Evaluating Speech-to-Text Systems with PennSound 

**Authors**: Jonathan Wright, Mark Liberman, Neville Ryant, James Fiumara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05702)  

**Abstract**: A random sample of nearly 10 hours of speech from PennSound, the world's largest online collection of poetry readings and discussions, was used as a benchmark to evaluate several commercial and open-source speech-to-text systems. PennSound's wide variation in recording conditions and speech styles makes it a good representative for many other untranscribed audio collections. Reference transcripts were created by trained annotators, and system transcripts were produced from AWS, Azure, Google, IBM, NeMo, this http URL, Whisper, and this http URL. Based on word error rate, this http URL was the top performer, and Whisper was the top open source performer (as long as hallucinations were avoided). AWS had the best diarization error rates among three systems. However, WER and DER differences were slim, and various tradeoffs may motivate choosing different systems for different end users. We also examine the issue of hallucinations in Whisper. Users of Whisper should be cautioned to be aware of runtime options, and whether the speed vs accuracy trade off is acceptable.

# STRIVE: A Think & Improve Approach with Iterative Refinement for Enhancing Question Quality Estimation 

**Authors**: Aniket Deroy, Subhankar Maity  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05693)  

**Abstract**: Automatically assessing question quality is crucial for educators as it saves time, ensures consistency, and provides immediate feedback for refining teaching materials. We propose a novel methodology called STRIVE (Structured Thinking and Refinement with multiLLMs for Improving Verified Question Estimation) using a series of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic question evaluation. This approach aims to improve the accuracy and depth of question quality assessment, ultimately supporting diverse learners and enhancing educational practices. The method estimates question quality in an automated manner by generating multiple evaluations based on the strengths and weaknesses of the provided question and then choosing the best solution generated by the LLM. Then the process is improved by iterative review and response with another LLM until the evaluation metric values converge. This sophisticated method of evaluating question quality improves the estimation of question quality by automating the task of question quality evaluation. Correlation scores show that using this proposed method helps to improve correlation with human judgments compared to the baseline method. Error analysis shows that metrics like relevance and appropriateness improve significantly relative to human judgments by using STRIVE.

# Separator Injection Attack: Uncovering Dialogue Biases in Large Language Models Caused by Role Separators 

**Authors**: Xitao Li, Haijun Wang, Jiang Wu, Ting Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05689)  

**Abstract**: Conversational large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread attention due to their instruction-following capabilities. To ensure conversational LLMs follow instructions, role separators are employed to distinguish between different participants in a conversation. However, incorporating role separators introduces potential vulnerabilities. Misusing roles can lead to prompt injection attacks, which can easily misalign the model's behavior with the user's intentions, raising significant security concerns. Although various prompt injection attacks have been proposed, recent research has largely overlooked the impact of role separators on safety. This highlights the critical need to thoroughly understand the systemic weaknesses in dialogue systems caused by role separators. This paper identifies modeling weaknesses caused by role separators. Specifically, we observe a strong positional bias associated with role separators, which is inherent in the format of dialogue modeling and can be triggered by the insertion of role separators. We further develop the Separators Injection Attack (SIA), a new orthometric attack based on role separators. The experiment results show that SIA is efficient and extensive in manipulating model behavior with an average gain of 18.2% for manual methods and enhances the attack success rate to 100% with automatic methods.

# Towards Smarter Hiring: Are Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Pre-trained LLMs Ready for HR Spoken Interview Transcript Analysis? 

**Authors**: Subhankar Maity, Aniket Deroy, Sudeshna Sarkar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05683)  

**Abstract**: This research paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance of prominent pre-trained large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, text-davinci-003, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, text-ada-001, llama-2-7b-chat, llama-2-13b-chat, and llama-2-70b-chat, in comparison to expert human evaluators in providing scores, identifying errors, and offering feedback and improvement suggestions to candidates during mock HR (Human Resources) interviews. We introduce a dataset called HURIT (Human Resource Interview Transcripts), which comprises 3,890 HR interview transcripts sourced from real-world HR interview scenarios. Our findings reveal that pre-trained LLMs, particularly GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-3.5 Turbo, exhibit commendable performance and are capable of producing evaluations comparable to those of expert human evaluators. Although these LLMs demonstrate proficiency in providing scores comparable to human experts in terms of human evaluation metrics, they frequently fail to identify errors and offer specific actionable advice for candidate performance improvement in HR interviews. Our research suggests that the current state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs are not fully conducive for automatic deployment in an HR interview assessment. Instead, our findings advocate for a human-in-the-loop approach, to incorporate manual checks for inconsistencies and provisions for improving feedback quality as a more suitable strategy.

# Leveraging Prompt-Tuning for Bengali Grammatical Error Explanation Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Subhankar Maity, Aniket Deroy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05642)  

**Abstract**: We propose a novel three-step prompt-tuning method for Bengali Grammatical Error Explanation (BGEE) using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Llama-2-70b. Our approach involves identifying and categorizing grammatical errors in Bengali sentences, generating corrected versions of the sentences, and providing natural language explanations for each identified error. We evaluate the performance of our BGEE system using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation conducted by experienced Bengali language experts. Our proposed prompt-tuning approach shows that GPT-4, the best performing LLM, surpasses the baseline model in automated evaluation metrics, with a 5.26% improvement in F1 score and a 6.95% improvement in exact match. Furthermore, compared to the previous baseline, GPT-4 demonstrates a decrease of 25.51% in wrong error type and a decrease of 26.27% in wrong error explanation. However, the results still lag behind the human baseline.

# DBOT: Artificial Intelligence for Systematic Long-Term Investing 

**Authors**: Vasant Dhar, João Sedoc  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05639)  

**Abstract**: Long-term investing was previously seen as requiring human judgment. With the advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems, automated systematic long-term investing is now feasible. In this paper, we present DBOT, a system whose goal is to reason about valuation like Aswath Damodaran, who is a unique expert in the investment arena in terms of having published thousands of valuations on companies in addition to his numerous writings on the topic, which provide ready training data for an AI system. DBOT can value any publicly traded company. DBOT can also be back-tested, making its behavior and performance amenable to scientific inquiry. We compare DBOT to its analytic parent, Damodaran, and highlight the research challenges involved in raising its current capability to that of Damodaran's. Finally, we examine the implications of DBOT-like AI agents for the financial industry, especially how they will impact the role of human analysts in valuation.

# Reasoning Towards Fairness: Mitigating Bias in Language Models through Reasoning-Guided Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Sanchit Kabra, Akshita Jha, Chandan Reddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05632)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large-scale generative language models have shown that reasoning capabilities can significantly improve model performance across a variety of tasks. However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws.

# Two Intermediate Translations Are Better Than One: Fine-tuning LLMs for Document-level Translation Refinement 

**Authors**: Yichen Dong, Xinglin Lyu, Junhui Li, Daimeng Wei, Min Zhang, Shimin Tao, Hao Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05614)  

**Abstract**: Recent research has shown that large language models (LLMs) can enhance translation quality through self-refinement. In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases. Experimental results across ten translation tasks with LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

# FactGuard: Leveraging Multi-Agent Systems to Generate Answerable and Unanswerable Questions for Enhanced Long-Context LLM Extraction 

**Authors**: Qian-Wen Zhang, Fang Li, Jie Wang, Lingfeng Qiao, Yifei Yu, Di Yin, Xing Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05607)  

**Abstract**: Extractive reading comprehension systems are designed to locate the correct answer to a question within a given text. However, a persistent challenge lies in ensuring these models maintain high accuracy in answering questions while reliably recognizing unanswerable queries. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs.

# On the Impact of Language Nuances on Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models: Paraphrasing, Sarcasm, and Emojis 

**Authors**: Naman Bhargava, Mohammed I. Radaideh, O Hwang Kwon, Aditi Verma, Majdi I. Radaideh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05603)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, data quality--particularly when sourced from social media--can significantly impact their accuracy. This research explores how textual nuances, including emojis and sarcasm, affect sentiment analysis, with a particular focus on improving data quality through text paraphrasing techniques. To address the lack of labeled sarcasm data, the authors created a human-labeled dataset of 5929 tweets that enabled the assessment of LLM in various sarcasm contexts. The results show that when topic-specific datasets, such as those related to nuclear power, are used to finetune LLMs these models are not able to comprehend accurate sentiment in presence of sarcasm due to less diverse text, requiring external interventions like sarcasm removal to boost model accuracy. Sarcasm removal led to up to 21% improvement in sentiment accuracy, as LLMs trained on nuclear power-related content struggled with sarcastic tweets, achieving only 30% accuracy. In contrast, LLMs trained on general tweet datasets, covering a broader range of topics, showed considerable improvements in predicting sentiment for sarcastic tweets (60% accuracy), indicating that incorporating general text data can enhance sarcasm detection. The study also utilized adversarial text augmentation, showing that creating synthetic text variants by making minor changes significantly increased model robustness and accuracy for sarcastic tweets (approximately 85%). Additionally, text paraphrasing of tweets with fragmented language transformed around 40% of the tweets with low-confidence labels into high-confidence ones, improving LLMs sentiment analysis accuracy by 6%.

# DEL: Context-Aware Dynamic Exit Layer for Efficient Self-Speculative Decoding 

**Authors**: Hossein Entezari Zarch, Lei Gao, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavaram  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05598)  

**Abstract**: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality. It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification. While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce DEL, a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\times$$\sim$$2.50\times$ over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon the state-of-the-art SD methods by up to $0.27\times$.

# Knowledge-Instruct: Effective Continual Pre-training from Limited Data using Instructions 

**Authors**: Oded Ovadia, Meni Brief, Rachel Lemberg, Eitam Sheetrit  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05571)  

**Abstract**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge during pre-training, they often lack domain-specific, new, or niche information. Continual pre-training (CPT) attempts to address this gap but suffers from catastrophic forgetting and inefficiencies in low-data regimes. We introduce Knowledge-Instruct, a novel approach to efficiently inject knowledge from limited corpora through pure instruction-tuning. By generating information-dense synthetic instruction data, it effectively integrates new knowledge while preserving general reasoning and instruction-following abilities. Knowledge-Instruct demonstrates superior factual memorization, minimizes catastrophic forgetting, and remains scalable by leveraging synthetic data from relatively small language models. Additionally, it enhances contextual understanding, including complex multi-hop reasoning, facilitating integration with retrieval systems. We validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, including Companies, a new dataset that we release to measure knowledge injection capabilities.

# Can Large Language Models Match Tutoring System Adaptivity? A Benchmarking Study 

**Authors**: Conrad Borchers, Tianze Shou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05570)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise as dynamic instructional aids. Yet, it remains unclear whether LLMs can replicate the adaptivity of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS)--where student knowledge and pedagogical strategies are explicitly modeled. We propose a prompt variation framework to assess LLM-generated instructional moves' adaptivity and pedagogical soundness across 75 real-world tutoring scenarios from an ITS. We systematically remove key context components (e.g., student errors and knowledge components) from prompts to create variations of each scenario. Three representative LLMs (Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B, and GPT-4o) generate 1,350 instructional moves. We use text embeddings and randomization tests to measure how the omission of each context feature impacts the LLMs' outputs (adaptivity) and a validated tutor-training classifier to evaluate response quality (pedagogical soundness). Surprisingly, even the best-performing model only marginally mimics the adaptivity of ITS. Specifically, Llama3-70B demonstrates statistically significant adaptivity to student errors. Although Llama3-8B's recommendations receive higher pedagogical soundness scores than the other models, it struggles with instruction-following behaviors, including output formatting. By contrast, GPT-4o reliably adheres to instructions but tends to provide overly direct feedback that diverges from effective tutoring, prompting learners with open-ended questions to gauge knowledge. Given these results, we discuss how current LLM-based tutoring is unlikely to produce learning benefits rivaling known-to-be-effective ITS tutoring. Through our open-source benchmarking code, we contribute a reproducible method for evaluating LLMs' instructional adaptivity and fidelity.

**Authors**: M-A-P Team, Siwei Wu, Jincheng Ren, Xinrun Du, Shuyue Guo, Xingwei Qu, Yiming Liang, Jie Liu, Yunwen Li, Tianyu Zheng, Boyu Feng, Huaqing Yuan, Zenith Wang, Jiaheng Liu, Wenhao Huang, Chenglin Cai, Haoran Que, Jian Yang, Yuelin Bai, Zekun Moore Wang, Zhouliang Yu, Qunshu Lin, Ding Pan, Yuchen Jiang, Tiannan Wang, Wangchunshu Zhou, Shenzhi Wang, Xingyuan Bu, Minghao Liu, Guoyin Wang, Ge Zhang, Chenghua Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05535)  

**Abstract**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has achieved remarkable success. However, existing Chinese preference datasets are limited by small scale, narrow domain coverage, and lack of rigorous data validation. Additionally, the reliance on human annotators for instruction and response labeling significantly constrains the scalability of human preference datasets. To address these challenges, we design an LLM-based Chinese preference dataset annotation pipeline with no human intervention. Specifically, we crawled and carefully filtered 92k high-quality Chinese queries and employed 15 mainstream LLMs to generate and score chosen-rejected response pairs. Based on it, we introduce COIG-P (Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Preference), a high-quality, large-scale Chinese preference dataset, comprises 1,009k Chinese preference pairs spanning 6 diverse domains: Chat, Code, Math, Logic, Novel, and Role. Building upon COIG-P, to reduce the overhead of using LLMs for scoring, we trained a 8B-sized Chinese Reward Model (CRM) and meticulously constructed a Chinese Reward Benchmark (CRBench). Evaluation results based on AlignBench \citep{liu2024alignbenchbenchmarkingchinesealignment} show that that COIG-P significantly outperforms other Chinese preference datasets, and it brings significant performance improvements ranging from 2% to 12% for the Qwen2/2.5 and Infinity-Instruct-3M-0625 model series, respectively. The results on CRBench demonstrate that our CRM has a strong and robust scoring ability. We apply it to filter chosen-rejected response pairs in a test split of COIG-P, and our experiments show that it is comparable to GPT-4o in identifying low-quality samples while maintaining efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our codes and data are released in this https URL.

**Authors**: Despina Tomkou, George Fatouros, Andreas Andreou, Georgios Makridis, Fotis Liarokapis, Dimitrios Dardanis, Athanasios Kiourtis, John Soldatos, Dimosthenis Kyriazis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05527)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR) technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free, context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction. Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities, and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and resilient approach to industrial development.

# Pretraining Language Models for Diachronic Linguistic Change Discovery 

**Authors**: Elisabeth Fittschen, Sabrina Li, Tom Lippincott, Leshem Choshsem, Craig Messner  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05523)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential as tools for scientific discovery. This has engendered growing interest in their use in humanistic disciplines, such as historical linguistics and literary studies. These fields often construct arguments on the basis of delineations like genre, or more inflexibly, time period. Although efforts have been made to restrict inference to specific domains via fine-tuning or model editing, we posit that the only true guarantee is domain-restricted pretraining -- typically, a data- and compute-expensive proposition.
We show that efficient pretraining techniques can produce useful models over corpora too large for easy manual inspection but too small for "typical" LLM approaches. We employ a novel date-attribution pipeline in order to obtain a temporally-segmented dataset of five 10-million-word slices. We train two corresponding five-model batteries over these corpus segments, efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter efficiently finetuned.
We find that the pretrained models are faster to train than the finetuned baselines and that they better respect the historical divisions of our corpus. Emphasizing speed and precision over a-historical comprehensiveness enables a number of novel approaches to hypothesis discovery and testing in our target fields. Taking up diachronic linguistics as a testbed, we show that our method enables the detection of a diverse set of phenomena, including en masse lexical change, non-lexical (grammatical and morphological) change, and word sense introduction/obsolescence. We provide a ready-to-use pipeline that allows extension of our approach to other target fields with only minimal adaptation.

# ChartQAPro: A More Diverse and Challenging Benchmark for Chart Question Answering 

**Authors**: Ahmed Masry, Mohammed Saidul Islam, Mahir Ahmed, Aayush Bajaj, Firoz Kabir, Aaryaman Kartha, Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar, Mizanur Rahman, Shadikur Rahman, Mehrad Shahmohammadi, Megh Thakkar, Md Rizwan Parvez, Enamul Hoque, Shafiq Joty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05506)  

**Abstract**: Charts are ubiquitous, as people often use them to analyze data, answer questions, and discover critical insights. However, performing complex analytical tasks with charts requires significant perceptual and cognitive effort. Chart Question Answering (CQA) systems automate this process by enabling models to interpret and reason with visual representations of data. However, existing benchmarks like ChartQA lack real-world diversity and have recently shown performance saturation with modern large vision-language models (LVLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce ChartQAPro, a new benchmark that includes 1,341 charts from 157 diverse sources, spanning various chart types, including infographics and dashboards, and featuring 1,948 questions in various types, such as multiple-choice, conversational, hypothetical, and unanswerable questions, to better reflect real-world challenges. Our evaluations with 21 models show a substantial performance drop for LVLMs on ChartQAPro; e.g., Claude Sonnet 3.5 scores 90.5% on ChartQA but only 55.81% on ChartQAPro, underscoring the complexity of chart reasoning. We complement our findings with detailed error analyses and ablation studies, identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing LVLMs in chart understanding and reasoning. We release ChartQAPro at this https URL.

**Abstract**: Hypothesis generation is a fundamental step in scientific discovery, yet it is increasingly challenged by information overload and disciplinary fragmentation. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in their potential to enhance and automate this process. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of hypothesis generation with LLMs by (i) reviewing existing methods, from simple prompting techniques to more complex frameworks, and proposing a taxonomy that categorizes these approaches; (ii) analyzing techniques for improving hypothesis quality, such as novelty boosting and structured reasoning; (iii) providing an overview of evaluation strategies; and (iv) discussing key challenges and future directions, including multimodal integration and human-AI collaboration. Our survey aims to serve as a reference for researchers exploring LLMs for hypothesis generation.

# PreSumm: Predicting Summarization Performance Without Summarizing 

**Authors**: Steven Koniaev, Ori Ernst, Jackie Chi Kit Cheung  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05420)  

**Abstract**: Despite recent advancements in automatic summarization, state-of-the-art models do not summarize all documents equally well, raising the question: why? While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance. In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document's summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme. In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm's practical utility in two key applications: improving hybrid summarization workflows by identifying documents that require manual summarization and enhancing dataset quality by filtering outliers and noisy documents. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of document properties in summarization performance and offer insights into the limitations of current systems that could serve as the basis for future improvements.

# Less but Better: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models for Personality Detection 

**Authors**: Lingzhi Shen, Yunfei Long, Xiaohao Cai, Guanming Chen, Imran Razzak, Shoaib Jameel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05411)  

**Abstract**: Personality detection automatically identifies an individual's personality from various data sources, such as social media texts. However, as the parameter scale of language models continues to grow, the computational cost becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Fine-tuning also grows more complex, making it harder to justify the effort and reliably predict outcomes. We introduce a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, PersLLM, to address these challenges. In PersLLM, a large language model (LLM) extracts high-dimensional representations from raw data and stores them in a dynamic memory layer. PersLLM then updates the downstream layers with a replaceable output network, enabling flexible adaptation to various personality detection scenarios. By storing the features in the memory layer, we eliminate the need for repeated complex computations by the LLM. Meanwhile, the lightweight output network serves as a proxy for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the framework, improving the predictability of results. Experimental results on key benchmark datasets like Kaggle and Pandora show that PersLLM significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining competitive performance and strong adaptability.

# Fast Controlled Generation from Language Models with Adaptive Weighted Rejection Sampling 

**Authors**: Benjamin Lipkin, Benjamin LeBrun, Jacob Hoover Vigly, João Loula, David R. MacIver, Li Du, Jason Eisner, Ryan Cotterell, Vikash Mansinghka, Timothy J. O'Donnell, Alexander K. Lew, Tim Vieira  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05410)  

**Abstract**: The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models.

# Unequal Opportunities: Examining the Bias in Geographical Recommendations by Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Shiran Dudy, Thulasi Tholeti, Resmi Ramachandranpillai, Muhammad Ali, Toby Jia-Jun Li, Ricardo Baeza-Yates  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05325)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them a popular information-seeking tool among end users. However, the statistical training methods for LLMs have raised concerns about their representation of under-represented topics, potentially leading to biases that could influence real-world decisions and opportunities. These biases could have significant economic, social, and cultural impacts as LLMs become more prevalent, whether through direct interactions--such as when users engage with chatbots or automated assistants--or through their integration into third-party applications (as agents), where the models influence decision-making processes and functionalities behind the scenes. Our study examines the biases present in LLMs recommendations of U.S. cities and towns across three domains: relocation, tourism, and starting a business. We explore two key research questions: (i) How similar LLMs responses are, and (ii) How this similarity might favor areas with certain characteristics over others, introducing biases. We focus on the consistency of LLMs responses and their tendency to over-represent or under-represent specific locations. Our findings point to consistent demographic biases in these recommendations, which could perpetuate a ``rich-get-richer'' effect that widens existing economic disparities.

# Hogwild! Inference: Parallel LLM Generation via Concurrent Attention 

**Authors**: Gleb Rodionov, Roman Garipov, Alina Shutova, George Yakushev, Vage Egiazarian, Anton Sinitsin, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06261)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to tackle increasingly complex tasks through advanced reasoning, long-form content generation, and tool use. Solving these tasks often involves long inference-time computations. In human problem solving, a common strategy to expedite work is collaboration: by dividing the problem into sub-tasks, exploring different strategies concurrently, etc. Recent research has shown that LLMs can also operate in parallel by implementing explicit cooperation frameworks, such as voting mechanisms or the explicit creation of independent sub-tasks that can be executed in parallel. However, each of these frameworks may not be suitable for all types of tasks, which can hinder their applicability. In this work, we propose a different design approach: we run LLM "workers" in parallel , allowing them to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache and prompt these workers to decide how best to collaborate. Our approach allows the instances to come up with their own collaboration strategy for the problem at hand, all the while "seeing" each other's partial progress in the concurrent cache. We implement this approach via Hogwild! Inference: a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run in parallel with the same attention cache, with "instant" access to each other's generated tokens. Hogwild! inference takes advantage of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) to avoid recomputation while improving parallel hardware utilization. We find that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with shared Key-Value cache out of the box, without additional fine-tuning.

**Abstract**: Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics, mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

**Authors**: Eric Wang, Samuel Schmidgall, Paul F. Jaeger, Fan Zhang, Rory Pilgrim, Yossi Matias, Joelle Barral, David Fleet, Shekoofeh Azizi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06196)  

**Abstract**: Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high).

# SkillFlow: Efficient Skill and Code Transfer Through Communication in Adapting AI Agents 

**Authors**: Pagkratios Tagkopoulos, Fangzhou Li, Ilias Tagkopoulos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06188)  

**Abstract**: AI agents are autonomous systems that can execute specific tasks based on predefined programming. Here, we present SkillFlow, a modular, technology-agnostic framework that allows agents to expand their functionality in an ad-hoc fashion by acquiring new skills from their environment or other agents. We present a theoretical model that examines under which conditions this framework would be beneficial, and we then explore SkillFlow's ability to accelerate task completion and lead to lower cumulative costs in a real-world application, namely scheduling agents for calendar events. We demonstrate that within a few iterations, SkillFlow leads to considerable (24.8%, p-value = $6.4\times10^{-3}$) gains in time and cost, especially when the communication cost is high. Finally, we draw analogies from well-studied biological systems and compare this framework to that of lateral gene transfer, a significant process of adaptation and evolution in novel environments.

# Defending Deep Neural Networks against Backdoor Attacks via Module Switching 

**Authors**: Weijun Li, Ansh Arora, Xuanli He, Mark Dras, Qiongkai Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05902)  

**Abstract**: The exponential increase in the parameters of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has significantly raised the cost of independent training, particularly for resource-constrained entities. As a result, there is a growing reliance on open-source models. However, the opacity of training processes exacerbates security risks, making these models more vulnerable to malicious threats, such as backdoor attacks, while simultaneously complicating defense mechanisms. Merging homogeneous models has gained attention as a cost-effective post-training defense. However, we notice that existing strategies, such as weight averaging, only partially mitigate the influence of poisoned parameters and remain ineffective in disrupting the pervasive spurious correlations embedded across model parameters. We propose a novel module-switching strategy to break such spurious correlations within the model's propagation path. By leveraging evolutionary algorithms to optimize fusion strategies, we validate our approach against backdoor attacks targeting text and vision domains. Our method achieves effective backdoor mitigation even when incorporating a couple of compromised models, e.g., reducing the average attack success rate (ASR) to 22% compared to 31.9% with the best-performing baseline on SST-2.

# Are Generative AI Agents Effective Personalized Financial Advisors? 

**Authors**: Takehiro Takayanagi, Kiyoshi Izumi, Javier Sanz-Cruzado, Richard McCreadie, Iadh Ounis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05862)  

**Abstract**: Large language model-based agents are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost mechanism to provide personalized, conversational advice, and have demonstrated impressive capabilities in relatively simple scenarios, such as movie recommendations. But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.

# Retrieval Augmented Generation with Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Text Generation 

**Authors**: Teng Shi, Jun Xu, Xiao Zhang, Xiaoxue Zang, Kai Zheng, Yang Song, Han Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05731)  

**Abstract**: Recently, the personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate content that aligns with individual user preferences has garnered widespread attention. Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant documents from the user's history to reflect their preferences and enhance LLM generation, is one commonly used approach for personalization. However, existing personalized RAG methods do not consider that the histories of similar users can also assist in personalized generation for the current user, meaning that collaborative information between users can also benefit personalized generation. Inspired by the application of collaborative filtering in recommender systems, we propose a method called CFRAG, which adapts Collaborative Filtering to RAG for personalized text generation. However, this presents two challenges: (1)~how to incorporate collaborative information without explicit user similarity labels? (2)~how to retrieve documents that support personalized LLM generation? For Challenge 1, we use contrastive learning to train user embeddings to retrieve similar users and introduce collaborative information. For Challenge 2, we design a personalized retriever and reranker to retrieve the top-$k$ documents from these users' histories. We take into account the user's preference during retrieval and reranking. Then we leverage feedback from the LLM to fine-tune the personalized retriever and reranker, enabling them to retrieve documents that meet the personalized generation needs of the LLM. Experimental results on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the effectiveness of CFRAG. Further analysis confirms the importance of incorporating collaborative information.

# Sugar-Coated Poison: Benign Generation Unlocks LLM Jailbreaking 

**Authors**: Yu-Hang Wu, Yu-Jie Xiong, Jie-Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05652)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to a wide range of applications. However, they still remain the threat of jailbreak attacks, where attackers manipulate designed prompts to make the models elicit malicious outputs. Analyzing jailbreak methods can help us delve into the weakness of LLMs and improve it. In this paper, We reveal a vulnerability in large language models (LLMs), which we term Defense Threshold Decay (DTD), by analyzing the attention weights of the model's output on input and subsequent output on prior output: as the model generates substantial benign content, its attention weights shift from the input to prior output, making it more susceptible to jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate the exploitability of DTD, we propose a novel jailbreak attack method, Sugar-Coated Poison (SCP), which induces the model to generate substantial benign content through benign input and adversarial reasoning, subsequently producing malicious content. To mitigate such attacks, we introduce a simple yet effective defense strategy, POSD, which significantly reduces jailbreak success rates while preserving the model's generalization capabilities.

# ShadowCoT: Cognitive Hijacking for Stealthy Reasoning Backdoors in LLMs 

**Authors**: Gejian Zhao, Hanzhou Wu, Xinpeng Zhang, Athanasios V. Vasilakos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05605)  

**Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) enhances an LLM's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, but it also introduces new security issues. In this work, we present ShadowCoT, a novel backdoor attack framework that targets the internal reasoning mechanism of LLMs. Unlike prior token-level or prompt-based attacks, ShadowCoT directly manipulates the model's cognitive reasoning path, enabling it to hijack multi-step reasoning chains and produce logically coherent but adversarial outcomes. By conditioning on internal reasoning states, ShadowCoT learns to recognize and selectively disrupt key reasoning steps, effectively mounting a self-reflective cognitive attack within the target model. Our approach introduces a lightweight yet effective multi-stage injection pipeline, which selectively rewires attention pathways and perturbs intermediate representations with minimal parameter overhead (only 0.15% updated). ShadowCoT further leverages reinforcement learning and reasoning chain pollution (RCP) to autonomously synthesize stealthy adversarial CoTs that remain undetectable to advanced defenses. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks and LLMs show that ShadowCoT consistently achieves high Attack Success Rate (94.4%) and Hijacking Success Rate (88.4%) while preserving benign performance. These results reveal an emergent class of cognition-level threats and highlight the urgent need for defenses beyond shallow surface-level consistency.

# Skywork R1V: Pioneering Multimodal Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought 

**Authors**: Yi Peng, Chris, Xiaokun Wang, Yichen Wei, Jiangbo Pei, Weijie Qiu, Ai Jian, Yunzhuo Hao, Jiachun Pan, Tianyidan Xie, Li Ge, Rongxian Zhuang, Xuchen Song, Yang Liu, Yahui Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05599)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model extending the an R1-series Large language models (LLM) to visual modalities via an efficient multimodal transfer method. Leveraging a lightweight visual projector, Skywork R1V facilitates seamless multimodal adaptation without necessitating retraining of either the foundational language model or the vision encoder. To strengthen visual-text alignment, we propose a hybrid optimization strategy that combines Iterative Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), significantly enhancing cross-modal integration efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive-length Chain-of-Thought distillation approach for reasoning data generation. This approach dynamically optimizes reasoning chain lengths, thereby enhancing inference efficiency and preventing excessive reasoning overthinking. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Skywork R1V, with only 38B parameters, delivers competitive performance, achieving a score of 69.0 on the MMMU benchmark and 67.5 on MathVista. Meanwhile, it maintains robust textual reasoning performance, evidenced by impressive scores of 72.0 on AIME and 94.0 on MATH500. The Skywork R1V model weights have been publicly released to promote openness and reproducibility.

# Efficient Reinforcement Finetuning via Adaptive Curriculum Learning 

**Authors**: Taiwei Shi, Yiyang Wu, Linxin Song, Tianyi Zhou, Jieyu Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05520)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has shown great potential for enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it is often sample- and compute-inefficient, requiring extensive training. In this work, we introduce AdaRFT (Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Finetuning), a method that significantly improves both the efficiency and final accuracy of RFT through adaptive curriculum learning. AdaRFT dynamically adjusts the difficulty of training problems based on the model's recent reward signals, ensuring that the model consistently trains on tasks that are challenging but solvable. This adaptive sampling strategy accelerates learning by maintaining an optimal difficulty range, avoiding wasted computation on problems that are too easy or too hard. AdaRFT requires only a lightweight extension to standard RFT algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), without modifying the reward function or model architecture. Experiments on competition-level math datasets-including AMC, AIME, and IMO-style problems-demonstrate that AdaRFT significantly improves both training efficiency and reasoning performance. We evaluate AdaRFT across multiple data distributions and model sizes, showing that it reduces the number of training steps by up to 2x and improves accuracy by a considerable margin, offering a more scalable and effective RFT framework.

# Evaluating the Generalization Capabilities of Large Language Models on Code Reasoning 

**Authors**: Rem Yang, Julian Dai, Nikos Vasilakis, Martin Rinard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05518)  

**Abstract**: We assess how the code reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) generalize to different kinds of programs. We present techniques for obtaining in- and out-of-distribution programs with different characteristics: code sampled from a domain-specific language, code automatically generated by an LLM, code collected from competitive programming contests, and mutated versions of these programs. We also present an experimental methodology for evaluating LLM generalization by comparing their performance on these programs. We perform an extensive evaluation across 10 state-of-the-art models from the past year, obtaining insights into their generalization capabilities over time and across different classes of programs. Our results highlight that while earlier models exhibit behavior consistent with pattern matching, the latest models exhibit strong generalization abilities on code reasoning.

# GraphRAFT: Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning for Knowledge Graphs on Graph Databases 

**Authors**: Alfred Clemedtson, Borun Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05478)  

**Abstract**: Large language models have shown remarkable language processing and reasoning ability but are prone to hallucinate when asked about private data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q\&As on large text-attributed KGs.

# Reasoning Models Know When They're Right: Probing Hidden States for Self-Verification 

**Authors**: Anqi Zhang, Yulin Chen, Jane Pan, Chen Zhao, Aurojit Panda, Jinyang Li, He He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05419)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance on tasks like math and logical reasoning thanks to their ability to search during reasoning. However, they still suffer from overthinking, often performing unnecessary reasoning steps even after reaching the correct answer. This raises the question: can models evaluate the correctness of their intermediate answers during reasoning? In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency.

# Thanos: A Block-wise Pruning Algorithm for Efficient Large Language Model Compression 

**Authors**: Ivan Ilin, Peter Richtarik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05346)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents Thanos, a novel weight-pruning algorithm designed to reduce the memory footprint and enhance the computational efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by removing redundant weights while maintaining accuracy. Thanos introduces a block-wise pruning strategy with adaptive masks that dynamically adjust to weight importance, enabling flexible sparsity patterns and structured formats, such as $n:m$ sparsity, optimized for hardware acceleration. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that Thanos achieves state-of-the-art performance in structured pruning and outperforms existing methods in unstructured pruning. By providing an efficient and adaptable approach to model compression, Thanos offers a practical solution for deploying large models in resource-constrained environments.

# Hybrid Retrieval for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis 

**Authors**: Chandana Sree Mala, Gizem Gezici, Fosca Giannotti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05324)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language comprehension and generation but are prone to hallucinations, producing factually incorrect or unsupported outputs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by grounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword search, dense retrieval using semantic search with Sentence Transformers, and a proposed hybrid retrieval module. The hybrid module incorporates query expansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a dynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score. Using the HaluBench dataset, a benchmark for hallucinations in question answering tasks, we assess retrieval performance with metrics such as mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain, focusing on the relevance of the top three retrieved documents. Results show that the hybrid retriever achieves better relevance scores, outperforming both sparse and dense retrievers. Further evaluation of LLM-generated answers against ground truth using metrics such as accuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection rate reveals that the hybrid retriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the lowest hallucination rate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the hybrid retriever's ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates, and improve LLM reliability, emphasising the importance of advanced retrieval techniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy.

# Multi-Perspective Attention Mechanism for Bias-Aware Sequential Recommendation 

**Authors**: Mingjian Fu, Hengsheng Chen, Dongchun Jiang, Yanchao Tan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05323)  

**Abstract**: In the era of advancing information technology, recommender systems have emerged as crucial tools for dealing with information overload. However, traditional recommender systems still have limitations in capturing the dynamic evolution of user behavior. To better understand and predict user behavior, especially taking into account the complexity of temporal evolution, sequential recommender systems have gradually become the focus of research. Currently, many sequential recommendation algorithms ignore the amplification effects of prevalent biases, which leads to recommendation results being susceptible to the Matthew Effect. Additionally, it will impose limitations on the recommender system's ability to deeply perceive and capture the dynamic shifts in user preferences, thereby diminishing the extent of its recommendation reach. To address this issue effectively, we propose a recommendation system based on sequential information and attention mechanism called Multi-Perspective Attention Bias Sequential Recommendation (MABSRec). Firstly, we reconstruct user sequences into three short types and utilize graph neural networks for item weighting. Subsequently, an adaptive multi-bias perspective attention module is proposed to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. Experimental results show that the MABSRec model exhibits significant advantages in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its excellent performance in the sequence recommendation task.

# On Synthesizing Data for Context Attribution in Question Answering 

**Authors**: Gorjan Radevski, Kiril Gashteovski, Shahbaz Syed, Christopher Malon, Sebastien Nicolas, Chia-Chien Hung, Timo Sztyler, Verena Heußer, Wiem Ben Rim, Masafumi Enomoto, Kunihiro Takeoka, Masafumi Oyamada, Goran Glavaš, Carolin Lawrence  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05317)  

**Abstract**: Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage "in the wild". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as "hallucinations". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.

# Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation 

**Authors**: Jianyang Zhai, Zi-Feng Mai, Chang-Dong Wang, Feidiao Yang, Xiawu Zheng, Hui Li, Yonghong Tian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05314)  

**Abstract**: Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm aiming at directly generating the identifiers of the target candidates. Most existing methods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often fail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of PLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely consider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of items, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate efficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our key idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a unified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert the text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise language, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same vocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks to enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge. Finally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different domains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and fine-tuning. We evaluate the effectiveness of MQL4GRec through extensive experiments and comparisons with existing methods, achieving improvements over the baseline by 11.18\%, 14.82\%, and 7.95\% on the NDCG metric across three different datasets, respectively.
