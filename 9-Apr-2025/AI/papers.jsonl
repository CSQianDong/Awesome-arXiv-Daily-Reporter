We introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\\circledR$, an FEA software, to compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped with the ability to interact with the software through its Application Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex problems in the real world.

To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources, enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases, and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on 64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50 (superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks, such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language, provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last Exam benchmark (Chemistry & Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over o3-mini (high)."}

SHIMI organizes memory into layered semantic nodes and supports top-down traversal from abstract intent to specific entities, offering more precise and explainable retrieval. Critically, SHIMI is natively designed for decentralized ecosystems, where agents maintain local memory trees and synchronize them asynchronously across networks. We introduce a lightweight sync protocol that leverages Merkle-DAG summaries, Bloom filters, and CRDT-style conflict resolution to enable partial synchronization with minimal overhead.

However, existing reward models lack this ability, as they are typically trained by increasing the reward gap between chosen and rejected responses, while overlooking the prompts that the responses are conditioned on. Consequently, when the trained reward model is evaluated on prompt-response pairs that lie outside the data distribution, neglecting the effect of prompts may result in poor generalization of the reward model. To address this issue, we decompose the reward value into two independent components: prompt-free reward and prompt-related reward. Prompt-free reward represents the evaluation that is determined only by responses, while the prompt-related reward reflects the reward that derives from both the prompt and the response. We extract these two components from an information-theoretic perspective, which requires no extra models. Subsequently, we propose a new reward learning algorithm by prioritizing data samples based on their prompt-free reward values. Through toy examples, we demonstrate that the extracted prompt-free and prompt-related rewards effectively characterize two parts of the reward model. Further, standard evaluations show that our method improves both the alignment performance and the generalization capability of the reward model.'}

Traditional large language model (LLM) watermarking techniques, which rely on token-level manipulations, are ill-suited for agents due to the challenges of behavior tokenization and information loss during behavior-to-action translation. To address these issues, we propose Agent Guide, a novel behavioral watermarking framework that embeds watermarks by guiding the agent's high-level decisions (behavior) through probability biases, while preserving the naturalness of specific executions (action). Our approach decouples agent behavior into two levels, behavior (e.g., choosing to bookmark) and action (e.g., bookmarking with specific tags), and applies watermark-guided biases to the behavior probability distribution. We employ a z-statistic-based statistical analysis to detect the watermark, ensuring reliable extraction over multiple rounds. Experiments in a social media scenario with diverse agent profiles demonstrate that Agent Guide achieves effective watermark detection with a low false positive rate. Our framework provides a practical and robust solution for agent watermarking, with applications in identifying malicious agents and protecting proprietary agent systems."}

But how do these agents perform in complex high-stakes domains, where domain expertise is essential and mistakes carry substantial risk? This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLM-advisors in the finance domain, focusing on three distinct challenges: (1) eliciting user preferences when users themselves may be unsure of their needs, (2) providing personalized guidance for diverse investment preferences, and (3) leveraging advisor personality to build relationships and foster trust. Via a lab-based user study with 64 participants, we show that LLM-advisors often match human advisor performance when eliciting preferences, although they can struggle to resolve conflicting user needs. When providing personalized advice, the LLM was able to positively influence user behavior, but demonstrated clear failure modes. Our results show that accurate preference elicitation is key, otherwise, the LLM-advisor has little impact, or can even direct the investor toward unsuitable assets. More worryingly, users appear insensitive to the quality of advice being given, or worse these can have an inverse relationship. Indeed, users reported a preference for and increased satisfaction as well as emotional trust with LLMs adopting an extroverted persona, even though those agents provided worse advice.'}

This advantage is in part due to the brain cross-regional temporal development mechanisms, where the progressive formation, reorganization, and pruning of connections from basic to advanced regions, facilitate knowledge transfer and prevent network redundancy. Inspired by these, we propose the Continual Learning of Multiple Cognitive Functions with Brain-inspired Temporal Development Mechanism(TD-MCL), enabling cognitive enhancement from simple to complex in Perception-Motor-Interaction(PMI) multiple cognitive task scenarios. The TD-MCL model proposes the sequential evolution of long-range connections between different cognitive modules to promote positive knowledge transfer, while using feedback-guided local connection inhibition and pruning to effectively eliminate redundancies in previous tasks, reducing energy consumption while preserving acquired knowledge. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve continual learning capabilities while reducing network scale, without introducing regularization, replay, or freezing strategies, and achieving superior accuracy on new tasks compared to direct learning. The proposed method shows that the brain's developmental mechanisms offer a valuable reference for exploring biologically plausible, low-energy enhancements of general cognitive abilities."}

In this work, we study whether reasoning models encode information about answer correctness through probing the model's hidden states. The resulting probe can verify intermediate answers with high accuracy and produces highly calibrated scores. Additionally, we find models' hidden states encode correctness of future answers, enabling early prediction of the correctness before the intermediate answer is fully formulated. We then use the probe as a verifier to decide whether to exit reasoning at intermediate answers during inference, reducing the number of inference tokens by 24\\% without compromising performance. These findings confirm that reasoning models do encode a notion of correctness yet fail to exploit it, revealing substantial untapped potential to enhance their efficiency."}

Applied to Buchwald-Hartwig reaction optimization, our method nearly doubles the discovery rate of high-performing reactions compared to static LLM embeddings (from 24% to 43% coverage of the top 5% reactions in just 50 optimization iterations). We also observe a 14% improvement over domain-specific representations without requiring specialized features.

Yet there is a lack of surveys and comparative evaluations that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we provide an overview of the state of the art in this continuously evolving field. The survey sheds light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifiers selection through meta-learning. In this regard, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is usually treated as an ASP problem under the umbrella of the democratization of machine learning. Accordingly, AutoML makes machine learning techniques accessible to domain scientists who are interested in applying advanced analytics but lack the required expertise. It can ease the task of manually selecting ML algorithms and tuning related hyperparameters. We comprehensively discuss the different phases of classifiers selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we propose a benchmark knowledge base of 4 millions previously learned models and present extensive comparative evaluations of the prominent methods for classifiers selection based on 08 classification algorithms and 400 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of algorithms selection methods along while emphasizing the strengths and limitations of existing studies.'}

Distilling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) teachers into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) students has emerged as an effective approach to achieve strong performance and reducing computational cost by removing graph dependency. However, existing distillation methods only use standard GNNs and overlook alternative teachers such as specialized model for link prediction (GNN4LP) and heuristic methods (e.g., common neighbors). This paper first explores the impact of different teachers in GNN-to-MLP distillation. Surprisingly, we find that stronger teachers do not always produce stronger students: MLPs distilled from GNN4LP can underperform those distilled from simpler GNNs, while weaker heuristic methods can teach MLPs to near-GNN performance with drastically reduced training costs. Building on these insights, we propose Ensemble Heuristic-Distilled MLPs (EHDM), which eliminates graph dependencies while effectively integrating complementary signals via a gating mechanism. Experiments on ten datasets show an average 7.93% improvement over previous GNN-to-MLP approaches with 1.95-3.32 times less training time, indicating EHDM is an efficient and effective link prediction method.'}

To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validationto minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates, and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the best models based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best.

We present a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction, and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%, identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90 and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic object profiles and satellite glinting.

In particular, these techniques adopt large antenna arrays and formulate narrow beams to obtain satisfactory received powers. However, performing accurate beam alignment over narrow beams for efficient link configuration by traditional standard defined beam selection approaches, which mainly rely on channel state information and beam sweeping through exhaustive searching, imposes computational and communications overheads. And, such resulting overheads limit their potential use in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications involving highly dynamic scenarios. In comparison, utilizing out-of-band contextual information, such as sensing data obtained from sensor devices, provides a better alternative to reduce overheads. This paper presents a deep learning-based solution for utilizing the multi-modality sensing data for predicting the optimal beams having sufficient mmWave received powers so that the best V2I and V2V line-of-sight links can be ensured proactively. The proposed solution has been tested on real-world measured mmWave sensing and communication data, and the results show that it can achieve up to 98.19% accuracies while predicting top-13 beams. Correspondingly, when compared to existing been sweeping approach, the beam sweeping searching space and time overheads are greatly shortened roughly by 79.67% and 91.89%, respectively which confirm a promising solution for beamforming in mmWave enabled communications.'}

This creates a range of challenges, including selecting an appropriate architecture for a system and assessing different architectural alternatives. Relying on human expertise to accomplish the task of mapping NL requirements to architecture is time-consuming and error-prone. This paper proposes ARLO, an approach that automates this task by leveraging (1) a set of NL requirements for a system, (2) an existing standard that specifies architecturally relevant software quality attributes, and (3) a readily available Large Language Model (LLM). Specifically, ARLO determines the subset of NL requirements for a given system that is architecturally relevant and maps that subset to a tailorable matrix of architectural choices. ARLO applies integer linear programming on the architectural-choice matrix to determine the optimal architecture for the current requirements. We demonstrate ARLO's efficacy using a set of real-world examples. We highlight ARLO's ability (1) to trace the selected architectural choices to the requirements and (2) to isolate NL requirements that exert a particular influence on a system's architecture. This allows the identification, comparative assessment, and exploration of alternative architectural choices based on the requirements and constraints expressed therein."}

This paper addresses these limitations by focusing on the development of high-performance virtual sensors to enhance vehicle state estimation for active safety. The proposed Uncertainty-Aware Hybrid Learning (UAHL) architecture integrates a machine learning model with vehicle motion models to estimate VSA directly from onboard sensor data. A key aspect of the UAHL architecture is its focus on uncertainty quantification for individual model estimates and hybrid fusion. These mechanisms enable the dynamic weighting of uncertainty-aware predictions from machine learning and vehicle motion models to produce accurate and reliable hybrid VSA estimates. This work also presents a novel dataset named Real-world Vehicle State Estimation Dataset (ReV-StED), comprising synchronized measurements from advanced vehicle dynamic sensors.

However, manually selecting standard frames is time-consuming and prone to intra- and inter-sonographer variability. Existing methods primarily rely on image-based approaches that capture standard frames and then classify the input frames across different anatomies. This ignores the dynamic nature of video acquisition and its interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Tier Class-Aware Token Transformer (MCAT), a visual query-based video clip localization (VQ-VCL) method, to assist sonographers by enabling them to capture a quick US sweep. By then providing a visual query of the anatomy they wish to analyze, MCAT returns the video clip containing the standard frames for that anatomy, facilitating thorough screening for potential anomalies. We evaluate MCAT on two ultrasound video datasets and a natural image VQ-VCL dataset based on Ego4D. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% and 13% mIoU on the ultrasound datasets and by 5.35% mIoU on the Ego4D dataset, using 96% fewer tokens. MCAT's efficiency and accuracy have significant potential implications for public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it may enhance prenatal care by streamlining standard plane acquisition, simplifying US-based screening, diagnosis and allowing sonographers to examine more patients."}

Unlike conventional stochastic generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner.

By leveraging these data for training machine learning models,researchers have devised novel data-driven methodologies that address the personalized route recommendation (PRR) problem. In contrast to conventional algorithms such as Dijkstra shortest path algorithm,these novel algorithms possess the capacity to discern and learn patterns within the data,thereby facilitating the generation of more personalized paths. However,once these models have been trained,their application is constrained to the generation of routes that align with their training patterns. This limitation renders them less adaptable to novel scenarios and the deployment of multiple machine learning models might be necessary to address new possible scenarios,which can be costly as each model must be trained separately. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs),we leveraged their natural language understanding capabilities to develop a unified model to solve the PRR problem while being seamlessly adaptable to new scenarios without additional training. To accomplish this,we combined the extensive knowledge LLMs acquired during training with further access to external hand-crafted context information,similar to RAG (Retrieved Augmented Generation) systems,to enhance their ability to generate paths according to user-defined requirements.

The proposal comprises an episodic memory buffer containing a prioritised memory module to ensure important rare trajectories are kept longer to address the Zipfian problem, which needs credit assignment to happen in a sample efficient manner. The experiences are then reinstated from episodic memory and given weighted importance forming the trajectory to be executed. Notably, the proposed architecture is modular, can be incorporated in any RL architecture and yields improved performance in multiple Zipfian tasks over traditional architectures.

In this work, we rethink human activity recognition by combining the RGB and event cameras. The first contribution is the proposed large-scale multi-modal RGB-Event human activity recognition benchmark dataset, termed HARDVS 2.0, which bridges the dataset gaps.

However, recent studies have shown that diffusion models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, allowing attackers to enter input data containing triggers to activate the backdoor and generate their desired output. Existing backdoor attack methods primarily focused on target noise-to-image and text-to-image tasks, with limited work on backdoor attacks in image-to-image tasks. Furthermore, traditional backdoor attacks often rely on a single, conspicuous trigger to generate a fixed target image, lacking concealability and flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel backdoor attack method called "Parasite" for image-to-image tasks in diffusion models, which not only is the first to leverage steganography for triggers hiding, but also allows attackers to embed the target content as a backdoor trigger to achieve a more flexible attack. "Parasite" as a novel attack method effectively bypasses existing detection frameworks to execute backdoor attacks. In our experiments, "Parasite" achieved a 0 percent backdoor detection rate against the mainstream defense frameworks.

However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target domains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution shifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention mechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to key objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture, scale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain adaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with dynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in transferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic segmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial transferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive Cluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images into structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized transferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA) module that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs' attention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low transferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across 20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2% MIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

We first validate Nes2Net on CtrSVDD, a singing voice deepfake detection dataset, and report a 22% performance improvement and an 87% back-end computational cost reduction over the state-of-the-art baseline. Additionally, extensive testing across four diverse datasets: ASVspoof 2021, ASVspoof 5, PartialSpoof, and In-the-Wild, covering fully spoofed speech, adversarial attacks, partial spoofing, and real-world scenarios, consistently highlights Nes2Net's superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

This paper introduces Lattice, a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank structure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number of memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this compression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory update rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence features a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an interpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal update: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to its current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which minimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental results show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all baselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming more pronounced as the context length increases.'}

However, the impact of reasoning on a model's ability to mitigate stereotypical responses remains largely underexplored. In this work, we investigate the crucial relationship between a model's reasoning ability and fairness, and ask whether improved reasoning capabilities can mitigate harmful stereotypical responses, especially those arising due to shallow or flawed reasoning. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multiple open-source LLMs, and find that larger models with stronger reasoning abilities exhibit substantially lower stereotypical bias on existing fairness benchmarks. Building on this insight, we introduce ReGiFT -- Reasoning Guided Fine-Tuning, a novel approach that extracts structured reasoning traces from advanced reasoning models and infuses them into models that lack such capabilities. We use only general-purpose reasoning and do not require any fairness-specific supervision for bias mitigation. Notably, we see that models fine-tuned using ReGiFT not only improve fairness relative to their non-reasoning counterparts but also outperform advanced reasoning models on fairness benchmarks. We also analyze how variations in the correctness of the reasoning traces and their length influence model fairness and their overall performance. Our findings highlight that enhancing reasoning capabilities is an effective, fairness-agnostic strategy for mitigating stereotypical bias caused by reasoning flaws."}

However, DP-SGD, which directly perturbs gradients in the training iterations, fails to mitigate the negative impacts of noise on gradient direction. As a result, DP-SGD is often inefficient. Although various solutions (e.g., clipping to reduce the sensitivity of gradients and amplifying privacy bounds to save privacy budgets) are proposed to trade privacy for model efficiency, the root cause of its inefficiency is yet unveiled.\nIn this work, we first generalize DP-SGD and theoretically derive the impact of DP noise on the training process. Our analysis reveals that, in terms of a perturbed gradient, only the noise on direction has eminent impact on the model efficiency while that on magnitude can be mitigated by optimization techniques, i.e., fine-tuning gradient clipping and learning rate. Besides, we confirm that traditional DP introduces biased noise on the direction when adding unbiased noise to the gradient itself. Overall, the perturbation of DP-SGD is actually sub-optimal from a geometric perspective. Motivated by this, we design a geometric perturbation strategy GeoDP within the DP framework, which perturbs the direction and the magnitude of a gradient, respectively. By directly reducing the noise on the direction, GeoDP mitigates the negative impact of DP noise on model efficiency with the same DP guarantee. Extensive experiments on two public datasets (i.e., MNIST and CIFAR-10), one synthetic dataset and three prevalent models (i.e., Logistic Regression, CNN and ResNet) confirm the effectiveness and generality of our strategy.'}

It enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, handling noisy labels in FL remains a major challenge due to heterogeneous data distributions and communication constraints, which can severely degrade model performance. To address this issue, we propose FedEFC, a novel method designed to tackle the impact of noisy labels in FL. FedEFC mitigates this issue through two key techniques: (1) prestopping, which prevents overfitting to mislabeled data by dynamically halting training at an optimal point, and (2) loss correction, which adjusts model updates to account for label noise. In particular, we develop an effective loss correction tailored to the unique challenges of FL, including data heterogeneity and decentralized training. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis, leveraging the composite proper loss property, to demonstrate that the FL objective function under noisy label distributions can be aligned with the clean label distribution. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it consistently outperforms existing FL techniques in mitigating the impact of noisy labels, particularly under heterogeneous data settings (e.g., achieving up to 41.64% relative performance improvement over the existing loss correction method).'}

Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) for reading comprehension, this issue remains critical, particularly as the length of supported contexts continues to expand. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative data augmentation methodology grounded in a multi-agent collaborative framework. Unlike traditional methods, such as the costly human annotation process required for datasets like SQuAD 2.0, our method autonomously generates evidence-based question-answer pairs and systematically constructs unanswerable questions. Using this methodology, we developed the FactGuard-Bench dataset, which comprises 25,220 examples of both answerable and unanswerable question scenarios, with context lengths ranging from 8K to 128K. Experimental evaluations conducted on seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models achieve only 61.79% overall accuracy. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of a model's ability to reason about unanswerable questions to avoid generating plausible but incorrect answers. By implementing efficient data selection and generation within the multi-agent collaborative framework, our method significantly reduces the traditionally high costs associated with manual annotation and provides valuable insights for the training and optimization of LLMs."}

To potentially aid their efforts, multiple lesion detection algorithms have been developed with a large public dataset called DeepLesion (32,735 lesions, 32,120 CT slices, 10,594 studies, 4,427 patients, 8 body part labels). However, this dataset contains missing measurements and lesion tags, and exhibits a severe imbalance in the number of lesions per label category. In this work, we utilize a limited subset of DeepLesion (6\\%, 1331 lesions, 1309 slices) containing lesion annotations and body part label tags to train a VFNet model to detect lesions and tag them. We address the class imbalance by conducting three experiments: 1) Balancing data by the body part labels, 2) Balancing data by the number of lesions per patient, and 3) Balancing data by the lesion size. In contrast to a randomly sampled (unbalanced) data subset, our results indicated that balancing the body part labels always increased sensitivity for lesions >= 1cm for classes with low data quantities (Bone: 80\\% vs. 46\\%, Kidney: 77\\% vs. 61\\%, Soft Tissue: 70\\% vs. 60\\%, Pelvis: 83\\% vs. 76\\%). Similar trends were seen for three other models tested (FasterRCNN, RetinaNet, FoveaBox). Balancing data by lesion size also helped the VFNet model improve recalls for all classes in contrast to an unbalanced dataset. We also provide a structured reporting guideline for a ``Lesions'' subsection to be entered into the ``Findings'' section of a radiology report. To our knowledge, we are the first to report the class imbalance in DeepLesion, and have taken data-driven steps to address it in the context of joint lesion detection and tagging."}

However, a fast and accurate learning-based model by offline training makes it very hard to get accurate pointwise dynamics when the dynamics are chaotic. To bridge this gap, the current work proposes a multi-fidelity reinforcement learning (MFRL) framework that leverages differentiable hybrid models for control tasks, where a physics-based hybrid model is corrected by limited high-fidelity data. We also proposed a spectrum-based reward function for RL learning. The effect of the proposed framework is demonstrated on two complex dynamics in physics.

In this work, we aim to address three questions: (1) What is the best recipe to identify the least knowledgeable subset of experts that can be dropped with minimal impact on performance? (2) How should we perform expert dropping (one-shot or iterative), and what correction measures can we undertake to minimize its drastic impact on SMoE subnetwork capabilities? (3) What capabilities of full-SMoEs are severely impacted by the removal of the least dominant experts, and how can we recover them? Firstly, we propose MoE Experts Compression Suite (MC-Suite), which is a collection of some previously explored and multiple novel recipes to provide a comprehensive benchmark for estimating expert importance from diverse perspectives, as well as unveil numerous valuable insights for SMoE experts. Secondly, unlike prior works with a one-shot expert pruning approach, we explore the benefits of iterative pruning with the re-estimation of the MC-Suite criterion. Moreover, we introduce the benefits of task-agnostic fine-tuning as a correction mechanism during iterative expert dropping, which we term MoE Lottery Subnetworks.

By incorporating temporal information, TW-CRL learns a dense reward function that identifies critical states associated with success or failure.

First, we use the database to compute a heuristic for determining which nodes of a search tree to expand, in contrast to prior work which generally pastes the (possibly transformed) queried path or uses it to bias a sampling distribution. We demonstrate that this makes our method more easily composable with other search methods by dynamically interleaving exploration according to a baseline algorithm with exploitation of the database guidance.

The difficulty arises from several factors. First, the sheer number of potential outcomes stemming from even a single position, starting from the initial setup, makes forecasting a player's next move incredibly complex. Second, and perhaps even more challenging, is the inherent unpredictability of human behavior. Unlike the optimized play of engines, humans introduce a layer of variability due to differing playing styles and decision-making processes. Each player approaches the game with a unique blend of strategic thinking, tactical awareness, and psychological tendencies, leading to diverse and often unexpected actions. This stylistic variation, combined with the capacity for creativity and even irrational moves, makes predicting human play difficult. Chess, a longstanding benchmark of artificial intelligence research, has seen significant advancements in tools and automation. Engines like Deep Blue, AlphaZero, and Stockfish can defeat even the most skilled human players. However, despite their exceptional ability to outplay top-level grandmasters, predicting the moves of non-grandmaster players, who comprise most of the global chess community -- remains complicated for these engines.

While prior research has extensively analyzed summarization models, little attention has been given to the role of document characteristics in influencing summarization performance. In this work, we explore two key research questions. First, do documents exhibit consistent summarization quality across multiple systems? If so, can we predict a document's summarization performance without generating a summary? We answer both questions affirmatively and introduce PreSumm, a novel task in which a system predicts summarization performance based solely on the source document. Our analysis sheds light on common properties of documents with low PreSumm scores, revealing that they often suffer from coherence issues, complex content, or a lack of a clear main theme. In addition, we demonstrate PreSumm's practical utility in two key applications: improving hybrid summarization workflows by identifying documents that require manual summarization and enhancing dataset quality by filtering outliers and noisy documents. Overall, our findings highlight the critical role of document properties in summarization performance and offer insights into the limitations of current systems that could serve as the basis for future improvements."}

MacIver, Li Du, Jason Eisner, Ryan Cotterell, Vikash Mansinghka, Timothy J. O'Donnell, Alexander K. Lew, Tim Vieira", 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05410', 'abstract': "The dominant approach to generating from language models subject to some constraint is locally constrained decoding (LCD), incrementally sampling tokens at each time step such that the constraint is never violated. Typically, this is achieved through token masking: looping over the vocabulary and excluding non-conforming tokens. There are two important problems with this approach. (i) Evaluating the constraint on every token can be prohibitively expensive -- LM vocabularies often exceed $100,000$ tokens. (ii) LCD can distort the global distribution over strings, sampling tokens based only on local information, even if they lead down dead-end paths. This work introduces a new algorithm that addresses both these problems. First, to avoid evaluating a constraint on the full vocabulary at each step of generation, we propose an adaptive rejection sampling algorithm that typically requires orders of magnitude fewer constraint evaluations. Second, we show how this algorithm can be extended to produce low-variance, unbiased estimates of importance weights at a very small additional cost -- estimates that can be soundly used within previously proposed sequential Monte Carlo algorithms to correct for the myopic behavior of local constraint enforcement. Through extensive empirical evaluation in text-to-SQL, molecular synthesis, goal inference, pattern matching, and JSON domains, we show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines, supporting a broader class of constraints and improving both runtime and performance. Additional theoretical and empirical analyses show that our method's runtime efficiency is driven by its dynamic use of computation, scaling with the divergence between the unconstrained and constrained LM, and as a consequence, runtime improvements are greater for better models."}

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on cybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and mitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of frontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and future impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and quantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more than defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and economic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software system development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing new risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations, including constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing AI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for hybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and strengthening defenses for users. Finally, we present long-term research questions essential for understanding AI's future impacts and unleashing its defensive capabilities."}

Departing from a long history of prior work, we consider the weakest possible form of function approximation, called agnostic policy learning, where the learner seeks to find the best policy in a given class $\\Pi$, with no guarantee that $\\Pi$ contains an optimal policy for the underlying task. Although it is known that sample-efficient agnostic policy learning is not possible in the standard online RL setting without further assumptions, we investigate the extent to which this can be overcome with stronger forms of access to the environment. Specifically, we show that: 1. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given access to a local simulator, from which one can reset to any previously seen state. This result holds even when the policy class is realizable, and stands in contrast to a positive result of [MFR24] showing that value-based learning under realizability is tractable with local simulator access. 2. Agnostic policy learning remains statistically intractable when given online access to a reset distribution with good coverage properties over the state space (the so-called $\\mu$-reset setting). We also study stronger forms of function approximation for policy learning, showing that PSDP [BKSN03] and CPI [KL02] provably fail in the absence of policy completeness. 3. On a positive note, agnostic policy learning is statistically tractable for Block MDPs with access to both of the above reset models. We establish this via a new algorithm that carefully constructs a policy emulator: a tabular MDP with a small state space that approximates the value functions of all policies $\\pi \\in \\Pi$. These values are approximated without any explicit value function class.'}

To bridge this gap, we propose GARF, a generalizable 3D reassembly framework for real-world fractures. GARF leverages fracture-aware pretraining to learn fracture features from individual fragments, with flow matching enabling precise 6-DoF alignments. At inference time, we introduce one-step preassembly, improving robustness to unseen objects and varying numbers of fractures. In collaboration with archaeologists, paleoanthropologists, and ornithologists, we curate Fractura, a diverse dataset for vision and learning communities, featuring real-world fracture types across ceramics, bones, eggshells, and lithics.

In this paper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to serve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or classifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the natural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human colony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system uniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI agents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These learners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as a single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the diversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms and their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed, and organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique one-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI agents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and inter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights and biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI agents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that consists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve diversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates child-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and 95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a task.'}

In this paper, we present a unified framework based on kernel methods to analyze both families of efficient PEs. We use this framework to develop a novel PE method called RoPEPool, capable of extracting causal relationships from temporal sequences. Using RFF-based PEs and rotation-based PEs, we demonstrate how seemingly disparate PEs can be jointly studied by considering the content-context interactions they induce. For empirical validation, we use a symbolic music generation task, namely, melody harmonization. We show that RoPEPool, combined with highly-informative structural priors, outperforms all methods.'}

The common approach to finding a winning ticket is to preserve the original strong generalization through Iterative Pruning (IP) and transfer information useful for achieving the learned generalization by applying the resulting sparse mask to an untrained network. However, existing IP methods still struggle to generalize their observations beyond ad-hoc initialization and small-scale architectures or datasets, or they bypass these challenges by applying their mask to trained weights instead of initialized ones. In this paper, we demonstrate that the parameter sign configuration plays a crucial role in conveying useful information for generalization to any randomly initialized network. Through linear mode connectivity analysis, we observe that a sparse network trained by an existing IP method can retain its basin of attraction if its parameter signs and normalization layer parameters are preserved. To take a step closer to finding a winning ticket, we alleviate the reliance on normalization layer parameters by preventing high error barriers along the linear path between the sparse network trained by our method and its counterpart with initialized normalization layer parameters. Interestingly, across various architectures and datasets, we observe that any randomly initialized network can be optimized to exhibit low error barriers along the linear path to the sparse network trained by our method by inheriting its sparsity and parameter sign information, potentially achieving performance comparable to the original.

Transformer-based architectures have demonstrated significant promise in capturing complex spatio-temporality dependencies. However, their reliance on normalization layers can lead to computation overhead and training instabilities. In this work, we present a two-fold approach to address these challenges. First, we integrate DynamicTanh (DyT), which is the latest method to promote transformers, into the backbone, replacing traditional layer normalization. This modification simplifies the network architecture and improves the stability of the inference. We are the first work to deploy the DyT to the trajectory prediction task. Complementing this, we employ a snapshot ensemble strategy to further boost trajectory prediction performance. Using cyclical learning rate scheduling, multiple model snapshots are captured during a single training run. These snapshots are then aggregated via simple averaging at inference time, allowing the model to benefit from diverse hypotheses without incurring substantial additional computational cost. Extensive experiments on Argoverse datasets demonstrate that our combined approach significantly improves prediction accuracy, inference speed and robustness in diverse driving scenarios.

Our analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based approaches significantly outperform standard linear models in forecasting accuracy. Moreover, by employing explainable machine learning techniques, we reveal that the Phillips curve relationship in India is highly nonlinear, characterized by thresholds and interaction effects among key variables.

The strategy of adopting distinct approaches to learn from homophilic and heterophilic components in node-level tasks has been widely discussed and proven effective both theoretically and experimentally. However, in graph-level tasks, research on this topic remains notably scarce. Addressing this gap, our research conducts an analysis on graphs with nodes' category ID available, distinguishing intra-category and inter-category components as embodiment of homophily and heterophily, respectively. We find while GCNs excel at extracting information within categories, they frequently capture noise from inter-category components. Consequently, it is crucial to employ distinct learning strategies for intra- and inter-category elements. To alleviate this problem, we separately learn the intra- and inter-category parts by a combination of an intra-category convolution (IntraNet) and an inter-category high-pass graph convolution (InterNet). Our IntraNet is supported by sophisticated graph preprocessing steps and a novel category-based graph readout function. For the InterNet, we utilize a high-pass filter to amplify the node disparities, enhancing the recognition of details in the high-frequency components.

To do so, we use a constraint-based generator that systematically traverses and generates levels in this space. To train the constraint-based generator we use different tile patterns to learn from the initial example levels. We analyze how different patterns influence the exploration of the expressive range. Specifically, we compare the exploration process based on time, the number of successful and failed sample generations, and the overall interestingness of the generated levels. Unlike typical quality diversity approaches that rely on random generation and hope to get good coverage of the expressive range, this approach systematically traverses the grid ensuring more coverage.

Counterfactual misses, which are poor decisions that are attributable to using AI, may have disproportionate disutility to AI deployment decision makers. Counterfactual hits, which are good decisions attributable to AI usage, may provide little benefit beyond the benefit of better decisions. This paper explores how to include counterfactual outcomes into usage decision expected utility assessments. Several properties emerge when counterfactuals are explicitly included. First, there are many contexts where the expected utility of AI usage is positive for intended beneficiaries and strongly negative for stakeholders and deployment decision makers. Second, high levels of complementarity, where differing AI and user assessments are merged beneficially, often leads to substantial disutility for stakeholders. Third, apparently small changes in how users interact with an AI capability can substantially impact stakeholder utility. Fourth, cognitive biases such as expert overconfidence and hindsight bias exacerbate the perceived frequency of costly counterfactual misses. The expected utility assessment approach presented here is intended to help AI developers and deployment decision makers to navigate the subtle but substantial impact of counterfactuals so as to better ensure that beneficial AI capabilities are used.'}

However, the statistical training methods for LLMs have raised concerns about their representation of under-represented topics, potentially leading to biases that could influence real-world decisions and opportunities. These biases could have significant economic, social, and cultural impacts as LLMs become more prevalent, whether through direct interactions--such as when users engage with chatbots or automated assistants--or through their integration into third-party applications (as agents), where the models influence decision-making processes and functionalities behind the scenes. Our study examines the biases present in LLMs recommendations of U.S. cities and towns across three domains: relocation, tourism, and starting a business. We explore two key research questions: (i) How similar LLMs responses are, and (ii) How this similarity might favor areas with certain characteristics over others, introducing biases. We focus on the consistency of LLMs responses and their tendency to over-represent or under-represent specific locations. Our findings point to consistent demographic biases in these recommendations, which could perpetuate a ``rich-get-richer'' effect that widens existing economic disparities."}

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems address this issue by grounding LLM responses with external knowledge. This study evaluates the relationship between retriever effectiveness and hallucination reduction in LLMs using three retrieval approaches: sparse retrieval based on BM25 keyword search, dense retrieval using semantic search with Sentence Transformers, and a proposed hybrid retrieval module. The hybrid module incorporates query expansion and combines the results of sparse and dense retrievers through a dynamically weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion score. Using the HaluBench dataset, a benchmark for hallucinations in question answering tasks, we assess retrieval performance with metrics such as mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain, focusing on the relevance of the top three retrieved documents. Results show that the hybrid retriever achieves better relevance scores, outperforming both sparse and dense retrievers. Further evaluation of LLM-generated answers against ground truth using metrics such as accuracy, hallucination rate, and rejection rate reveals that the hybrid retriever achieves the highest accuracy on fails, the lowest hallucination rate, and the lowest rejection rate. These findings highlight the hybrid retriever's ability to enhance retrieval relevance, reduce hallucination rates, and improve LLM reliability, emphasising the importance of advanced retrieval techniques in mitigating hallucinations and improving response accuracy."}

However, traditional recommender systems still have limitations in capturing the dynamic evolution of user behavior. To better understand and predict user behavior, especially taking into account the complexity of temporal evolution, sequential recommender systems have gradually become the focus of research. Currently, many sequential recommendation algorithms ignore the amplification effects of prevalent biases, which leads to recommendation results being susceptible to the Matthew Effect. Additionally, it will impose limitations on the recommender system's ability to deeply perceive and capture the dynamic shifts in user preferences, thereby diminishing the extent of its recommendation reach. To address this issue effectively, we propose a recommendation system based on sequential information and attention mechanism called Multi-Perspective Attention Bias Sequential Recommendation (MABSRec). Firstly, we reconstruct user sequences into three short types and utilize graph neural networks for item weighting. Subsequently, an adaptive multi-bias perspective attention module is proposed to enhance the accuracy of recommendations. Experimental results show that the MABSRec model exhibits significant advantages in all evaluation metrics, demonstrating its excellent performance in the sequence recommendation task."}

Query-to-bidwords(i.e. bidding keywords) rewriting is a vital technique that has garnered significant attention. Recently, with the prevalence of LLMs, generative retrieval methods have proven effective in producing high-relevance rewrites. However, we have identified a significant limitation in existing approaches: While fine-tuning LLMs for specific domains enhances semantic relevance, these models have no perception of the intrinsic value of their generated outputs, such as commercial value. Therefore, after SFT, a RLHF phase is often employed to address this issue. Nevertheless, traditional preference alignment methods often face challenges in aligning fine-grained values and are susceptible to overfitting, which diminishes the effectiveness and quality of the generated results. To address these challenges, we propose VALUE(Value-Aware Large language model for qUery rewriting via wEighted trie), the first framework that ensures the generation of high-value and highly relevant bidwords. Our approach utilizes weighted trie, an innovative modification of the traditional trie data structure. By modulating the LLM's output probability distribution with value information from the trie during decoding process, we constrain the generation space and guide the trajectory of text production. Offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in semantic matching and preference alignment, showing a remarkable improvement in the value attribute by more than fivefold. Online A/B tests further revealed that our Revenue Per Mille (RPM) metric increased by 1.64%.

We propose a comprehensive filtering and enhancement method for large-scale raw BIM log data and introduce a novel command recommendation model. Our model builds upon the state-of-the-art Transformer backbones originally developed for large language models (LLMs), incorporating a custom feature fusion module, dedicated loss function, and targeted learning strategy. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to over 32 billion rows of real-world log data collected globally from the BIM authoring software Vectorworks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can learn universal and generalizable modeling patterns from anonymous user interaction sequences across different countries, disciplines, and projects.

GRec takes comprehensive data signals by utilizing NLP heads, parallel Transformers, as well as a wide and deep structure to process multi-modal inputs. These inputs are then combined and fed through a newly proposed task-sentence level routing mechanism to scale the model capabilities on multiple tasks without compromising performance.

Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information -- i.e., providing evidence for the generated text -- is paramount for LLMs\' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs\' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA.'}

Despite recent advancements, this task remains challenging due to limited training data and laborious triplet annotation processes. To address this issue, this paper proposes to synthesize the training triplets to augment the training resource for the CIR problem. Specifically, we commence by training a modification text generator exploiting large-scale multimodal models and scale up the CIR learning throughout both the pretraining and fine-tuning stages. During pretraining, we leverage the trained generator to directly create Modification Text-oriented Synthetic Triplets(MTST) conditioned on pairs of images. For fine-tuning, we first synthesize reverse modification text to connect the target image back to the reference image. Subsequently, we devise a two-hop alignment strategy to incrementally close the semantic gap between the multimodal pair and the target image. We initially learn an implicit prototype utilizing both the original triplet and its reversed version in a cycle manner, followed by combining the implicit prototype feature with the modification text to facilitate accurate alignment with the target image. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the generated triplets and confirm that our proposed methodology attains competitive recall on both the CIRR and FashionIQ benchmarks.'}

Most existing methods attempt to leverage prior knowledge embedded in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to improve the recommendation performance. However, they often fail to accommodate the differences between the general linguistic knowledge of PLMs and the specific needs of recommendation systems. Moreover, they rarely consider the complementary knowledge between the multimodal information of items, which represents the multi-faceted preferences of users. To facilitate efficient recommendation knowledge transfer, we propose a novel approach called Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation (MQL4GRec). Our key idea is to transform items from different domains and modalities into a unified language, which can serve as a bridge for transferring recommendation knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce quantitative translators to convert the text and image content of items from various domains into a new and concise language, known as quantitative language, with all items sharing the same vocabulary. Then, we design a series of quantitative language generation tasks to enrich quantitative language with semantic information and prior knowledge. Finally, we achieve the transfer of recommendation knowledge from different domains and modalities to the recommendation task through pre-training and fine-tuning.

This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance.

The compression of large language models (LLMs) offers an effective solution to reduce cost of computational resources. However, systematic studies on the performance of compressed LLMs in complex reasoning tasks, especially for LRMs, are lacking. Most works on quantization and pruning focus on preserving language modeling performance, while existing distillation works do not comprehensively benchmark student models based on reasoning difficulty or compression impact on knowledge and reasoning. In this paper, we benchmark compressed DeepSeek-R1 models on four different reasoning datasets (AIME 2024, FOLIO, Temporal Sequences of BIG-Bench Hard, and MuSiQue), ranging from mathematical to multihop reasoning, using quantization, distillation, and pruning methods. We benchmark 2.51-, 1.73-, and 1.58-bit R1 models that adopt dynamic quantization. We also benchmark distilled R1 models that are based on LLaMA or Qwen and run SparseGPT on them to obtain various sparsity levels. Studying the performance and behavior of compressed LRMs, we report their performance scores and test-time compute (number of tokens spent on each question). Notably, using MuSiQue, we find that parameter count has a much greater impact on LRMs' knowledge memorization than on their reasoning capability, which can inform the choice of compression techniques. Through our empirical analysis of test-time compute, we find that shorter model outputs generally achieve better performance than longer ones across several benchmarks for both R1 and its compressed variants, highlighting the need for more concise reasoning chains."}
