Personalized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which retrieves relevant documents from the user's history to reflect their preferences and enhance LLM generation, is one commonly used approach for personalization. However, existing personalized RAG methods do not consider that the histories of similar users can also assist in personalized generation for the current user, meaning that collaborative information between users can also benefit personalized generation. Inspired by the application of collaborative filtering in recommender systems, we propose a method called CFRAG, which adapts Collaborative Filtering to RAG for personalized text generation. However, this presents two challenges: (1)~how to incorporate collaborative information without explicit user similarity labels? (2)~how to retrieve documents that support personalized LLM generation? For Challenge 1, we use contrastive learning to train user embeddings to retrieve similar users and introduce collaborative information. For Challenge 2, we design a personalized retriever and reranker to retrieve the top-$k$ documents from these users' histories. We take into account the user's preference during retrieval and reranking. Then we leverage feedback from the LLM to fine-tune the personalized retriever and reranker, enabling them to retrieve documents that meet the personalized generation needs of the LLM. Experimental results on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP) benchmark validate the effectiveness of CFRAG. Further analysis confirms the importance of incorporating collaborative information."}

By leveraging these data for training machine learning models,researchers have devised novel data-driven methodologies that address the personalized route recommendation (PRR) problem. In contrast to conventional algorithms such as Dijkstra shortest path algorithm,these novel algorithms possess the capacity to discern and learn patterns within the data,thereby facilitating the generation of more personalized paths. However,once these models have been trained,their application is constrained to the generation of routes that align with their training patterns. This limitation renders them less adaptable to novel scenarios and the deployment of multiple machine learning models might be necessary to address new possible scenarios,which can be costly as each model must be trained separately. Inspired by recent advances in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs),we leveraged their natural language understanding capabilities to develop a unified model to solve the PRR problem while being seamlessly adaptable to new scenarios without additional training. To accomplish this,we combined the extensive knowledge LLMs acquired during training with further access to external hand-crafted context information,similar to RAG (Retrieved Augmented Generation) systems,to enhance their ability to generate paths according to user-defined requirements. Extensive experiments on different datasets show a considerable uplift in LLM performance on the PRR problem.'}

This method has been widely applied in tasks such as Question Answering (QA). However, existing RAG methods struggle with open-domain QA tasks because they perform independent retrieval operations and directly incorporate the retrieved information into generation without maintaining a summarizing memory or using adaptive retrieval strategies, leading to noise from redundant information and insufficient information integration. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive memory-based optimization for enhanced RAG (Amber) for open-domain QA tasks, which comprises an Agent-based Memory Updater, an Adaptive Information Collector, and a Multi-granular Content Filter, working together within an iterative memory updating paradigm. Specifically, Amber integrates and optimizes the language model's memory through a multi-agent collaborative approach, ensuring comprehensive knowledge integration from previous retrieval steps. It dynamically adjusts retrieval queries and decides when to stop retrieval based on the accumulated knowledge, enhancing retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, it reduces noise by filtering irrelevant content at multiple levels, retaining essential information to improve overall model performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several open-domain QA datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method and its components.

However, user's query may be incorrect due to ambiguous input and typo, leading to inaccurate search. These cases may be released by query rewrite: modify query to other representation or expansion. However, traditional query rewrite replies on static rewrite vocabulary, which is manually established meanwhile lacks interaction with both domain knowledge in e-Commercial system and common knowledge in the real world. In this paper, with the ability to generate text content of Large Language Models (LLMs), we provide an iterative framework to generate query rewrite. The framework incorporates a 3-stage procedure in each iteration: Rewrite Generation with domain knowledge by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and query understanding by Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT); Online Signal Collection with automatic positive rewrite update; Post-training of LLM with multi task objective to generate new rewrites. Our work (named as IterQR) provides a comprehensive framework to generate \\textbf{Q}uery \\textbf{R}ewrite with both domain / real-world knowledge.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) retrieves relevant data that fit into an LLM's context window and prompts the LLM for an answer. GraphRAG extends this approach to structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and questions regarding entities multiple hops away. The majority of recent GraphRAG methods either overlook the retrieval step or have ad hoc retrieval processes that are abstract or inefficient. This prevents them from being adopted when the KGs are stored in graph databases supporting graph query languages. In this work, we present GraphRAFT, a retrieve-and-reason framework that finetunes LLMs to generate provably correct Cypher queries to retrieve high-quality subgraph contexts and produce accurate answers. Our method is the first such solution that can be taken off-the-shelf and used on KGs stored in native graph DBs. Benchmarks suggest that our method is sample-efficient and scales with the availability of training data. Our method achieves significantly better results than all state-of-the-art models across all four standard metrics on two challenging Q\\&As on large text-attributed KGs."}
