This is particularly challenging in problems under uncertainty and in Bayesian reasoning. With the new generation of large language models (LLMs) capable of reasoning using Chain-of-Thought (CoT), there is an excellent opportunity to learn with them as they explain their reasoning through a dialogue with their artificial internal voice. It is an engaging and excellent opportunity to learn Bayesian reasoning. Furthermore, given that different LLMs sometimes arrive at opposite solutions, CoT generates opportunities for deep learning by detailed comparisons of reasonings. However, unlike humans, we found that they do not autonomously explain using ecologically valid strategies like natural frequencies, whole objects, and embodied heuristics. This is unfortunate, as these strategies help humans avoid critical mistakes and have proven pedagogical value in Bayesian reasoning. In order to overcome these biases and aid understanding and learning, we included prompts that induce LLMs to use these strategies. We found that LLMs with CoT incorporate them but not consistently. They show persistent biases towards symbolic reasoning and avoidance or phobia of ecologically valid strategies."}

To measure the predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population.

While this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient optimization.'}

Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address this issue, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM equipped with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms. The global VPP overlays learnable, axis-like embeddings onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues.

We use the TIdigits dataset of spoken digits with a formant decomposition and rate-based encoding into spikes. We compare three Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) architectures to learn and classify spatio-temporal signals. The proposed SNN architectures are made of three layers with variation in its hidden layer composed of either (1) feedforward TDE, (2) feedforward Current-Based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CuBa-LIF), or (3) recurrent CuBa-LIF neurons. We first show that the spike trains of the frequency-converted spoken digits have a large amount of information in the temporal domain, reinforcing the importance of better exploiting temporal encoding for such a task. We then train the three SNNs with the same number of synaptic weights to quantify and compare their performance based on the accuracy and synaptic operations. The resulting accuracy of the feedforward TDE network (89%) is higher than the feedforward CuBa-LIF network (71%) and close to the recurrent CuBa-LIF network (91%). However, the feedforward TDE-based network performs 92% fewer synaptic operations than the recurrent CuBa-LIF network with the same amount of synapses.

Current fake image detection methods predominantly rely on binary classification models that focus on accuracy while often neglecting interpretability, leaving users without clear insights into why an image is deemed real or fake. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruthLens, a novel training-free framework that reimagines deepfake detection as a visual question-answering (VQA) task. TruthLens utilizes state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs) to observe and describe visual artifacts and combines this with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to analyze and aggregate evidence into informed decisions. By adopting a multimodal approach, TruthLens seamlessly integrates visual and semantic reasoning to not only classify images as real or fake but also provide interpretable explanations for its decisions. This transparency enhances trust and provides valuable insights into the artifacts that signal synthetic content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms conventional methods, achieving high accuracy on challenging datasets while maintaining a strong emphasis on explainability. By reframing deepfake detection as a reasoning-driven process, TruthLens establishes a new paradigm in combating synthetic media, combining cutting-edge performance with interpretability to address the growing threats of visual disinformation.'}

Despite their importance, NFRs are often overlooked or difficult to identify, impacting software quality. To support requirements engineers in eliciting NFRs, we developed a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive quality-driven NFRs from functional requirements (FRs). Using a custom prompting technique within a Deno-based pipeline, the system identifies relevant quality attributes for each functional requirement and generates corresponding NFRs, aiding systematic integration. A crucial aspect is evaluating the quality and suitability of these generated requirements. Can LLMs produce high-quality NFR suggestions? Using 34 functional requirements - selected as a representative subset of 3,964 FRs-the LLMs inferred applicable attributes based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023 standard, generating 1,593 NFRs. A horizontal evaluation covered three dimensions: NFR validity, applicability of quality attributes, and classification precision. Ten industry software quality evaluators, averaging 13 years of experience, assessed a subset for relevance and quality. The evaluation showed strong alignment between LLM-generated NFRs and expert assessments, with median validity and applicability scores of 5.0 (means: 4.63 and 4.59, respectively) on a 1-5 scale. In the classification task, 80.4% of LLM-assigned attributes matched expert choices, with 8.3% near misses and 11.3% mismatches. A comparative analysis of eight LLMs highlighted variations in performance, with gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting the highest attribute accuracy, while llama-3.3-70B achieved higher validity and applicability scores.

Concept-based post-hoc explanation methods can provide both global and local insights into model decisions. However, current methods in this field face challenges in that they are inflexible to automatically construct accurate and sufficient linguistic explanations for global concepts and local circuits. Particularly, the intrinsic polysemanticity in semantic Visual Concepts (VCs) impedes the interpretability of concepts and DVMs, which is underestimated severely. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Explanation (CoE) approach to address these issues. Specifically, CoE automates the decoding and description of VCs to construct global concept explanation datasets. Further, to alleviate the effect of polysemanticity on model explainability, we design a concept polysemanticity disentanglement and filtering mechanism to distinguish the most contextually relevant concept atoms. Besides, a Concept Polysemanticity Entropy (CPE), as a measure of model interpretability, is formulated to quantify the degree of concept uncertainty. The modeling of deterministic concepts is upgraded to uncertain concept atom distributions. Finally, CoE automatically enables linguistic local explanations of the decision-making process of DVMs by tracing the concept circuit. GPT-4o and human-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CPE and the superiority of CoE, achieving an average absolute improvement of 36% in terms of explainability scores.'}

Our approach includes pre-execution verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in AI2-THOR simulator.

To this end, we introduce ProtoOcc, a novel occupancy network that leverages prototypes of clustered image segments in view transformation to enhance low-resolution context. In particular, the mapping of 2D prototypes onto 3D voxel queries encodes high-level visual geometries and complements the loss of spatial information from reduced query resolutions. Additionally, we design a multi-perspective decoding strategy to efficiently disentangle the densely compressed visual cues into a high-dimensional 3D occupancy scene. Experimental results on both Occ3D and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing clear improvements over the baselines.

Graduate-trained biologists tasked with predicting the consequences of releasing mirror E. coli showed no significant differences in rubric-graded accuracy using Claude Sonnet 3.5 new (n=10) or web search only (n=2); both groups scored comparably to a web baseline (28 and 43 versus 36).

Continued advances may allow future models to disclose novel CBRN threats to naive experts (Stage 3) or unskilled users (Stage 4).

Through systematic experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that hyperbolic geometry offers distinct advantages for concept removal, achieving near perfect forgetting with reasonable performance on retained concepts, particularly when scaling to multiple concept removal. Our approach introduces hyperbolic-specific components including entailment calibration and norm regularization that leverage the unique properties of hyperbolic space. Comparative analysis with Euclidean models reveals fundamental differences in unlearning dynamics, with hyperbolic unlearning reorganizing the semantic hierarchy while Euclidean approaches merely disconnect cross-modal associations.

Thereby, a sufficiently good minima in sensory activity can be the complete reward signal of the network, as well as being both necessary and sufficient for biological learning to arise. We show that this method of learning was likely already present in the earliest unicellular life forms on earth. We show evidence that the same principle holds and scales to multicellular organisms where it in addition can lead to division of labour between cells. Available evidence shows that the evolution of the nervous system likely was an adaptation to more effectively communicate intercellular signals to support such division of labour. We therefore propose that the same learning principle that evolved already in the earliest unicellular life forms, i.e. negative feedback control of externally and internally generated sensor signals, has simply been scaled up to become a fundament of the learning we see in biological brains today. We illustrate diverse biological settings, from the earliest unicellular organisms to humans, where this operational principle appears to be a plausible interpretation of the meaning of sensor signals in biology, and how this relates to current neuroscientific theories and findings.'}

However, contemporary methodologies, such as deterministic and imitation learning-based driver models, struggle to capture the variability of human-like driving behavior. Given these challenges, we propose HAD-Gen, a general framework for realistic traffic scenario generation that simulates diverse human-like driving behaviors. The framework first clusters the vehicle trajectory data into different driving styles according to safety features. It then employs maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning on each of the clusters to learn the reward function corresponding to each driving style. Using these reward functions, the method integrates offline reinforcement learning pre-training and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms to obtain general and robust driving policies. Multi-perspective simulation results show that our proposed scenario generation framework can simulate diverse, human-like driving behaviors with strong generalization capability. The proposed framework achieves a 90.96% goal-reaching rate, an off-road rate of 2.08%, and a collision rate of 6.91% in the generalization test, outperforming prior approaches by over 20% in goal-reaching performance.

Deep CNNs and vision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial performance. However, challenges related to model complexity and contrast, texture, and tumor morphology variations introduce uncertainties that hinder the effectiveness of current methods. This study introduces a novel hybrid framework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT components for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem convolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new Regional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast and morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global contextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational efficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse residual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture information and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted (CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by combining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual CNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial attention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving the discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed CB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of 96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI dataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods. These results demonstrate the versatility of our integrated CNN-Transformer framework in capturing diverse features and delivering superior performance in BUSI cancer diagnosis.'}

Despite recent progress, existing methods struggle to achieve unified cross-modal alignment across semantics, timbre, and emotional prosody from visual cues, prompting us to propose Consistent Video-to-Speech (CV2S) as an extended task to enhance cross-modal consistency. To tackle emerging challenges, we introduce ImaginTalk, a novel cross-modal diffusion framework that generates faithful speech using only visual input, operating within a discrete space. Specifically, we propose a discrete lip aligner that predicts discrete speech tokens from lip videos to capture semantic information, while an error detector identifies misaligned tokens, which are subsequently refined through masked language modeling with BERT. To further enhance the expressiveness of the generated speech, we develop a style diffusion transformer equipped with a face-style adapter that adaptively customizes identity and prosody dynamics across both the channel and temporal dimensions while ensuring synchronization with lip-aware semantic features.

However, recent research has shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a new type of threat called the backdoor attack, where the adversary can inject a hidden backdoor into the GCNs so that the backdoored model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed to the attacker-specified target label if the hidden backdoor is activated by the attacker-defined trigger. Clean-label backdoor attack and semantic backdoor attack are two new backdoor attacks to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they are more imperceptible and have posed new and serious threats. The semantic and clean-label backdoor attack is not fully explored in GCNs. In this paper, we propose a semantic and clean-label backdoor attack against GCNs under the context of graph classification to reveal the existence of this security vulnerability in GCNs. Specifically, SCLBA conducts an importance analysis on graph samples to select one type of node as semantic trigger, which is then inserted into the graph samples to create poisoning samples without changing the labels of the poisoning samples to the attacker-specified target label. We evaluate SCLBA on multiple datasets and the results show that SCLBA can achieve attack success rates close to 99% with poisoning rates of less than 3%, and with almost no impact on the performance of model on benign samples.'}

Thus, to safeguard individuals\' "right to be forgotten", there has been increasing interests in machine unlearning -- the process of removing information carried by particular training samples from a model while not deteriorating its predictive quality. This is a challenging task due to the black-box nature of language models. Most existing studies focus on mitigating the impact of those forgot samples upon a model\'s outputs, and do not explicitly consider the geometric distributions of samples in the latent space of a model.

Although advanced quantization techniques have successfully minimized memory usage for inference, training and fine-tuning these quantized models still require large memory possibly due to dequantization for accurate computation of gradients and/or backpropagation for gradient-based algorithms. However, memory-efficient fine-tuning is particularly desirable for applications such as personalization that often must be run on edge devices like mobile phones with private data. In this work, we address this challenge by quantizing a diffusion model with personalization via Textual Inversion and by leveraging a zeroth-order optimization on personalization tokens without dequantization so that it does not require gradient and activation storage for backpropagation that consumes considerable memory. Since a gradient estimation using zeroth-order optimization is quite noisy for a single or a few images in personalization, we propose to denoise the estimated gradient by projecting it onto a subspace that is constructed with the past history of the tokens, dubbed Subspace Gradient. In addition, we investigated the influence of text embedding in image generation, leading to our proposed time steps sampling, dubbed Partial Uniform Timestep Sampling for sampling with effective diffusion timesteps.

However, a major challenge in using these datasets is their lack of reliable labels: there are myriad types of incidents, many types occur rarely, and ground-truth measures of where incidents occur are lacking. Here, we propose BayFlood, a two-stage approach which circumvents this difficulty. First, we perform zero-shot classification of where incidents occur using a pretrained vision-language model (VLM). Second, we fit a spatial Bayesian model on the VLM classifications. The zero-shot approach avoids the need to annotate large training sets, and the Bayesian model provides frequent desiderata in urban settings - principled measures of uncertainty, smoothing across locations, and incorporation of external data like stormwater accumulation zones. We comprehensively validate this two-stage approach, showing that VLMs provide strong zero-shot signal for floods across multiple cities and time periods, the Bayesian model improves out-of-sample prediction relative to baseline methods, and our inferred flood risk correlates with known external predictors of risk. Having validated our approach, we show it can be used to improve urban flood detection: our analysis reveals 113,738 people who are at high risk of flooding overlooked by current methods, identifies demographic biases in existing methods, and suggests locations for new flood sensors. More broadly, our results showcase how Bayesian modeling of zero-shot LM annotations represents a promising paradigm because it avoids the need to collect large labeled datasets and leverages the power of foundation models while providing the expressiveness and uncertainty quantification of Bayesian models.'}

This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach to detect the scaffolding and its cross braces using computer vision. A scaffold image dataset with annotated labels is used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. With the proposed approach, we can automatically detect the completeness of cross braces from images taken at construction sites, without the need for manual inspection, saving a significant amount of time and labor costs. This non-invasive and efficient solution for detecting scaffolding completeness can help improve safety in construction sites."}

Despite recent advancements, we find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been applied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current methods but also hinders future advancements.\nTo address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image synthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We study eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on model architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2) Evaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to thoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting downstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set not only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench corrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation protocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates current and future implementations within a unified framework. With DPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the common wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial, we find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive images significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does not always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional features, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less affected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional features, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the latter under a low privacy budget.'}

However, existing visual explanation methods can not display the attention flow hidden inside the inner structure of ViT models, which explains how the final attention regions are formed inside a ViT for its decision-making. In this paper, a novel visual explanation approach, Dynamic Accumulated Attention Map (DAAM), is proposed to provide a tool that can visualize, for the first time, the attention flow from the top to the bottom through ViT networks. To this end, a novel decomposition module is proposed to construct and store the spatial feature information by unlocking the [class] token generated by the self-attention module of each ViT block. The module can also obtain the channel importance coefficients by decomposing the classification score for supervised ViT models. Because of the lack of classification score in self-supervised ViT models, we propose dimension-wise importance weights to compute the channel importance coefficients. Such spatial features are linearly combined with the corresponding channel importance coefficients, forming the attention map for each block. The dynamic attention flow is revealed by block-wisely accumulating each attention map. The contribution of this work focuses on visualizing the evolution dynamic of the decision-making attention for any intermediate block inside a ViT model by proposing a novel decomposition module and dimension-wise importance weights.

Current data governors circumvent this complexity by estimating sample contributions through heuristic-derived scalar scores, thereby discarding low-value ones. Despite thorough sample sieving, retained samples contain substantial undesired tokens intrinsically, underscoring the potential for further compression and purification. In this work, we upgrade data governance from a 'sieving' approach to a 'juicing' one. Instead of scanning for least-flawed samples, our dual-branch DataJuicer applies finer-grained intra-sample governance. It squeezes out informative tokens and boosts image-text alignments. Specifically, the vision branch retains salient image patches and extracts relevant object classes, while the text branch incorporates these classes to enhance captions.

Key AI applications include predictive analytics for demand forecasting, route optimization through machine learning, and AI-powered fuel efficiency strategies. Various models, such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and Neural Networks, are applied to real-world logistics datasets to reduce carbon emissions based on logistics operations, optimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time, and predict future deliveries to plan optimal routes. Other models such as K-Means and DBSCAN are also used to optimize travel routes to minimize distance and travel time for logistics operations. This study utilizes datasets from logistics companies' databases. The study also assesses model performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R2 score. This study also explores how these models can be deployed to various platforms for real-time logistics and supply chain use.

However, these systems are unable to perform well on any other setting than the one they have been trained on, and struggle to successfully cooperate with unfamiliar collaborators. This is particularly visible in the Hanabi benchmark, a popular 2-to-5 player cooperative card-game which requires complex reasoning and precise assistance to other agents. Current MARL agents for Hanabi can only learn one specific game-setting (e.g., 2-player games), and play with the same algorithmic agents. This is in stark contrast to humans, who can quickly adjust their strategies to work with unfamiliar partners or situations. In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Replay Relevance Distributed DQN (R3D2), a generalist agent for Hanabi, designed to overcome these limitations. We reformulate the task using text, as language has been shown to improve transfer. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm that copes with the resulting dynamic observation- and action-space. In doing so, our agent is the first that can play all game settings concurrently, and extend strategies learned from one setting to other ones. As a consequence, our agent also demonstrates the ability to collaborate with different algorithmic agents -- agents that are themselves unable to do so.

However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms do not consider that physical environments do not wait for the RL agent to make decisions or updates. RL agents learn by periodically conducting computationally expensive gradient updates. When decision-making and gradient update tasks are carried out sequentially by the RL agent in a physical robot, it significantly increases the agent's response time. In a rapidly changing environment, this increased response time may be detrimental to the performance of the learning agent. Asynchronous RL methods, which separate the computation of decision-making and gradient updates, are a potential solution to this problem. However, only a few comparisons between asynchronous and synchronous RL have been made with physical robots. For this reason, the exact performance benefits of using asynchronous RL methods over synchronous RL methods are still unclear. In this study, we provide a performance comparison between asynchronous and synchronous RL using a physical robotic arm called Franka Emika Panda. Our experiments show that the agents learn faster and attain significantly more returns using asynchronous RL. Our experiments also demonstrate that the learning agent with a faster response time performs better than the agent with a slower response time, even if the agent with a slower response time performs a higher number of gradient updates."}

In this retrospective study of 116,135 women from two healthcare systems, a transformer-based neural network quantified BAC severity (no BAC, mild, moderate, and severe) on screening mammograms. Outcomes included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. BAC severity was independently associated with MACE after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, with increasing hazard ratios from mild (HR 1.18-1.22), moderate (HR 1.38-1.47), to severe BAC (HR 2.03-2.22) across datasets (all p<0.001). This association remained significant across all age groups, with even mild BAC indicating increased risk in women under 50. BAC remained an independent predictor when analyzed alongside ASCVD risk scores, showing significant associations with myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and mortality (all p<0.005). Automated BAC quantification enables opportunistic cardiovascular risk assessment during routine mammography without additional radiation or cost.

In its most basic form, an explicit, Neural Network (NN) free formulation, DF leverages the linear solvability of the the underlying MDP to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov Process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution.

To address this issue, we introduce SAUCE, a novel method that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for fine-grained and selective concept unlearning in VLMs. Briefly, SAUCE first trains SAEs to capture high-dimensional, semantically rich sparse features. It then identifies the features most relevant to the target concept for unlearning. During inference, it selectively modifies these features to suppress specific concepts while preserving unrelated information. We evaluate SAUCE on two distinct VLMs, LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct, across two types of tasks: concrete concept unlearning (objects and sports scenes) and abstract concept unlearning (emotions, colors, and materials), encompassing a total of 60 concepts.

We propose a diffusion-transformer-based 3D talking face generation model, Cafe-Talk, which simultaneously incorporates coarse- and fine-grained multimodal control conditions. Nevertheless, the entanglement of multiple conditions challenges achieving satisfying performance. To disentangle speech audio and fine-grained conditions, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. Specifically, Cafe-Talk is initially trained using only speech audio and coarse-grained conditions. Then, a proposed fine-grained control adapter gradually adds fine-grained instructions represented by action units (AUs), preventing unfavorable speech-lip synchronization. To disentangle coarse- and fine-grained conditions, we design a swap-label training mechanism, which enables the dominance of the fine-grained conditions. We also devise a mask-based CFG technique to regulate the occurrence and intensity of fine-grained control. In addition, a text-based detector is introduced with text-AU alignment to enable natural language user input and further support multimodal control.

Automatic emotion recognition uses machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to recognize a person's emotional state from various data types, such as text, images, sound, and body motion. Body motion poses unique challenges as many factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, personality, and illness, affect its appearance, leading to a lack of diverse and robust datasets specifically for emotion recognition. To address this, employing Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), offers potential solutions, though these methods are often complex. This research introduces a novel application of the Neural Gas Network (NGN) algorithm for synthesizing body motion data and optimizing diversity and generation speed. By learning skeletal structure topology, the NGN fits the neurons or gas particles on body joints. Generated gas particles, which form the skeletal structure later on, will be used to synthesize the new body posture. By attaching body postures over frames, the final synthetic body motion appears. We compared our generated dataset against others generated by GANs, VAEs, and another benchmark algorithm, using benchmark metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), Diversity, and a few more. Furthermore, we continued evaluation using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and a few others. Joint-related features or kinematic parameters were extracted, and the system assessed model performance against unseen data. Our findings demonstrate that the NGN algorithm produces more realistic and emotionally distinct body motion data and does so with more synthesizing speed than existing methods."}
