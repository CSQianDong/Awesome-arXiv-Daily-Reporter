We introduce AIDG (Adversarial Information Deduction Game), a game-theoretic framework that probes the asymmetry between information extraction (active deduction) and information containment (state maintenance) in dialogue. We propose two complementary tasks: AIDG-I, measuring pragmatic strategy in social deduction, and AIDG-II, measuring constraint satisfaction in a structured "20 Questions" setting. Across 439 games with six frontier LLMs, we observe a clear capability asymmetry: models perform substantially better at containment than deduction, with a 350 ELO advantage on defense;(Cohen\'s d = 5.47). We identify two bottlenecks driving this gap: (1) Information Dynamics, where confirmation strategies are 7.75x more effective than blind deduction (p < 0.00001), and (2) Constraint Adherence, where instruction-following degrades under conversational load, accounting for 41.3% of deductive failures. These findings suggest that while LLMs excel at local defensive coherence, they struggle with the global state tracking required for strategic inquiry.'}

However, KC-level correctness labels are rarely available in real-world datasets, especially for open-ended programming tasks where solutions typically involve multiple KCs simultaneously. Simply propagating problem-level correctness to all associated KCs obscures partial mastery and often leads to poorly fitted learning curves. To address this challenge, we propose an automated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to label KC-level correctness directly from student-written code. Our method assesses whether each KC is correctly applied and further introduces a temporal context-aware Code-KC mapping mechanism to better align KCs with individual student code. We evaluate the resulting KC-level correctness labels in terms of learning curve fit and predictive performance using the power law of practice and the Additive Factors Model. Experimental results show that our framework leads to learning curves that are more consistent with cognitive theory and improves predictive performance, compared to baselines. Human evaluation further demonstrates substantial agreement between LLM and expert annotations.'}

We evaluate models from three major families-Llama-3, Gemma-3, and Qwen3-across 20 clinical NLP tasks among Named Entity Recognition, Relation Extraction, Case Report Form Filling, Question Answering, and Argument Mining. We systematically compare a range of adaptation strategies, both at inference time (few-shot prompting, constraint decoding) and at training time (supervised fine-tuning, continual pretraining). Fine-tuning emerges as the most effective approach, while the combination of few-shot prompting and constraint decoding offers strong lower-resource alternatives. Our results show that small LLMs can match or even surpass larger baselines, with our best configuration based on Qwen3-1.7B achieving an average score +9.2 points higher than Qwen3-32B. We release a comprehensive collection of all the publicly available Italian medical datasets for NLP tasks, together with our top-performing models.

This paper examines how controlled, truth-conditionally equivalent lexical and syntactic perturbations affect the absolute performance and relative ranking of 23 contemporary LLMs across three benchmarks: MMLU, SQuAD, and AMEGA. We employ two linguistically principled pipelines to generate meaning-preserving variations: one performing synonym substitution for lexical changes, and another using dependency parsing to determine applicable syntactic transformations. Results show that lexical perturbations consistently induce substantial, statistically significant performance degradation across nearly all models and tasks, while syntactic perturbations have more heterogeneous effects, occasionally improving results. Both perturbation types destabilize model leaderboards on complex tasks. Furthermore, model robustness did not consistently scale with model size, revealing strong task dependence. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs rely more on surface-level lexical patterns than on abstract linguistic competence, underscoring the need for robustness testing as a standard component of LLM evaluation.'}

The availability heuristic, proposed by A. Tversky and D. Kahneman in 1973, suggests that the ease with which relevant instances come to mind, typically operationalised by the mere frequency of exposure, can offer a mental shortcut for problems in which the test-taker does not know the exact answer. Is simply choosing the option that comes most readily to mind a good strategy for answering MCQs? We propose a computational method of assessing the cognitive availability of MCQ options operationalised by concepts' prevalence in large corpora. The key finding, across three large question sets, is that correct answers, independently of the question stem, are significantly more available than incorrect MCQ options. Specifically, using Wikipedia as the retrieval corpus, we find that always selecting the most available option leads to scores 13.5% to 32.9% above the random-guess baseline. We further find that LLM-generated MCQ options show similar patterns of availability compared to expert-created options, despite the LLMs' frequentist nature and their training on large collections of textual data. Our findings suggest that availability should be considered in current and future work when computationally modelling student behaviour."}

Data selection techniques can effectively reduce the amount of training data required for fine-tuning LMs. However, their effectiveness is closely related to computational resources, which always require a high compute budget. Owing to the resource limitations in practical fine-tuning scenario, we systematically reveal the relationship between data selection and uncertainty estimation of selected data. Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation, which provide new ways to alleviate data scarcity, evaluating data usability remains a challenging task. This makes efficient data selection indispensable. To mitigate these issues, we propose Entropy-Based Unsupervised Data Selection (EUDS) framework. Empirical experiments on sentiment analysis (SA), topic classification (Topic-CLS), and question answering (Q&A) tasks validate its effectiveness. EUDS establishes a computationally efficient data-filtering mechanism. Theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

Yet these instruments presume honest responding; in evaluative contexts, LLMs can instead gravitate toward socially preferred answers-a form of socially desirable responding (SDR)-biasing questionnaire-derived scores and downstream conclusions. We propose a psychometric framework to quantify and mitigate SDR in questionnaire-based evaluation of LLMs. To quantify SDR, the same inventory is administered under HONEST versus FAKE-GOOD instructions, and SDR is computed as a direction-corrected standardized effect size from item response theory (IRT)-estimated latent scores. This enables comparisons across constructs and response formats, as well as against human instructed-faking benchmarks. For mitigation, we construct a graded forced-choice (GFC) Big Five inventory by selecting 30 cross-domain pairs from an item pool via constrained optimization to match desirability. Across nine instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on synthetic personas with known target profiles, Likert-style questionnaires show consistently large SDR, whereas desirability-matched GFC substantially attenuates SDR while largely preserving the recovery of the intended persona profiles. These results highlight a model-dependent SDR-recovery trade-off and motivate SDR-aware reporting practices for questionnaire-based benchmarking and auditing of LLMs.'}

However, these models still exhibit low accuracy in core banking computations-including total payout estimation, comparison of products with varying interest rates, and interest calculation under early repayment conditions. Such tasks require multi-step numerical reasoning and contextual understanding of banking products, yet existing LLMs often make systematic errors-misinterpreting product types, applying conditions incorrectly, or failing basic calculations involving exponents and geometric progressions. However, such errors have rarely been captured by existing benchmarks. Mathematical datasets focus on fundamental math problems, whereas financial benchmarks primarily target financial documents, leaving everyday banking scenarios underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose BankMathBench, a domain-specific dataset that reflects realistic banking tasks. BankMathBench is organized in three levels of difficulty-basic, intermediate, and advanced-corresponding to single-product reasoning, multi-product comparison, and multi-condition scenarios, respectively. When trained on BankMathBench, open-source LLMs exhibited notable improvements in both formula generation and numerical reasoning accuracy, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in enhancing domain-specific reasoning.

Rather than focusing on error prevention, this work focuses on error recovery, which necessitates the accurate diagnosis of erroneous dialogue contexts and execution of proper recovery plans. Under realistic constraints precluding model fine-tuning or prompt modification due to significant cost and time requirements, we explore whether agents can recover from contextually flawed interactions and how their behavior can be adapted without altering model parameters and prompts. To this end, we propose Reasoning Inception (ReIn), a test-time intervention method that plants an initial reasoning into the agent's decision-making process. Specifically, an external inception module identifies predefined errors within the dialogue context and generates recovery plans, which are subsequently integrated into the agent's internal reasoning process to guide corrective actions, without modifying its parameters or system prompts. We evaluate ReIn by systematically simulating conversational failure scenarios that directly hinder successful completion of user goals: user's ambiguous and unsupported requests. Across diverse combinations of agent models and inception modules, ReIn substantially improves task success and generalizes to unseen error types. Moreover, it consistently outperforms explicit prompt-modification approaches, underscoring its utility as an efficient, on-the-fly method. In-depth analysis of its operational mechanism, particularly in relation to instruction hierarchy, indicates that jointly defining recovery tools with ReIn can serve as a safe and effective strategy for improving the resilience of conversational agents without modifying the backbone models or system prompts."}

However, theoretical work in the field suggests that first-personal interaction is a crucial part of ToM and that such predictive, spectatorial tasks may fail to evaluate it. We address this gap with a novel ToM task that requires an agent to persuade a target to choose one of three policy proposals by strategically revealing information. Success depends on a persuader's sensitivity to a given target's knowledge states (what the target knows about the policies) and motivational states (how much the target values different outcomes). We varied whether these states were Revealed to persuaders or Hidden, in which case persuaders had to inquire about or infer them. In Experiment 1, participants persuaded a bot programmed to make only rational inferences. LLMs excelled in the Revealed condition but performed below chance in the Hidden condition, suggesting difficulty with the multi-step planning required to elicit and use mental state information. Humans performed moderately well in both conditions, indicating an ability to engage such planning. In Experiment 2, where a human target role-played the bot, and in Experiment 3, where we measured whether human targets' real beliefs changed, LLMs outperformed human persuaders across all conditions. These results suggest that effective persuasion can occur without explicit ToM reasoning (e.g., through rhetorical strategies) and that LLMs excel at this form of persuasion. Overall, our results caution against attributing human-like ToM to LLMs while highlighting LLMs' potential to influence people's beliefs and behavior."}

First, we design evaluation protocols that enhance LLM-based evaluators for LLM alignment using reference outputs. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that a reference-guided approach substantially improves the accuracy of less capable LLM-judges using references from frontier models; stronger LLM-judges can also be enhanced by high-quality (i.e., human-written) references. Building on these improved judges, we demonstrate the utility of high-quality references in alignment tuning, where LLMs guided with references are used as judges to self-improve. We show that reference-guided self-improvement yields clear gains over both direct SFT on reference outputs and self-improvement with reference-free judges, achieving performance comparable to training with ArmoRM, a strong finetuned reward model.

To address this limitation, we introduce two novel measures: reusability and verifiability. We decouple CoT generation from execution using a Thinker-Executor framework. Reusability measures how easily an Executor can reuse the Thinker's CoT. Verifiability measures how frequently an Executor can match the Thinker's answer using the CoT. We evaluated four Thinker models against a committee of ten Executor models across five benchmarks. Our results reveal that reusability and verifiability do not correlate with standard accuracy, exposing a blind spot in current accuracy-based leaderboards for reasoning capability.

This work presents the first research in the field of NLP that is explicitly focused on the dialect of Mainz.

It contains 2,351 words in the dialect paired with their meanings described in Standard German. We then use this dataset to answer the following research questions: (1) Can state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) generate definitions for dialect words? (2) Can LLMs generate words in Meenzerisch, given their definitions? Our experiments show that LLMs can do neither: the best model for definitions reaches only 6.27% accuracy and the best word generation model's accuracy is 1.51%. We then conduct two additional experiments in order to see if accuracy is improved by few-shot learning and by extracting rules from the training set, which are then passed to the LLM.

We introduce a formal framework for reasoning faithfulness, defined by two testable conditions: stance consistency (a coherent stance linking reasoning to answer) and causal influence (the stated reasoning causally drives the answer under output-level interventions), explicitly decoupled from accuracy. To operationalize this, we present RFEval, a benchmark of 7,186 instances across seven tasks that probes faithfulness via controlled, output-level counterfactual interventions. Evaluating twelve open-source LRMs, we find unfaithfulness in 49.7% of outputs, predominantly from stance inconsistency. Failures are concentrated in brittle, convergent domains such as math and code, and correlate more with post-training regimes than with scale: within-family ablations indicate that adding current RL-style objectives on top of supervised fine-tuning can reduce reasoning faithfulness, even when accuracy is maintained. Crucially, accuracy is neither a sufficient nor a reliable proxy for faithfulness: once controlling for model and task, the accuracy-faithfulness link is weak and statistically insignificant.

By progressively encoding intermediate reasoning into fixed-size vector representations, our approach eliminates the need to backpropagate through full-cache rollouts, thereby reducing memory usage, while maintaining constant memory during inference. Experiments on three models, including Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, on six widely used challenging mathematical benchmarks show consistent gains: our method achieves +19.3% improvement over LoRA-based fine-tuning and +29.9% over LRMs without fine-tuning on average, with up to +23.4 accuracy improvement on AIME2024/2025 under the same tight cache budgets. These results demonstrate that Progressive Thought Encoding not only improves reasoning accuracy but also makes RL training of LRMs substantially more efficient and scalable under real-world memory constraints.'}

This has led to growing interest in using large language models (LLMs) as proxies for human judges. However, it remains an open question whether LLM-based relevance judgments are reliable, stable, and rigorous enough to match humans for relevance assessment. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of overrating behavior in LLM-based relevance judgments across model backbones, evaluation paradigms (pointwise and pairwise), and passage modification strategies. We show that models consistently assign inflated relevance scores -- often with high confidence -- to passages that do not genuinely satisfy the underlying information need, revealing a system-wide bias rather than random fluctuations in judgment. Furthermore, controlled experiments show that LLM-based relevance judgments can be highly sensitive to passage length and surface-level lexical cues. These results raise concerns about the usage of LLMs as drop-in replacements for human relevance assessors, and highlight the urgent need for careful diagnostic evaluation frameworks when applying LLMs for relevance assessments. Our code and results are publicly available.'}

Subsequent studies further introduce preference learning to incorporate negative samples into the training process. However, existing methods rely on sequence-level, offline-generated negatives, making them less discriminative and informative when adapting LLMs to recommendation tasks with large negative item spaces. To address these challenges, we propose ILRec, a novel preference fine-tuning framework for LLM-based recommendation, leveraging self-hard negative signals extracted from intermediate layers to improve preference learning. Specifically, we identify self-hard negative tokens from intermediate layers as fine-grained negative supervision that dynamically reflects the model's preference learning process. To effectively integrate these signals into training, we design a two-stage framework comprising cross-layer preference optimization and cross-layer preference distillation, enabling the model to jointly discriminate informative negatives and enhance the quality of negative signals from intermediate layers. In addition, we introduce a lightweight collaborative filtering model to assign token-level rewards for negative signals, mitigating the risk of over-penalizing false negatives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate ILRec's effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLM-based recommender systems."}

In this paper, we present a large-scale empirical study investigating the reliability and structure of user-centric CRS evaluation on static dialogue transcripts. We collected 1,053 annotations from 124 crowd workers on 200 ReDial dialogues using the 18-dimensional CRS-Que framework.

Our results show that utilitarian and outcome-oriented dimensions such as accuracy, usefulness, and satisfaction achieve moderate reliability under aggregation, whereas socially grounded constructs such as humanness and rapport are substantially less reliable. Furthermore, many dimensions collapse into a single global quality signal, revealing a strong halo effect in third-party judgments.

Large scale e-commerce search demands embeddings that generalize to long tail, noisy queries while adhering to scalable supervision compatible with product and policy constraints.

To obtain scalable policy consistent supervision, we fine-tune a lightweight LLM on human annotations under a three-level relevance guideline and further reduce residual noise via engagement driven auditing. In Stage 1, we train a multilingual Siamese two-tower retriever with a label aware supervised contrastive objective that shapes a robust global semantic space. In Stage 2, we mine hard samples via ANN and re-annotate them with the policy aligned LLM, and introduce a multi-class extension of circle loss that explicitly sharpens similarity boundaries between relevance levels, to further refine and enrich the embedding space.

In clinical practice, the correct diagnosis can rarely be immediately inferred from the initial patient presentation alone. Rather, reaching a diagnosis often involves systematic history taking, during which clinicians reason over multiple potential conditions through iterative questioning to resolve uncertainty. This process requires considering differential diagnoses and actively excluding emergencies that demand immediate intervention. Yet, the ability of medical LLMs to generate informative follow-up questions and thus reason over differential diagnoses remains underexplored. Here, we introduce MedClarify, an AI agent for information-seeking that can generate follow-up questions for iterative reasoning to support diagnostic decision-making. Specifically, MedClarify computes a list of candidate diagnoses analogous to a differential diagnosis, and then proactively generates follow-up questions aimed at reducing diagnostic uncertainty. By selecting the question with the highest expected information gain, MedClarify enables targeted, uncertainty-aware reasoning to improve diagnostic performance. In our experiments, we first demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in medical reasoning, which often yield multiple, similarly likely diagnoses, especially when patient cases are incomplete or relevant information for diagnosis is missing. We then show that our information-theoretic reasoning approach can generate effective follow-up questioning and thereby reduces diagnostic errors by ~27 percentage points (p.p.) compared to a standard single-shot LLM baseline. Altogether, MedClarify offers a path to improve medical LLMs through agentic information-seeking and to thus promote effective dialogues with medical LLMs that reflect the iterative and uncertain nature of real-world clinical reasoning.'}

Taking a first step towards this vision, we introduce the AI GameStore, a scalable and open-ended platform that uses LLMs with humans-in-the-loop to synthesize new representative human games, by automatically sourcing and adapting standardized and containerized variants of game environments from popular human digital gaming platforms. As a proof of concept, we generated 100 such games based on the top charts of Apple App Store and Steam, and evaluated seven frontier vision-language models (VLMs) on short episodes of play.

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning, they often struggle to generate consistent, individual-specific behavior, particularly when accurate prediction depends on complex interactions between psychological traits and situational constraints. Prompting-based approaches can be brittle in this setting, exhibiting identity drift and limited ability to leverage increasingly detailed persona descriptions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Large Behavioral Model (LBM), a behavioral foundation model fine-tuned to predict individual strategic choices with high fidelity. LBM shifts from transient persona prompting to behavioral embedding by conditioning on a structured, high-dimensional trait profile derived from a comprehensive psychometric battery. Trained on a proprietary dataset linking stable dispositions, motivational states, and situational constraints to observed choices, LBM learns to map rich psychological profiles to discrete actions across diverse strategic dilemmas. In a held-out scenario evaluation, LBM fine-tuning improves behavioral prediction relative to the unadapted Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone and performs comparably to frontier baselines when conditioned on Big Five traits. Moreover, we find that while prompting-based baselines exhibit a complexity ceiling, LBM continues to benefit from increasingly dense trait profiles, with performance improving as additional trait dimensions are provided. Together, these results establish LBM as a scalable approach for high-fidelity behavioral simulation, enabling applications in strategic foresight, negotiation analysis, cognitive security, and decision support.'}

In this paper, we propose Phantom, an automated agent hijacking framework built upon Structured Template Injection that targets the fundamental architectural mechanisms of LLM agents. Our key insight is that agents rely on specific chat template tokens to separate system, user, assistant, and tool instructions. By injecting optimized structured templates into the retrieved context, we induce role confusion and cause the agent to misinterpret the injected content as legitimate user instructions or prior tool outputs. To enhance attack transferability against black-box agents, Phantom introduces a novel attack template search framework. We first perform multi-level template augmentation to increase structural diversity and then train a Template Autoencoder (TAE) to embed discrete templates into a continuous, searchable latent space. Subsequently, we apply Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal adversarial vectors that are decoded into high-potency structured templates. Extensive experiments on Qwen, GPT, and Gemini demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in both Attack Success Rate (ASR) and query efficiency.

We introduce DeepContext, a stateful monitoring framework designed to map the temporal trajectory of user intent. DeepContext discards the isolated evaluation model in favor of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that ingests a sequence of fine-tuned turn-level embeddings. By propagating a hidden state across the conversation, DeepContext captures the incremental accumulation of risk that stateless models overlook. Our evaluation demonstrates that DeepContext significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-turn jailbreak detection, achieving a state-of-the-art F1 score of 0.84, which represents a substantial improvement over both hyperscaler cloud-provider guardrails and leading open-weight models such as Llama-Prompt-Guard-2 (0.67) and Granite-Guardian (0.67). Furthermore, DeepContext maintains a sub-20ms inference overhead on a T4 GPU, ensuring viability for real-time applications. These results suggest that modeling the sequential evolution of intent is a more effective and computationally efficient alternative to deploying massive, stateless models.'}

To identify factors driving saturation, we characterize benchmarks along 14 properties spanning task design, data construction, and evaluation format. We test five hypotheses examining how each property contributes to saturation rates. Our analysis reveals that nearly half of the benchmarks exhibit saturation, with rates increasing as benchmarks age. Notably, hiding test data (i.e., public vs. private) shows no protective effect, while expert-curated benchmarks resist saturation better than crowdsourced ones.

Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verification can establish trust but is resource-intensive, while weak verification is fast and scalable but noisy and imperfect. We formalize this tension through weak--strong verification policies, which decide when to accept or reject based on weak verification and when to defer to strong verification. We introduce metrics capturing incorrect acceptance, incorrect rejection, and strong-verification frequency. Over population, we show that optimal policies admit a two-threshold structure and that calibration and sharpness govern the value of weak verifiers. Building on this, we develop an online algorithm that provably controls acceptance and rejection errors without assumptions on the query stream, the language model, or the weak verifier.'}

We formalize several families of consistency-based black-box scorers, providing generalizations and extensions of existing methods. In our experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets, we find 1) claim-response entailment consistently performs better or on par with more complex claim-level scorers, 2) claim-level scoring generally yields better results than sentence-level scoring, and 3) uncertainty-aware decoding is highly effective for improving the factuality of long-form outputs.

In such scenarios, voice radio communications remain essential for first responders due to their robustness; however, their unstructured nature prevents direct integration with automated UAV-assisted network management. This paper proposes SIREN, an AI-driven framework that enables voice-driven perception for UAV-assisted networks. By integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based semantic extraction and Natural Language Processing (NLP) validation, SIREN converts emergency voice traffic into structured, machine-readable information, including responding units, location references, emergency severity, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. SIREN is evaluated using synthetic emergency scenarios with controlled variations in language, speaker count, background noise, and message complexity. The results demonstrate robust transcription and reliable semantic extraction across diverse operating conditions, while highlighting speaker diarization and geographic ambiguity as the main limiting factors. These findings establish the feasibility of voice-driven situational awareness for UAV-assisted networks and show a practical foundation for human-in-the-loop decision support and adaptive network management in emergency response operations.'}

Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.'}

Wong', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17095', 'abstract': 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enable large language models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks efficiently. Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data. However, the use of two separate low-rank matrices in LoRA for federated fine-tuning introduces two types of challenges. The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.'}

While foundational families like Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) rest on solid theoretical ground, the design of their most effective variants often relies on human intuition to navigate a vast algorithmic design space. In this work, we propose the use of AlphaEvolve, an evolutionary coding agent powered by large language models, to automatically discover new multiagent learning algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by evolving novel variants for two distinct paradigms of game-theoretic learning. First, in the domain of iterative regret minimization, we evolve the logic governing regret accumulation and policy derivation, discovering a new algorithm, Volatility-Adaptive Discounted (VAD-)CFR. VAD-CFR employs novel, non-intuitive mechanisms-including volatility-sensitive discounting, consistency-enforced optimism, and a hard warm-start policy accumulation schedule-to outperform state-of-the-art baselines like Discounted Predictive CFR+. Second, in the regime of population based training algorithms, we evolve training-time and evaluation-time meta strategy solvers for PSRO, discovering a new variant, Smoothed Hybrid Optimistic Regret (SHOR-)PSRO. SHOR-PSRO introduces a hybrid meta-solver that linearly blends Optimistic Regret Matching with a smoothed, temperature-controlled distribution over best pure strategies. By dynamically annealing this blending factor and diversity bonuses during training, the algorithm automates the transition from population diversity to rigorous equilibrium finding, yielding superior empirical convergence compared to standard static meta-solvers.'}

However, these agents are prone to a wide range of misbehaviors, such as deviating from the user's instructions, getting stuck in repetitive loops, or failing to use tools correctly. These failures disrupt the development workflow and often require resource-intensive manual intervention. In this paper, we present a system for automatically recovering from agentic misbehaviors at scale. We first introduce a taxonomy of misbehaviors grounded in an analysis of production traffic, identifying three primary categories: Specification Drift, Reasoning Problems, and Tool Call Failures, which we find occur in about 30% of all agent trajectories.\nTo address these issues, we developed a lightweight, asynchronous self-intervention system named Wink. Wink observes agent trajectories and provides targeted course-correction guidance to nudge the agent back to a productive path. We evaluated our system on over 10,000 real world agent trajectories and found that it successfully resolves 90% of the misbehaviors that require a single intervention. Furthermore, a live A/B test in our production environment demonstrated that our system leads to a statistically significant reduction in Tool Call Failures, Tokens per Session and Engineer Interventions per Session. We present our experience designing and deploying this system, offering insights into the challenges of building resilient agentic systems at scale."}

With full Internet access, our agent can re-identify Hacker News users and Anthropic Interviewer participants at high precision, given pseudonymous online profiles and conversations alone, matching what would take hours for a dedicated human investigator. We then design attacks for the closed-world setting. Given two databases of pseudonymous individuals, each containing unstructured text written by or about that individual, we implement a scalable attack pipeline that uses LLMs to: (1) extract identity-relevant features, (2) search for candidate matches via semantic embeddings, and (3) reason over top candidates to verify matches and reduce false positives. Compared to prior deanonymization work (e.g., on the Netflix prize) that required structured data or manual feature engineering, our approach works directly on raw user content across arbitrary platforms. We construct three datasets with known ground-truth data to evaluate our attacks. The first links Hacker News to LinkedIn profiles, using cross-platform references that appear in the profiles. Our second dataset matches users across Reddit movie discussion communities; and the third splits a single user's Reddit history in time to create two pseudonymous profiles to be matched. In each setting, LLM-based methods substantially outperform classical baselines, achieving up to 68% recall at 90% precision compared to near 0% for the best non-LLM method.

Prior work shows that adversarial prompt manipulation can degrade large language model (LLM) performance in code generation. We test whether similar comment-based manipulation misleads LLMs during vulnerability detection. We build a 100-sample benchmark across Python, JavaScript, and Java, each paired with eight comment variants ranging from no comments to adversarial strategies such as authority spoofing and technical deception. Eight frontier models, five commercial and three open-source, are evaluated in 9,366 trials. Adversarial comments produce small, statistically non-significant effects on detection accuracy (McNemar exact p > 0.21; all 95 percent confidence intervals include zero). This holds for commercial models with 89 to 96 percent baseline detection and open-source models with 53 to 72 percent, despite large absolute performance gaps. Unlike generation settings where comment manipulation achieves high attack success, detection performance does not meaningfully degrade. More complex adversarial strategies offer no advantage over simple manipulative comments. We test four automated defenses across 4,646 additional trials (14,012 total). Static analysis cross-referencing performs best at 96.9 percent detection and recovers 47 percent of baseline misses. Comment stripping reduces detection for weaker models by removing helpful context. Failures concentrate on inherently difficult vulnerability classes, including race conditions, timing side channels, and complex authorization logic, rather than on adversarial comments.'}

To address this, we propose APEX-SQL, an Agentic Text-to-SQL Framework that shifts the paradigm from passive translation to agentic exploration. Our framework employs a hypothesis-verification loop to ground model reasoning in real data. In the schema linking phase, we use logical planning to verbalize hypotheses, dual-pathway pruning to reduce the search space, and parallel data profiling to validate column roles against real data, followed by global synthesis to ensure topological connectivity. For SQL generation, we introduce a deterministic mechanism to retrieve exploration directives, allowing the agent to effectively explore data distributions, refine hypotheses, and generate semantically accurate SQLs. Experiments on BIRD (70.65% execution accuracy) and Spider 2.0-Snow (51.01% execution accuracy) demonstrate that APEX-SQL outperforms competitive baselines with reduced token consumption. Further analysis reveals that agentic exploration acts as a performance multiplier, unlocking the latent reasoning potential of foundation models in enterprise settings. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of each component in ensuring robust and accurate data analysis.'}
