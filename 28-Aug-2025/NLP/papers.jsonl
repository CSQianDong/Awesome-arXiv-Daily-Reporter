While recent MLLM advancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for human-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to our work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic standardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained expert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process, enabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive experiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs exhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap compared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that cognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity. However, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas human correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern complexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations in current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable insights for advancing model design."}

New attacks expose LLMs' inability to recognize unseen malicious instructions, highlighting a critical distributional mismatch between training data and real-world attacks that forces developers into reactive patching cycles. To tackle this challenge, we propose IMAGINE, a synthesis framework that leverages embedding space distribution analysis to generate jailbreak-like instructions. This approach effectively fills the distributional gap between authentic jailbreak patterns and safety alignment corpora. IMAGINE follows an iterative optimization process that dynamically evolves text generation distributions across iterations, thereby augmenting the coverage of safety alignment data distributions through synthesized data examples. Based on the safety-aligned corpus enhanced through IMAGINE, our framework demonstrates significant decreases in attack success rate on Qwen2.5, Llama3.1, and Llama3.2 without compromising their utility."}

Benchmark datasets in this area often exhibit a long-tail label distribution, where many labels are underrepresented, leading to poor model performance on rare classes. This paper proposes Selective Retrieval-Augmentation (SRA) as a solution to this problem. SRA focuses on augmenting samples belonging to low-frequency labels in the training set, preventing the introduction of noise for well-represented classes, and requires no changes to the model architecture. Retrieval is performed only from the training data to ensure there is no potential information leakage, removing the need for external corpora simultaneously. The proposed SRA method is tested on two legal text classification benchmark datasets with long-tail distributions: LEDGAR (single-label) and UNFAIR-ToS (multi-label). The results indicate that SRA attains higher micro-F1 and macro-F1 scores compared to all current LexGLUE baselines across both datasets, illustrating consistent improvements in long-tail legal text classification.

In this context, we propose ReSURE (Regularizing Supervision UnREliability), an adaptive learning method that dynamically down-weights unreliable supervision without explicit filtering. ReSURE estimates per-turn loss distributions using Welford's online statistics and reweights sample losses on the fly accordingly. Experiments on both single-source and mixed-quality datasets show improved stability and response quality. Notably, ReSURE enjoys positive Spearman correlations (0.21 ~ 1.0 across multiple benchmarks) between response scores and number of samples regardless of data quality, which potentially paves the way for utilizing large-scale data effectively.

To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware LLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and maps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student conversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from the conversational text as well as from their facial expressions.

However, current compositional benchmarks testing these skills tend to focus on either commonsense or math reasoning, whereas LLM agents solving real-world tasks would require a combination of both. In this work, we introduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each compositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning step. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training strategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet their accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a substantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior compositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning type. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional questions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better understand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and membership inference. Our work underscores a substantial degree of model brittleness in the context of mixed-type compositional reasoning and offers a test bed for future improvement.'}

However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques.

Previous studies have focused on biases inherited from training data, but whether stereotypes can emerge spontaneously in AI agent interactions merits further exploration. Through a novel experimental framework simulating workplace interactions with neutral initial conditions, we investigate the emergence and evolution of stereotypes in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Our findings reveal that (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their interactions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype effects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power, particularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems exhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo effects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype patterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures. Through comprehensive quantitative analysis, these findings suggest that stereotype formation in AI systems may arise as an emergent property of multi-agent interactions, rather than merely from training data biases.

We present a set of Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) for deductive reasoning. To train the ORMs we mainly generate data using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with single and multiple samples. Additionally, we propose a novel tactic to further expand the type of errors covered in the training dataset of the ORM. In particular, we propose an echo generation technique that leverages LLMs' tendency to reflect incorrect assumptions made in prompts to extract additional training data, covering previously unexplored error types. While a standard CoT chain may contain errors likely to be made by the reasoner, the echo strategy deliberately steers the model toward incorrect reasoning. We show that ORMs trained on CoT and echo-augmented data demonstrate improved performance on the FOLIO, JustLogic, and ProverQA datasets across four different LLMs."}

To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class evaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately 500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL classifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel classifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection followed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of prompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both LLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed by SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data, supplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for mitigating harmful language in medical curricula."}

We then evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across 27 tasks with respect to these desiderata. We find that expert personas usually lead to positive or non-significant performance changes. Surprisingly, models are highly sensitive to irrelevant persona details, with performance drops of almost 30 percentage points.

Existing methods use random linear hashing to identify important tokens, but this approach is inefficient due to the orthogonal distribution of queries and keys within two narrow cones in LLMs. We introduce Spotlight Attention, a novel method that employs non-linear hashing functions to optimize the embedding distribution of queries and keys, enhancing coding efficiency and robustness. We also developed a lightweight, stable training framework using a Bradley-Terry ranking-based loss, enabling optimization of the non-linear hashing module on GPUs with 16GB memory in 8 hours. Experimental results show that Spotlight Attention drastically improves retrieval precision while shortening the length of the hash code at least 5$\\times$ compared to traditional linear hashing. Finally, we exploit the computational advantages of bitwise operations by implementing specialized CUDA kernels, achieving hashing retrieval for 512K tokens in under 100$\\mu$s on a single A100 GPU, with end-to-end throughput up to 3$\\times$ higher than vanilla decoding.'}

Small vision-language models (sVLMs) such as ViLT, VisualBERT and FLAVA therefore lag behind their larger generative counterparts. To study the effect of careful commonsense knowledge integration on sVLMs, we present an end-to-end framework (NLKI) that (i) retrieves natural language facts, (ii) prompts an LLM to craft natural language explanations, and (iii) feeds both signals to sVLMs respectively across two commonsense VQA datasets (CRIC, AOKVQA) and a visual-entailment dataset (e-SNLI-VE). Facts retrieved using a fine-tuned ColBERTv2 and an object information-enriched prompt yield explanations that largely cut down hallucinations, while lifting the end-to-end answer accuracy by up to 7% (across 3 datasets), making FLAVA and other models in NLKI match or exceed medium-sized VLMs such as Qwen-2 VL-2B and SmolVLM-2.5B. As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional finetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and generalised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our findings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from commonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models in the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient commonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models.'}

Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and editing context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual knowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large models, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust LLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these problems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a simple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge continuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e. proxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the original distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the evaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics to measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real conflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity and reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

Previous detection methods, including fine-tuned small models or LLM-based detectors, often struggle with its dynamically evolving nature. In this work, we propose a novel framework called the Symbolic Adversarial Learning Framework (SALF), which implements an adversarial training paradigm by an agent symbolic learning optimization process, rather than relying on numerical updates. SALF introduces a paradigm where the generation agent crafts deceptive narratives, and the detection agent uses structured debates to identify logical and factual flaws for detection, and they iteratively refine themselves through such adversarial interactions. Unlike traditional neural updates, we represent agents using agent symbolic learning, where learnable weights are defined by agent prompts, and simulate back-propagation and gradient descent by operating on natural language representations of weights, loss, and gradients. Experiments on two multilingual benchmark datasets demonstrate SALF's effectiveness, showing it generates sophisticated fake news that degrades state-of-the-art detection performance by up to 53.4% in Chinese and 34.2% in English on average.

Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in practice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how LLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on noise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within the LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate layers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper layers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this insight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that directly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer decoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge. To identify the optimal intermediate layer, we introduce an internal knowledge score (IKS) criterion that selects the layer with the lowest IKS value in the latter half of layers.

Recogniser systems must therefore rely solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%.

First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk.

We propose Blockwise SFT, which partitions responses into fixed-size blocks, selects one active block per step for stochastic masking, freezes all preceding tokens, and fully hides future ones. Loss is computed only over the active block, directly mirroring the blockwise decoding process. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and MetaMathQA show consistent gains over classical SFT under equal compute or token budgets.

Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work, we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes, anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%) with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance.

Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

In VA, interviewers ask proximal informants for details on the circumstances preceding a death, in the form of unstructured narratives and structured questions. Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms only use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this thesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD classification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning (ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that with the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning outperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and population levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We explore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions in unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD classification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may capture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also characterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe variations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that classification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and models. Overall, this thesis advances the growing body of knowledge at the intersection of natural language processing, epidemiology, and global health. It demonstrates the value of narrative in enhancing COD classification. Our findings underscore the need for more high-quality data from more diverse settings to use in training and fine-tuning PLM/ML methods, and offer valuable insights to guide the rethinking and redesign of the VA instrument and interview.'}

However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics.

Prior work demonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into generating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base. However, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong \\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false context once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for attackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.\nIn contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the knowledge base, we introduce \\textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that compromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce attacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to straightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the generator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a contrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and stealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for specific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further strengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that automatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based defenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA benchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions, which successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\\% under diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy under several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for retriever-centric defenses.'}

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii) layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2 sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v) reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach.

With the advent of large language models (LLMs), these tensions are now mediated by algorithmic systems whose training data and design choices may themselves embed cultural or ideological biases. This study investigates geopolitical parallax-systematic divergence in news quality and subjectivity assessments-by comparing article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen, BGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families. We evaluate both on a human-annotated news quality benchmark spanning fifteen stylistic, informational, and affective dimensions, and on parallel corpora covering politically sensitive topics, including Palestine and reciprocal China-United States coverage. Using logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation, we quantify per-metric differences in predicted positive-class probabilities between model families. Our findings reveal consistent, non-random divergences aligned with model origin. In Palestine-related coverage, Western models assign higher subjectivity and positive emotion scores, while Chinese models emphasize novelty and descriptiveness. Cross-topic analysis shows asymmetries in structural quality metrics Chinese-on-US scoring notably lower in fluency, conciseness, technicality, and overall quality-contrasted by higher negative emotion scores. These patterns align with media bias theory and our distinction between semantic, emotional, and relational subjectivity, and extend LLM bias literature by showing that geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream quality assessment tasks. We conclude that LLM-based media evaluation pipelines require cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with model-induced bias.'}

In practice, users often pose multiple questions in a single conversation with LLMs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Group Query Attack, a technique that simulates this scenario by presenting groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously. We investigate how the accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences the outputs of LLMs. Specifically, we observe that Group Query Attack significantly degrades the performance of models fine-tuned on specific tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Group Query Attack induces a risk of triggering potential backdoors of LLMs. Besides, Group Query Attack is also effective in tasks involving reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation for pre-trained and aligned models.'}

We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.'}

This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future."}

Exploring WEIRDness and Human Rights in Large Language Models', 'authors': 'Ke Zhou, Marios Constantinides, Daniele Quercia', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19269', 'abstract': "Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on data that reflect WEIRD values: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. This raises concerns about cultural bias and fairness. Using responses to the World Values Survey, we evaluated five widely used LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, BLOOM, and Qwen. We measured how closely these responses aligned with the values of the WEIRD countries and whether they conflicted with human rights principles. To reflect global diversity, we compared the results with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and three regional charters from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM and Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more likely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding gender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a man who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should always know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms. These findings suggest that as cultural representation in LLMs increases, so does the risk of reproducing discriminatory beliefs. Approaches such as Constitutional AI, which could embed human rights principles into model behavior, may only partly help resolve this tension."}

{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2508.19259', 'title': 'Capabilities of GPT-5 across critical domains: Is it the next breakthrough?', 'authors': 'Georgios P. Georgiou', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19259', 'abstract': 'The accelerated evolution of large language models has raised questions about their comparative performance across domains of practical importance. GPT-4 by OpenAI introduced advances in reasoning, multimodality, and task generalization, establishing itself as a valuable tool in education, clinical diagnosis, and academic writing, though it was accompanied by several flaws. Released in August 2025, GPT-5 incorporates a system-of-models architecture designed for task-specific optimization and, based on both anecdotal accounts and emerging evidence from the literature, demonstrates stronger performance than its predecessor in medical contexts. This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons of GPT-4 and GPT-5 using human raters from linguistics and clinical fields. Twenty experts evaluated model-generated outputs across five domains: lesson planning, assignment evaluation, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, based on predefined criteria. Mixed-effects models revealed that GPT-5 significantly outperformed GPT-4 in lesson planning, clinical diagnosis, research generation, and ethical reasoning, while both models performed comparably in assignment assessment. The findings highlight the potential of GPT-5 to serve as a context-sensitive and domain-specialized tool, offering tangible benefits for education, clinical practice, and academic research, while also advancing ethical reasoning. These results contribute to one of the earliest empirical evaluations of the evolving capabilities and practical promise of GPT-5.'}
