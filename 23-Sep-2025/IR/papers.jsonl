However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.'}

From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.\nIn this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\\%$ increase in advertising revenue.'}

The performance of a given algorithm depends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and constraints.

This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To address this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published literature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct approaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with data-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a commercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a series of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy and reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better than the commercial LLM chatbot.'}

This work presents the first systematic comparison between LLM-simulated users and human users in personalized task-oriented conversations. We propose a comprehensive analytical framework encompassing three key aspects (conversation strategy, interaction style, and conversation evaluation) and ten distinct dimensions for evaluating user behaviors, and collect parallel conversational datasets from both human users and LLM agent users across four representative scenarios under identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant behavioral differences between the two user types in problem-solving approaches, question broadness, user engagement, context dependency, feedback polarity and promise, language style, and hallucination awareness. We found consistency in the agent users and human users across the depth-first or breadth-first dimensions, as well as the usefulness dimensions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing LLM-based user simulation. Our multi-dimensional taxonomy constructed a generalizable framework for analyzing user behavior patterns, offering insights from LLM agent users and human users.

However, the nature and necessity of information retrieval in real-world conversations remain largely unexplored, as research has focused predominantly on traditional, explicit information access conversations. The central question is: What do real-world information access conversations look like? To this end, we first conduct an observational study on the WildChat dataset, large-scale user-ChatGPT conversations, finding that users' access to information occurs implicitly as check-worthy factual assertions made by the system, even when the conversation's primary intent is non-informational, such as creative writing. To enable the systematic study of this phenomenon, we release the WildClaims dataset, a novel resource consisting of 121,905 extracted factual claims from 7,587 utterances in 3,000 WildChat conversations, each annotated for check-worthiness. Our preliminary analysis of this resource reveals that conservatively 18% to 51% of conversations contain check-worthy assertions, depending on the methods employed, and less conservatively, as many as 76% may contain such assertions. This high prevalence underscores the importance of moving beyond the traditional understanding of explicit information access, to address the implicit information access that arises in real-world user-system conversations."}

Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph (GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users' evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data.

We seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream" vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.'}

We investigate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and hierarchical knowledge structures.

We then compare the standard embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure. We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger context windows.

A recent work on learning SPLADE models with expanded vocabularies (ESPLADE) was proposed to represent queries and documents into a sparse space of custom vocabulary which have different levels of vocabularic granularity. Within this effort, however, there have not been many studies on the role of vocabulary in SPLADE models and their relationship to retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.\nTo study this, we construct BERT models with 100K-sized output vocabularies, one initialized with the ESPLADE pretraining method and one initialized randomly. After finetune on real-world search click logs, we applied logit score-based queries and documents pruning to max size for further balancing efficiency. The experimental result in our evaluation set shows that, when pruning is applied, the two models are effective compared to the 32K-sized normal SPLADE model in the computational budget under the BM25. And the ESPLADE models are more effective than the random vocab model, while having a similar retrieval cost.\nThe result indicates that the size and pretrained weight of output vocabularies play the role of configuring the representational specification for queries, documents, and their interactions in the retrieval engine, beyond their original meaning and purposes in NLP. These findings can provide a new room for improvement for LSR by identifying the importance of representational specification from vocabulary configuration for efficient and effective retrieval.'}

We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding dimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number of documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a standard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and document pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon, where retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy. To address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly improves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer documents. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving documents at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune boosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%.

Without information retrieval techniques, this task is impossible due to the vast and expanding literature. Objective: Building on prior work, this study evaluates an information retrieval-driven workflow to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility of systematic reviews. We use endometriosis recurrence as an ideal case due to its complex and ambiguous literature. Methods: Our hybrid approach integrates PRISMA guidelines with computational techniques. We applied semi-automated deduplication to efficiently filter records before manual screening. This workflow synthesized evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of a subclass of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH'as). A modified splitting method addressed unit-of-analysis errors in multi-arm trials. Results: Our workflow efficiently reduced the screening workload. It took only 11 days to fetch and filter 812 records. Seven RCTs were eligible, providing evidence from 841 patients in 4 countries. The pooled random-effects model yielded a Risk Ratio (RR) of 0.64 (95% CI (0.48 to 0.86)), with non-significant heterogeneity ($I^2=0.00\\%$, $\\tau=0.00$); i.e., a 36% reduction in endometriosis recurrence. Sensitivity analyses and bias assessments supported the robustness of our findings. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an information-retrieval-driven workflow for medical evidence synthesis. Our approach yields valuable clinical results while providing a framework for accelerating the systematic review process. It bridges the gap between clinical research and computer science and can be generalized to other complex systematic reviews."}

However, existing methods often fail to generalize to unseen users or locations and struggle to capture dynamic intent due to limited labeled data and the complexity of mobility patterns. We propose ZHMF, a framework for zero-shot human mobility forecasting that combines a semantic enhanced retrieval and reflection mechanism with a hierarchical language model based reasoning system. The task is reformulated as a natural language question answering paradigm. Leveraging LLMs semantic understanding of user histories and context, our approach handles previously unseen prediction scenarios. We further introduce a hierarchical reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning and refinement by decomposing forecasting into an activity level planner and a location level selector, enabling collaborative modeling of long term user intentions and short term contextual preferences. Experiments on standard human mobility datasets show that our approach outperforms existing models. Ablation studies reveal the contribution of each module, and case studies illustrate how the method captures user intentions and adapts to diverse contextual scenarios.'}

In this work, we present a large-scale comparative study of state-of-the-art transformer versus Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based models to classify mental health posts into exclusive categories of mental health conditions. We first curate a large dataset of Reddit posts spanning six mental health conditions and a control group, using rigorous filtering and statistical exploratory analysis to ensure annotation quality. We then evaluate five transformer architectures (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against several LSTM variants (with or without attention, using contextual or static embeddings) under identical conditions. Experimental results show that transformer models consistently outperform the alternatives, with RoBERTa achieving 91-99% F1-scores and accuracies across all classes. Notably, attention-augmented LSTMs with BERT embeddings approach transformer performance (up to 97% F1-score) while training 2-3.5 times faster, whereas LSTMs using static embeddings fail to learn useful signals. These findings represent the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class mental health detection, offering practical guidance on model selection and highlighting an accuracy-efficiency trade-off for real-world deployment of mental health NLP systems.'}

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, due to its unique architectural designs in consensus mechanisms, resource management, and throughput, TRON has developed a more distinctive ecosystem and application scenarios centered around stablecoins. Although it is popular in areas like stablecoin payments and settlement, research on analyzing on-chain data from the TRON blockchain is remarkably scarce. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive data extraction and exploration framework for the TRON blockchain. An innovative high-performance ETL system aims to efficiently extract raw on-chain data from TRON, including blocks, transactions, smart contracts, and receipts, establishing a research dataset. An in-depth analysis of the extracted dataset reveals insights into TRON's block generation, transaction trends, the dominance of exchanges, the resource delegation market, smart contract usage patterns, and the central role of the USDT stablecoin. The prominence of gambling applications and potential illicit activities related to USDT is emphasized. The paper discusses opportunities for future research leveraging this dataset, including analysis of delegate services, gambling scenarios, stablecoin activities, and illicit transaction detection. These contributions enhance blockchain data management capabilities and understanding of the rapidly evolving TRON ecosystem."}
