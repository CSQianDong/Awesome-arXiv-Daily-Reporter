While existing benchmarks have effectively identified social biases in LLMs, a critical gap remains in our understanding of the underlying reasoning that leads to these biased outputs. This paper goes one step further to evaluate the causal reasoning process of LLMs when they answer questions eliciting social biases. We first propose a novel conceptual framework to classify the causal reasoning produced by LLMs. Next, we use LLMs to synthesize $1788$ questions covering $8$ sensitive attributes and manually validate them. The questions can test different kinds of causal reasoning by letting LLMs disclose their reasoning process with causal graphs. We then test 4 state-of-the-art LLMs. All models answer the majority of questions with biased causal reasoning, resulting in a total of $4135$ biased causal graphs. Meanwhile, we discover $3$ strategies for LLMs to avoid biased causal reasoning by analyzing the "bias-free" cases. Finally, we reveal that LLMs are also prone to "mistaken-biased" causal reasoning, where they first confuse correlation with causality to infer specific sensitive group names and then incorporate biased causal reasoning.'}
