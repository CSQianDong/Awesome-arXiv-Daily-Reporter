**Abstract**: In medical scenarios, effectively retrieving external knowledge and leveraging it for rigorous logical reasoning is of significant importance. Despite their potential, existing work has predominantly focused on enhancing either retrieval or reasoning capabilities of the models in isolation, with little attention given to their joint optimization, which leads to limited coordination between the two processes. Additionally, current methods rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which can cause models to memorize existing problem-solving pathways, thereby restricting their generalization ability when confronted with novel problem contexts. Furthermore, while some studies have explored to improve retrieval-augmented reasoning in general domains via reinforcement learning, their reward function designs do not adequately capture the specific demands of the medical domain. To address these challenges, we introduce **Med-R$^3$**, a **Med**ical **R**etrieval-augmented **R**easoning framework driven by progressive **R**einforcement learning. In this framework, we first develop the model's ability to perform logical reasoning over medical problems. Subsequently, on the basis of this foundation, we adaptively optimize the retrieval capability to better align with the characteristics of knowledge corpus and external information utilization throughout the reasoning process. Finally, we conduct joint optimization of the model's retrieval and reasoning coordination. Extensive experiments indicate that **Med-R$^3$** could achieve state-of-the-art performances, with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct + Med-R$^3$ surpassing closed-sourced GPT-4o-mini by 3.93\% at a comparable parameter scale, while Qwen2.5-14B augmented with Med-R$^3$ shows a more substantial gain of 13.53\%.

**Abstract**: Critical thinking is essential for building robust AI systems, preventing them from blindly accepting flawed data or biased reasoning. However, prior work has primarily focused on passive critical thinking, where models simply reject problematic queries without taking constructive steps to address user requests. In this work, we introduce proactive critical thinking, a paradigm where models actively seek missing or clarifying information from users to resolve their queries better. To evaluate this capability, we present GSM-MC and GSM-MCE, two novel benchmarks based on GSM8K for assessing mathematical reasoning under incomplete or misleading conditions. GSM-MC contains 1,368 math problems with a key variable deliberately removed, requiring models to identify and request the missing information. GSM-MCE further increases the difficulty by introducing irrelevant details to test robustness against distractions. Experiments on Qwen3 and Llama series models show that, while these models excel in traditional reasoning tasks due to extensive post-training and inference-time scaling, they struggle with proactive critical thinking, especially smaller ones. However, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can significantly improve this ability. Using our enhanced RL algorithm, we achieve substantial gains, boosting the Qwen3-1.7B's accuracy from 0.15% to 73.98% on GSM-MC. We hope this work advances models that collaborate more effectively with users in problem-solving through proactive critical thinking.

# Trustworthy Reasoning: Evaluating and Enhancing Factual Accuracy in LLM Intermediate Thought Processes

**Abstract**: We present RELIANCE (Reasoning Evaluation with Logical Integrity and Accuracy for Confidence Enhancement), a novel framework addressing a critical vulnerability in Large Language Models (LLMs): the prevalence of factual inaccuracies within intermediate reasoning steps despite correct final answers. This phenomenon poses substantial risks in high-stakes domains including healthcare, legal analysis, and scientific research, where erroneous yet confidently presented reasoning can mislead users into dangerous decisions. Our framework integrates three core components: (1) a specialized fact-checking classifier trained on counterfactually augmented data to detect subtle factual inconsistencies within reasoning chains; (2) a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning approach that balances factuality, coherence, and structural correctness through multi-dimensional rewards; and (3) a mechanistic interpretability module examining how factuality improvements manifest in model activations during reasoning processes. Extensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art models reveals concerning patterns: even leading models like Claude-3.7 and GPT-o1 demonstrate reasoning factual accuracy of only 81.93% and 82.57% respectively. RELIANCE significantly enhances factual robustness (up to 49.90% improvement) while maintaining or improving performance on challenging benchmarks including Math-500, AIME-2024, and GPQA. Furthermore, our activation-level analysis provides actionable insights into how factual enhancements reshape reasoning trajectories within model architectures, establishing foundations for future training methodologies that explicitly target factual robustness through activation-guided optimization.

**Abstract**: LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves $78.1\%$ of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.

# FairReason: Balancing Reasoning and Social Bias in MLLMs 

**Authors**: Zhenyu Pan, Yutong Zhang, Jianshu Zhang, Haoran Lu, Haozheng Luo, Yuwei Han, Philip S. Yu, Manling Li, Han Liu

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) already achieve state-of-the-art results across a wide range of tasks and modalities. To push their reasoning ability further, recent studies explore advanced prompting schemes and post-training fine-tuning. Although these techniques improve logical accuracy, they frequently leave the models' outputs burdened with pronounced social biases. Clarifying how reasoning gains interact with bias mitigation-and whether the two objectives inherently trade off-therefore remains an open and pressing research problem. Our study begins by benchmarking three bias-mitigation strategies-supervised fine-uning (SFT), knowledge distillation (KD), and rule-based reinforcement learning (RL)-under identical conditions, establishing their baseline strengths and weaknesses. Building on these results, we vary the proportion of debias-focused and reasoning-centric samples within each paradigm to chart the reasoning-versus-bias trade-off. Our sweeps reveal a consistent sweet spot: a roughly 1:4 mix trained with reinforcement learning cuts stereotype scores by 10% while retaining 88% of the model's original reasoning accuracy, offering concrete guidance for balancing fairness and capability in MLLMs.
