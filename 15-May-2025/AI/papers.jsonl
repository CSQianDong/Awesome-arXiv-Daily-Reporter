Richards, Rob Fergus, Kenneth Marino', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09614', 'abstract': 'Language model (LM) agents are increasingly used as autonomous decision-makers who need to actively gather information to guide their decisions. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs\' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established "Blicket Test" paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This "disjunctive bias" persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.'}

Critically, optimal policies for POMDPs may not be robust against perturbations in the environment. Hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs) capture sets of different environment models, that is, POMDPs with a shared action and observation space. The intuition is that the true model is hidden among a set of potential models, and it is unknown which model will be the environment at execution time. A policy is robust for a given HM-POMDP if it achieves sufficient performance for each of its POMDPs. We compute such robust policies by combining two orthogonal techniques: (1) a deductive formal verification technique that supports tractable robust policy evaluation by computing a worst-case POMDP within the HM-POMDP and (2) subgradient ascent to optimize the candidate policy for a worst-case POMDP. The empirical evaluation shows that, compared to various baselines, our approach (1) produces policies that are more robust and generalize better to unseen POMDPs and (2) scales to HM-POMDPs that consist of over a hundred thousand environments.'}

However, established methods for computing counterfactuals typically focus on one-step decision-making, and are not directly applicable to sequential decision-making tasks. This paper fills this gap by introducing counterfactual strategies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). During MDP execution, a strategy decides which of the enabled actions (with known probabilistic effects) to execute next. Given an initial strategy that reaches an undesired outcome with a probability above some limit, we identify minimal changes to the initial strategy to reduce that probability below the limit. We encode such counterfactual strategies as solutions to non-linear optimization problems, and further extend our encoding to synthesize diverse counterfactual strategies. We evaluate our approach on four real-world datasets and demonstrate its practical viability in sophisticated sequential decision-making tasks."}

However, this shift raises key questions about the extent to which LLM-based agents replicate human strategic reasoning, particularly in game-theoretic settings. In this context, we examine the role of agentic sophistication in shaping artificial reasoners' performance by evaluating three agent designs: a simple game-theoretic model, an unstructured LLM-as-agent model, and an LLM integrated into a traditional agentic framework. Using guessing games as a testbed, we benchmarked these agents against human participants across general reasoning patterns and individual role-based objectives. Furthermore, we introduced obfuscated game scenarios to assess agents' ability to generalise beyond training distributions. Our analysis, covering over 2000 reasoning samples across 25 agent configurations, shows that human-inspired cognitive structures can enhance LLM agents' alignment with human strategic behaviour. Still, the relationship between agentic design complexity and human-likeness is non-linear, highlighting a critical dependence on underlying LLM capabilities and suggesting limits to simple architectural augmentation."}

Since the same request can be either harmless or harmful depending on who made it and why, if the system makes decisions based solely on the request's content, it will refuse some legitimate queries and let pass harmful ones. To address this, we propose a conceptual access control framework, based on verified user credentials (such as institutional affiliation) and classifiers that assign model outputs to risk categories (such as advanced virology). The system permits responses only when the user's verified credentials match the category's requirements. For implementation of the model output classifiers, we introduce a theoretical approach utilizing small, gated expert modules integrated into the generator model, trained with gradient routing, that enable efficient risk detection without the capability gap problems of external monitors. While open questions remain about the verification mechanisms, risk categories, and the technical implementation, our framework makes the first step toward enabling granular governance of AI capabilities: verified users gain access to specialized knowledge without arbitrary restrictions, while adversaries are blocked from it. This contextual approach reconciles model utility with robust safety, addressing the dual-use dilemma."}

We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario using Japanese instructions, and explore an "inverse environment" where agents must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages, offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative tasks.

The objective is to identify effective Courses of Action that lead to mission success within preset simulations, thereby enabling the exploration of real-world defense scenarios at low cost and in a safe-to-fail setting. Applying deep Reinforcement Learning in this context poses specific challenges, such as complex flight dynamics, the exponential size of the state and action spaces in multi-agent systems, and the capability to integrate real-time control of individual units with look-ahead planning. To address these challenges, the decision-making process is split into two levels of abstraction: low-level policies control individual units, while a high-level commander policy issues macro commands aligned with the overall mission targets. This hierarchical structure facilitates the training process by exploiting policy symmetries of individual agents and by separating control from command tasks. The low-level policies are trained for individual combat control in a curriculum of increasing complexity. The high-level commander is then trained on mission targets given pre-trained control policies. The empirical validation confirms the advantages of the proposed framework.'}

However, in many real-world scenarios, rewards are not always observable, which can be modeled as a monitored Markov decision process (Mon-MDP). Prior work on Mon-MDPs have been limited to simple, tabular cases, restricting their applicability to real-world problems. This work explores Mon-MDPs using function approximation (FA) and investigates the challenges involved. We show that combining function approximation with a learned reward model enables agents to generalize from monitored states with observable rewards, to unmonitored environment states with unobservable rewards. Therefore, we demonstrate that such generalization with a reward model achieves near-optimal policies in environments formally defined as unsolvable. However, we identify a critical limitation of such function approximation, where agents incorrectly extrapolate rewards due to overgeneralization, resulting in undesirable behaviors. To mitigate overgeneralization, we propose a cautious police optimization method leveraging reward uncertainty. This work serves as a step towards bridging this gap between Mon-MDP theory and real-world applications."}

Additionally, having humans build a benchmark for every possible domain of interest is impractical. Therefore, we propose a methodology for automating the construction of fact-based synthetic data model evaluations grounded in document populations. This work leverages those very same LMs to evaluate domain-specific knowledge automatically, using only grounding documents (e.g., a textbook) as input. This synthetic data benchmarking approach corresponds well with human curated questions with a Spearman ranking correlation of 0.96 and a benchmark evaluation Pearson accuracy correlation of 0.79.

This reward function has been incorporated with two popular DRL algorithms, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft-Actor Critic (SAC), which can handle the continuous action space of acceleration/deceleration. The proposed models have been trained on the combination of real-world leader vehicle (LV) trajectories and simulated trajectories generated using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The overall performance of the proposed models has been tested using Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) plots and compared with the real-world trajectory data. The results show that the RL models successfully maintain lower distance headway (i.e., higher efficiency) and jerk compared to human-driven vehicles without compromising safety. Further, to assess the robustness of the proposed models, we evaluated the model performance on diverse safety-critical scenarios, in terms of car-following and traffic signal compliance. Both DDPG and SAC models successfully handled the critical scenarios, while the DDPG model showed smoother action profiles compared to the SAC model.

LLMs and their use in Verilog design has received significant attention due to the higher popularity of the language, but little attention so far has been given to VHDL despite its continued popularity in the industry.

We show how we developed test sets specific to our needs and used them for evaluating models as we performed extended pretraining (EPT) of a base LLM. Expert evaluation of the code explanations produced by the EPT model increased to 69% compared to a base model rating of 43%. We further show how we developed an LLM-as-a-judge to gauge models similar to expert evaluators. This led us to deriving and evaluating a host of new models, including an instruction-tuned version of the EPT model with an expected expert evaluator rating of 71%.

To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost.

While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.43 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset.

To address this, we introduce WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity (GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews.

Here, we address unreliability in multimodal models by proposing a Variational VQA approach. Specifically, instead of fine-tuning vision-language models by using AdamW, we employ a recently proposed variational algorithm called IVON, which yields a posterior distribution over model parameters. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach improves calibration and abstentions without sacrificing the accuracy of AdamW. For instance, compared to AdamW fine-tuning, we reduce Expected Calibration Error by more than 50% compared to the AdamW baseline and raise Coverage by 4% vs. SOTA (for a fixed risk of 1%). In the presence of distribution shifts, the performance gain is even higher, achieving 8% Coverage (@ 1% risk) improvement vs. SOTA when 50% of test cases are OOD.

As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost\'s concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships.

Yet, learning effective long-context policies from demonstrations remains challenging. As context length increases, training becomes increasingly expensive due to rising memory demands, and policy performance often degrades as a result of spurious correlations. Recent methods typically sidestep these issues by truncating context length, discarding historical information that may be critical for subsequent decisions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that explicitly regularizes the retention of past information. We first revisit the copycat problem in imitation learning and identify an opposite challenge in recent diffusion policies: rather than over-relying on prior actions, they often fail to capture essential dependencies between past and future actions. To address this, we introduce Past-Token Prediction (PTP), an auxiliary task in which the policy learns to predict past action tokens alongside future ones. This regularization significantly improves temporal modeling in the policy head, with minimal reliance on visual representations. Building on this observation, we further introduce a multistage training strategy: pre-train the visual encoder with short contexts, and fine-tune the policy head using cached long-context embeddings. This strategy preserves the benefits of PTP while greatly reducing memory and computational overhead. Finally, we extend PTP into a self-verification mechanism at test time, enabling the policy to score and select candidates consistent with past actions during inference. Experiments across four real-world and six simulated tasks demonstrate that our proposed method improves the performance of long-context diffusion policies by 3x and accelerates policy training by more than 10x.'}

ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 55.1$\\%$ to 91.5$\\%$.

Recent work has shown that deep linear networks tend to be resilient towards loss of plasticity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Adaptive Linearization (AdaLin), a general approach that dynamically adapts each neuron's activation function to mitigate plasticity loss. Unlike prior methods that rely on regularization or periodic resets, AdaLin equips every neuron with a learnable parameter and a gating mechanism that injects linearity into the activation function based on its gradient flow. This adaptive modulation ensures sufficient gradient signal and sustains continual learning without introducing additional hyperparameters or requiring explicit task boundaries. When used with conventional activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and GeLU, we demonstrate that AdaLin can significantly improve performance on standard benchmarks, including Random Label and Permuted MNIST, Random Label and Shuffled CIFAR-10, and Class-Split CIFAR-100. Furthermore, its efficacy is shown in more complex scenarios, such as class-incremental learning on CIFAR-100 with a ResNet-18 backbone, and in mitigating plasticity loss in off-policy reinforcement learning agents. We perform a systematic set of ablations that show that neuron-level adaptation is crucial for good performance and analyze a number of metrics in the network that might be correlated to loss of plasticity."}

UWB sensors measure inter-node distances to infer spatial relationships, aiding in resolving pose ambiguities and body shape variations when combined with anthropometric data. Unfortunately, IMUs are prone to drift, and UWB sensors are affected by body occlusions.

However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.'}

However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation. We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at this https URL.'}

Additionally, these models often produce inaccurate anomaly segmentation due to performing reconstruction in a low spatial resolution latent space. To enable reconstruction models enjoying high efficiency while enhancing their generalization for unified anomaly detection, we propose a simple yet effective method that reconstructs normal features and restores anomaly features with just One Normal Image Prompt (OneNIP). In contrast to previous work, OneNIP allows for the first time to reconstruct or restore anomalies with just one normal image prompt, effectively boosting unified anomaly detection performance. Furthermore, we propose a supervised refiner that regresses reconstruction errors by using both real normal and synthesized anomalous images, which significantly improves pixel-level anomaly segmentation.

To solve the problem, we propose a few-shot Anomaly-driven Generation (AnoGen) method, which guides the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies with only a few real anomalies, thereby benefiting training anomaly detection models. Specifically, our work is divided into three stages. In the first stage, we learn the anomaly distribution based on a few given real anomalies and inject the learned knowledge into an embedding. In the second stage, we use the embedding and given bounding boxes to guide the diffusion model to generate realistic and diverse anomalies on specific objects (or textures). In the final stage, we propose a weakly-supervised anomaly detection method to train a more powerful model with generated anomalies. Our method builds upon DRAEM and DesTSeg as the foundation model and conducts experiments on the commonly used industrial anomaly detection dataset, MVTec.

In this work, we propose a novel inverse material design generative framework called InvDesFlow-AL, which is based on active learning strategies. This framework can iteratively optimize the material generation process to gradually guide it towards desired performance characteristics. In terms of crystal structure prediction, the InvDesFlow-AL model achieves an RMSE of 0.0423 Å, representing an 32.96% improvement in performance compared to exsisting generative models. Additionally, InvDesFlow-AL has been successfully validated in the design of low-formation-energy and low-Ehull materials. It can systematically generate materials with progressively lower formation energies while continuously expanding the exploration across diverse chemical spaces. These results fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning-driven generative model in accelerating material discovery and inverse design. To further prove the effectiveness of this method, we took the search for BCS superconductors under ambient pressure as an example explored by InvDesFlow-AL.

We propose DRRNet, a four-stage architecture characterized by a "context-detail-fusion-refinement" pipeline to address these issues. Specifically, we introduce an Omni-Context Feature Extraction Module to capture global camouflage patterns and a Local Detail Extraction Module to supplement microstructural information for the full-scene context module. We then design a module for forming dual representations of scene understanding and structural awareness, which fuses panoramic features and local features across various scales. In the decoder, we also introduce a reverse refinement module that leverages spatial edge priors and frequency-domain noise suppression to perform a two-stage inverse refinement of the output. By applying two successive rounds of inverse refinement, the model effectively suppresses background interference and enhances the continuity of object boundaries.

The proposed algorithm, called Fair Clustering via Alignment (FCA), operates by alternately (i) finding a joint probability distribution to align the data from different protected groups, and (ii) optimizing cluster centers in the aligned space. A key advantage of FCA is that it theoretically guarantees approximately optimal clustering utility for any given fairness level without complex constraints, thereby enabling high-utility fair clustering in practice.

Our findings highlight instruction following and in-context learning as critical capabilities for TDD success, surpassing the importance of general coding proficiency or pretraining knowledge. Through comprehensive evaluation of 19 frontier models, we reveal performance bottlenecks, such as instruction loss in long prompts, and provide a detailed error analysis spanning multiple root causes. This work underscores the practical value of TDD-specific benchmarks and lays the foundation for advancing LLM capabilities in rigorous, application-driven coding scenarios.'}

Benjamin Erichson', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09022', 'abstract': "Mamba extends earlier state space models (SSMs) by introducing input-dependent dynamics, and has demonstrated strong empirical performance across a range of domains, including language modeling, computer vision, and foundation models. However, a surprising weakness remains: despite being built on architectures designed for long-range dependencies, Mamba performs poorly on long-range sequential tasks. Understanding and addressing this gap is important for improving Mamba's universality and versatility. In this work, we analyze Mamba's limitations through three perspectives: expressiveness, inductive bias, and training stability. Our theoretical results show how Mamba falls short in each of these aspects compared to earlier SSMs such as S4D. To address these issues, we propose $\\text{B}_2\\text{S}_6$, a simple extension of Mamba's S6 unit that combines block-wise selective dynamics with a channel-specific bias. We prove that these changes equip the model with a better-suited inductive bias and improve its expressiveness and stability. Empirically, $\\text{B}_2\\text{S}_6$ outperforms S4 and S4D on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks while maintaining Mamba's performance on language modeling benchmarks."}

Our analysis reveals that only 11,569 tokens are shared across all assemblies, while nearly 991,854 tokens are unique to a single genome, indicating a rapid decline in shared vocabulary with increasing assembly comparisons. Moreover, phylogenetic trees derived from token overlap failed to recapitulate established primate relationships, a discrepancy attributed to the disproportionate influence of species-specific high-copy repetitive elements. These findings underscore the dual nature of BPE tokenization: while it effectively compresses repetitive sequences, its sensitivity to high-copy elements limits its utility as a universal tool for comparative genomics. We discuss potential hybrid strategies and repeat-masking approaches to refine genomic tokenization, emphasizing the need for domain-specific adaptations in the development of large-scale genomic language models.

Such a representation with labels rather than logical constructors would not allow a reasoner to interpret lacks_part as a kind of negation of has_part. It is known that adding negation to the tractable Description Logic (DL) EL allowing for conjunction, existential restriction and concept inclusion makes it intractable since the obtained logic includes implicitly disjunction and universal restriction which interact with other constructors. In this paper, we propose a new extension of EL with a weakened negation allowing to represent negative knowledge while retaining tractability. To this end, we introduce categorical semantics of all logical constructors of the DL SH including EL with disjunction, negation, universal restriction, role inclusion and transitive roles. The categorical semantics of a logical constructor is usually described as a set of categorical properties referring to several objects without using set membership. To restore tractability, we have to weaken semantics of disjunction and universal restriction by identifying \\emph{independent} categorical properties that are responsible for intractability, and dropping them from the set of categorical properties. We show that the logic resulting from weakening semantics is more expressive than EL with the bottom concept, transitive roles and role inclusion.'}

Recent U.S. state policies now mandate appeals processes and recovering compensation during the period of wrongful deactivation based on past earnings. Yet, labor organizers still lack effective tools to support these complex, error-prone workflows. We designed FareShare, a computational tool automating lost wage estimation for deactivated drivers, through a 6 month partnership with the State of Washington's largest rideshare labor union.

We observed that the tool could reduce lost wage calculation time by over 95%, eliminate manual data entry errors, and enable legal teams to generate arbitration-ready reports more efficiently.

We employ these metrics to evaluate four distinct simplification algorithms, across several TSC algorithms and across datasets of varying characteristics, from seasonal or stationary to short or long.

However, deep learning models are often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty. Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results. Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels.

In addition, the rise of increasingly powerful predictive algorithms brought about by the recent revolution in artificial intelligence has led to an emphasis on building predictive algorithms that are fair, in the sense that their predictions do not systematically evince bias or bring about harm to certain individuals or groups. This state of affairs presents two conceptual challenges. First, the goals of accuracy and fairness can sometimes be in tension, and there are no obvious normative guidelines for managing the trade-offs between these two desiderata when they arise. Second, there are many distinct ways of measuring both the accuracy and fairness of a predictive algorithm; here too, there are no obvious guidelines on how to aggregate our preferences for predictive algorithms that satisfy disparate measures of fairness and accuracy to various extents. The goal of this paper is to address these challenges by arguing that there are good reasons for using a linear combination of accuracy and fairness metrics to measure the all-things-considered value of a predictive algorithm for agents who care about both accuracy and fairness.

Measuring AI Use in Student Writing Through Stylometric Evidence', 'authors': 'Eduardo Araujo Oliveira, Madhavi Mohoni, Sonsoles López-Pernas, Mohammed Saqr', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08828', 'abstract': "As human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent in educational contexts, understanding and measuring the extent and nature of such interactions pose significant challenges. This research investigates the use of authorship verification (AV) techniques not as a punitive measure, but as a means to quantify AI assistance in academic writing, with a focus on promoting transparency, interpretability, and student development. Building on prior work, we structured our investigation into three stages: dataset selection and expansion, AV method development, and systematic evaluation. Using three datasets - including a public dataset (PAN-14) and two from University of Melbourne students from various courses - we expanded the data to include LLM-generated texts, totalling 1,889 documents and 540 authorship problems from 506 students. We developed an adapted Feature Vector Difference AV methodology to construct robust academic writing profiles for students, designed to capture meaningful, individual characteristics of their writing. The method's effectiveness was evaluated across multiple scenarios, including distinguishing between student-authored and LLM-generated texts and testing resilience against LLMs' attempts to mimic student writing styles. Results demonstrate the enhanced AV classifier's ability to identify stylometric discrepancies and measure human-AI collaboration at word and sentence levels while providing educators with a transparent tool to support academic integrity investigations. This work advances AV technology, offering actionable insights into the dynamics of academic writing in an AI-driven era."}

Our experiments on Countdown puzzles and MIT Integration Bee problems show that models can provide reliable reward signals without ground truth answers, enabling reinforcement learning in domains previously not possible. By implementing self-judging, we achieve significant performance gains maintaining alignment with formal verification. When combined with synthetic question generation, we establish a complete self-improvement loop where models generate practice problems, solve them, and evaluate their own performance-achieving an 8% improvement with Qwen 2.5 7B over baseline and surpassing GPT-4o performance on integration tasks. Our findings demonstrate that LLM judges can provide effective reward signals for training models, unlocking many reinforcement learning environments previously limited by the difficulty of creating programmatic rewards. This suggests a potential paradigm shift toward AI systems that continuously improve through self-directed learning rather than human-guided training, potentially accelerating progress in domains with scarce training data or complex evaluation requirements.'}

Traditional methods, such as gradient-based or biologically inspired approaches, often fail in realistic, turbulent conditions. To address these challenges, we present a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm designed for localizing multiple airborne pollution sources using a swarm of small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS). Our method models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Game (POMG), employing a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Action-specific Double Deep Recurrent Q-Network (ADDRQN) that uses full sequences of historical action-observation pairs, effectively approximating latent states. Unlike prior work, we use a general-purpose simulation environment based on the Gaussian Plume Model (GPM), incorporating realistic elements such as a three-dimensional environment, sensor noise, multiple interacting agents, and multiple plume sources. The incorporation of action histories as part of the inputs further enhances the adaptability of our model in complex, partially observable environments. Extensive simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms conventional approaches. Specifically, our model allows agents to explore only 1.29\\% of the environment to successfully locate pollution sources.'}

Post-training quantization reduces memory and computation but often degrades accuracy, while quantization-aware training can recover performance at the cost of extra training. Pushing quantization to the ternary (2-bit) regime yields even larger savings but is notoriously unstable. Building on recent work showing that a bias-free, RMS-normalized Transformer with straight-through estimation can reach 1.58-bit precision, we demonstrate that simply inserting RMS normalization before every linear projection and applying a gradual, layer-wise quantization schedule stably fine-tunes full-precision checkpoints into ternary LLMs. Our approach matches or surpasses more elaborate knowledge-distillation pipelines on standard language-modeling benchmarks without adding model complexity. These results indicate that careful normalization alone can close much of the accuracy gap between ternary and full-precision LLMs, making ultra-low-bit inference practical.'}

Although recent advances in transformer-based architectures have demonstrated the power of attention mechanisms in complex multivariate time series prediction, their potential for blood glucose (BG) prediction remains underexplored. We present a comparative analysis of transformer models for multi-horizon BG prediction, examining forecasts up to 4 hours and input history up to 1 week. The publicly available DCLP3 dataset (n=112) was split (80%-10%-10%) for training, validation, and testing, and the OhioT1DM dataset (n=12) served as an external test set. We trained networks with point-wise, patch-wise, series-wise, and hybrid embeddings, using CGM, insulin, and meal data. For short-term blood glucose prediction, Crossformer, a patch-wise transformer architecture, achieved a superior 30-minute prediction of RMSE (15.6 mg / dL on OhioT1DM). For longer-term predictions (1h, 2h, and 4h), PatchTST, another path-wise transformer, prevailed with the lowest RMSE (24.6 mg/dL, 36.1 mg/dL, and 46.5 mg/dL on OhioT1DM). In general, models that used tokenization through patches demonstrated improved accuracy with larger input sizes, with the best results obtained with a one-week history. These findings highlight the promise of transformer-based architectures for BG prediction by capturing and leveraging seasonal patterns in multivariate time-series data to improve accuracy.'}

Defining these reporting standards is inherently challenging due to the diverse nature of studies involving VLMs, which vary significantly from the development of all new VLMs or finetuning for domain alignment to off-the-shelf use of VLM for targeted diagnosis and prediction tasks. In this position paper, we argue that traditional machine learning reporting standards and evaluation guidelines must be restructured to accommodate multiphase VLM studies; it also has to be organized for intuitive understanding of developers while maintaining rigorous standards for reproducibility. To facilitate community adoption, we propose a categorization framework for VLM studies and outline corresponding reporting standards that comprehensively address performance evaluation, data reporting protocols, and recommendations for manuscript composition. These guidelines are organized according to the proposed categorization scheme. Lastly, we present a checklist that consolidates reporting standards, offering a standardized tool to ensure consistency and quality in the publication of VLM-related research.'}

By inputting test cases, the behavior of models is examined for anomalies, and coverage metrics are utilized to determine the extent of neurons covered by these test cases. With the widespread application and advancement of DNNs, different types of neural behaviors have garnered attention, leading to the emergence of various coverage metrics for neural networks. However, there is currently a lack of empirical research on these coverage metrics, specifically in analyzing the relationships and patterns between model depth, configuration information, and neural network coverage. This paper aims to investigate the relationships and patterns of four coverage metrics: primary functionality, boundary, hierarchy, and structural coverage. A series of empirical experiments were conducted, selecting LeNet, VGG, and ResNet as different DNN architectures, along with 10 models of varying depths ranging from 5 to 54 layers, to compare and study the relationships between different depths, configuration information, and various neural network coverage metrics. Additionally, an investigation was carried out on the relationships between modified decision/condition coverage and dataset size. Finally, three potential future directions are proposed to further contribute to the security testing of DNN Models.'}

This study introduces a robust and scalable framework to detect DDoS attacks in highway-based VANET environments. A synthetic dataset was constructed using Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) in conjunction with the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) and further enriched with real-world mobility traces from Germany's A81 highway, extracted via OpenStreetMap (OSM). Three traffic categories were simulated: DDoS, VoIP, and TCP-based video streaming (VideoTCP). The data preprocessing pipeline included normalization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature engineering, missing value imputation, and class balancing using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Eleven classifiers were benchmarked, among them XGBoost (XGB), CatBoost (CB), AdaBoost (AB), GradientBoosting (GB), and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). XGB and CB achieved the best performance, each attaining an F1-score of 96%. These results highlight the robustness of the proposed framework and its potential for real-time deployment in VANETs to secure critical emergency communications."}

Existing backdoor formulations mainly address single-attack scenarios and are limited to Gaussian noise input models. To fill this gap, we propose MixBridge, a novel diffusion Schrödinger bridge (DSB) framework to cater to arbitrary input distributions (taking I2I tasks as special cases). Beyond this trait, we demonstrate that backdoor triggers can be injected into MixBridge by directly training with poisoned image pairs. This eliminates the need for the cumbersome modifications to stochastic differential equations required in previous studies, providing a flexible tool to study backdoor behavior for bridge models. However, a key question arises: can a single DSB model train multiple backdoor triggers? Unfortunately, our theory shows that when attempting this, the model ends up following the geometric mean of benign and backdoored distributions, leading to performance conflict across backdoor tasks. To overcome this, we propose a Divide-and-Merge strategy to mix different bridges, where models are independently pre-trained for each specific objective (Divide) and then integrated into a unified model (Merge). In addition, a Weight Reallocation Scheme (WRS) is also designed to enhance the stealthiness of MixBridge. Empirical studies across diverse generation tasks speak to the efficacy of MixBridge.'}

While sparse representations offer a more efficient alternative by avoiding dense BEV processing, existing methods often lag behind due to the lack of tailored designs. These limitations have hindered the competitiveness of sparse representations in online HD map construction. In this work, we systematically revisit and enhance sparse representation techniques, identifying key architectural and algorithmic improvements that bridge the gap with--and ultimately surpass--dense approaches. We introduce a dedicated network architecture optimized for sparse map feature extraction, a sparse-dense segmentation auxiliary task to better leverage geometric and semantic cues, and a denoising module guided by physical priors to refine predictions. Through these enhancements, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, significantly advancing HD map construction and centerline detection.

We expand the synthetic data training and model collapse study to multi-modal vision-language generative systems, such as vision-language models (VLMs) and text-to-image diffusion models, as well as recursive generate-train loops with multiple models. We find that model collapse, previously observed in single-modality generative models, exhibits distinct characteristics in the multi-modal context, such as improved vision-language alignment and increased variance in VLM image-captioning task. Additionally, we find that general approaches such as increased decoding budgets, greater model diversity, and relabeling with frozen models can effectively mitigate model collapse. Our findings provide initial insights and practical guidelines for reducing the risk of model collapse in self-improving multi-agent AI systems and curating robust multi-modal synthetic datasets.'}

To optimize input representations for the model, an ablation study was performed, comparing three feature configurations: skeletal-only, facial-only, and a combination of both. Experimental results show that combining facial and skeletal features yields the highest accuracy (80.88%) in the three-class model, outperforming models using only facial or skeletal features.

Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference, without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models (VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size, suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical environments.
