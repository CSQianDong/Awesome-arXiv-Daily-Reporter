However, training them to succeed on long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks remains challenging. Current methods primarily fall into two categories. The first relies on dense human annotations through behavior cloning, which is prohibitively expensive for long-horizon tasks that can take days or months. The second depends on outcome-driven sampling, which often collapses due to the rarity of valid positive trajectories on domain-specialized tasks. We introduce Apollo, a sampling framework that integrates asynchronous human guidance with action-level data filtering. Instead of requiring annotators to shadow every step, Apollo allows them to intervene only when the agent drifts from a promising trajectory, by providing prior knowledge, strategic advice, etc. This lightweight design makes it possible to sustain interactions for over 30 hours and produces valuable trajectories at a lower cost. Apollo then applies supervision control to filter out sub-optimal actions and prevent error propagation. Together, these components enable reliable and effective data collection in long-horizon environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Apollo, we evaluate it using InnovatorBench. Our experiments show that when applied to train the GLM-4.5 model on InnovatorBench, Apollo achieves more than a 50% improvement over the untrained baseline and a 28% improvement over a variant trained without human interaction. These results highlight the critical role of human-in-the-loop sampling and the robustness of Apollo's design in handling long-horizon, domain-specialized tasks."}

We consider other definitions of Agentic AI and propose a new realist definition. Agentic AI is a software delivery mechanism, comparable to software as a service (SaaS), which puts an application to work autonomously in a complex enterprise setting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) as foundation models have driven excitement in Agentic AI. We note, however, that Agentic AI systems are primarily applications, not foundations, and so their success depends on validation by end users and principal stakeholders. The tools and techniques needed by the principal users to validate their applications are quite different from the tools and techniques used to evaluate foundation models. Ironically, with good validation measures in place, in many cases the foundation models can be replaced with much simpler, faster, and more interpretable models that handle core logic.

However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-step policy. We introduce BEAT, the first framework to inject such visual backdoors into MLLM-based embodied agents using objects in the environments as triggers. Unlike textual triggers, object triggers exhibit wide variation across viewpoints and lighting, making them difficult to implant reliably. BEAT addresses this challenge by (1) constructing a training set that spans diverse scenes, tasks, and trigger placements to expose agents to trigger variability, and (2) introducing a two-stage training scheme that first applies supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and then our novel Contrastive Trigger Learning (CTL). CTL formulates trigger discrimination as preference learning between trigger-present and trigger-free inputs, explicitly sharpening the decision boundaries to ensure precise backdoor activation. Across various embodied agent benchmarks and MLLMs, BEAT achieves attack success rates up to 80%, while maintaining strong benign task performance, and generalizes reliably to out-of-distribution trigger placements. Notably, compared to naive SFT, CTL boosts backdoor activation accuracy up to 39% under limited backdoor data. These findings expose a critical yet unexplored security risk in MLLM-based embodied agents, underscoring the need for robust defenses before real-world deployment.'}

However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some inadvertent bias in the space of reasoning they cover; they also cannot be formally verified. On the other hand, systems like Lean can guarantee verifiability, but are not well-suited to capture the nature of agentic decision chain-based tasks. This creates a gap both in performance for functions such as business agents or code assistants, and in the usefulness of LLM reasoning benchmarks, whereby these fall short in reasoning structure or real-world alignment. We introduce TempoBench, the first formally grounded and verifiable diagnostic benchmark that parametrizes difficulty to systematically analyze how LLMs perform reasoning. TempoBench uses two evaluation benchmarks to break down reasoning ability. First, temporal trace evaluation (TTE) tests the ability of an LLM to understand and simulate the execution of a given multi-step reasoning system. Subsequently, temporal causal evaluation (TCE) tests an LLM's ability to perform multi-step causal reasoning and to distill cause-and-effect relations from complex systems. We find that models score 65.6% on TCE-normal, and 7.5% on TCE-hard. This shows that state-of-the-art LLMs clearly understand the TCE task but perform poorly as system complexity increases.

Current methods for generating synthetic geometric data involve rephrasing or expanding existing problems and utilizing predefined rules and templates to create geometric images and problems.

Additionally, the geometric images synthesized by existing methods tend to exhibit limited variation and deviate significantly from authentic geometric diagrams.

This paper introduces \\textbf{DeepCompress}, a novel framework that simultaneously enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of LRMs. We challenge the prevailing approach of consistently favoring shorter reasoning paths, showing that longer responses can contain a broader range of correct solutions for difficult problems. DeepCompress employs an adaptive length reward mechanism that dynamically classifies problems as ``Simple'' or ``Hard'' in real-time based on the model's evolving capability. It encourages shorter, more efficient reasoning for ``Simple'' problems while promoting longer, more exploratory thought chains for ``Hard'' problems. This dual-reward strategy enables the model to autonomously adjust its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) length, compressing reasoning for well-mastered problems and extending it for those it finds challenging. Experimental results on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that DeepCompress consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy while significantly improving token efficiency."}

The core mechanism of Nous is a training framework grounded in the first principles of information theory. Within this framework, we define the information gain from dialogue as an intrinsic reward signal, which is fundamentally equivalent to the reduction of Shannon entropy over a structured task space. This reward design enables us to avoid reliance on costly human preference annotations or external reward models. To validate our framework, we develop an automated simulation pipeline to generate a large-scale, preference-based dataset for the challenging task of scientific diagram generation. Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, subjective and objective evaluations, and tests across user expertise levels, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Nous achieves leading efficiency and output quality, while remaining robust to varying user expertise.

Existing approaches often rely on rule-based logic, game-theoretic models, or 'black-box' machine learning methods. However, these models typically lack flexibility or overlook the underlying mechanisms, such as sensory and motor constraints, which shape how pedestrians and drivers perceive and act in interactive scenarios. In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of pedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised pedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints, two with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across behavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined model with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints lead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during crossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual uncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more cautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this data-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning model, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training datasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by modelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level distributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on pedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling. Overall, our work demonstrates that multi-agent RL with human constraints is a promising modelling approach for simulating realistic road user interactions."}

Despite being human-readable, these heuristics remain largely opaque even to domain experts. Building on this analysis, we propose a new class of algorithms tailored to these specific bin packing instances. The derived algorithms are significantly simpler, more efficient, more interpretable, and more generalizable, suggesting that the considered instances are themselves relatively simple. We then discuss the limitations of the claim regarding LLMs' contribution to this problem, which appears to rest on the mistaken assumption that the instances had previously been studied.

This distinction presents an opportunity to guide process discovery in a more outcome-aware manner. Discovering a single process model without considering outcomes can yield representations poorly suited for conformance checking and performance analysis, as they fail to capture critical behavioral differences. Moreover, prioritizing one behavior over the other may obscure structural distinctions vital for understanding process outcomes. By learning interpretable discriminative rules over control-flow features, we group traces with similar desirability profiles and apply process discovery separately within each group. This results in focused and interpretable models that reveal the drivers of both desirable and undesirable executions. The approach is implemented as a publicly available tool and it is evaluated on multiple real-life event logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in isolating and visualizing critical process patterns.'}

In such cases, the amount of information to learn increases exponentially with the number of unordered subtasks. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing three generalisations of RMs: (1) Numeric RMs allow users to express complex tasks in a compact form. (2) In Agenda RMs, states are associated with an agenda that tracks the remaining subtasks to complete. (3) Coupled RMs have coupled states associated with each subtask in the agenda.

For routing, we replaced a Llama 3.1 70B model with a fine-tuned 8B variant, achieving 96\\% accuracy, a 10x reduction in model size, and 70\\% latency improvement. For query rephrasal, fine-tuning yielded a 3.7\\% gain in accuracy and a 40\\% latency reduction. Our approach demonstrates how human-in-the-loop (HITL) feedback, when structured within a data flywheel, transforms enterprise AI agents into self-improving systems. Key learnings include approaches to ensure agent robustness despite limited user feedback, navigating privacy constraints, and executing staged rollouts in production. This work offers a repeatable blueprint for building robust, adaptive enterprise AI agents capable of learning from real-world usage at scale."}

Users may prefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they value output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff effectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used for a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing methods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but this requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately set the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Effort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains models to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current average chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates dataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy tradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the cost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at inference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate resources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x reduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance relative to the base model used for RL training.'}

In domains with spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as inappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question of whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal masking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because few domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same dataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which naturally supports both representations. We train language models with bidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial (board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models trained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} - consistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on sequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are methodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to spatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data, and in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization.'}

This compression hinders verification by lacking explicit, step-wise justifications and inhibits cross-domain links by collapsing the very pathways that establish the logical and causal connections between concepts. We introduce a scalable framework that decompresses scientific reasoning, constructing a verifiable Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT) knowledge base and projecting it into an emergent encyclopedia, SciencePedia. Our pipeline operationalizes an endpoint-driven, reductionist strategy: a Socratic agent, guided by a curriculum of around 200 courses, generates approximately 3 million first-principles questions. To ensure high fidelity, multiple independent solver models generate LCoTs, which are then rigorously filtered by prompt sanitization and cross-model answer consensus, retaining only those with verifiable endpoints. This verified corpus powers the Brainstorm Search Engine, which performs inverse knowledge search -- retrieving diverse, first-principles derivations that culminate in a target concept. This engine, in turn, feeds the Plato synthesizer, which narrates these verified chains into coherent articles. The initial SciencePedia comprises approximately 200,000 fine-grained entries spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and computation. In evaluations across six disciplines, Plato-synthesized articles (conditioned on retrieved LCoTs) exhibit substantially higher knowledge-point density and significantly lower factual error rates than an equally-prompted baseline without retrieval (as judged by an external LLM). Built on this verifiable LCoT knowledge base, this reasoning-centric approach enables trustworthy, cross-domain scientific synthesis at scale and establishes the foundation for an ever-expanding encyclopedia.'}

We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction to continuous next-vector prediction. CALM uses a high-fidelity autoencoder to compress a chunk of K tokens into a single continuous vector, from which the original tokens can be reconstructed with over 99.9\\% accuracy. This allows us to model language as a sequence of continuous vectors instead of discrete tokens, which reduces the number of generative steps by a factor of K. The paradigm shift necessitates a new modeling toolkit; therefore, we develop a comprehensive likelihood-free framework that enables robust training, evaluation, and controllable sampling in the continuous domain. Experiments show that CALM significantly improves the performance-compute trade-off, achieving the performance of strong discrete baselines at a significantly lower computational cost. More importantly, these findings establish next-vector prediction as a powerful and scalable pathway towards ultra-efficient language models. Code: this https URL. Project: this https URL.'}

Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.'}

Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the matrix-based Rényi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD."}

A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures, encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains, requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.'}

However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose \\eval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. \\eval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing.

Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in physically embodied models remains underexplored.

Remarkably, on some tasks it converges within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's 100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only behavior cloning and without explicit retry training.

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves fast convergence. We also use Rényi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling. We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First, when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.'}

Existing methods treat every annotated text-video pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently, embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.'}

SoftAE employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the real world.

Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2) steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation without the need for labeled concept data.

That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting, Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2) moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1) momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.

However, most existing methods focus on the weights of multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules, which are often identified as the main repositories of factual information. Other components, such as attention (Attn) modules, are often ignored during editing. This imbalance can leave residual outdated knowledge and limit editing effectiveness. We perform comprehensive knowledge localization experiments on advanced LLMs and find that Attn modules play a substantial role in factual knowledge storage and retrieval, especially in earlier layers. Based on these insights, we propose IntAttn-Edit, a method that extends the associative memory paradigm to jointly update both MLP and Attn modules. Our approach uses a knowledge balancing strategy that allocates update magnitudes in proportion to each module's measured contribution to knowledge storage. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that IntAttn-Edit achieves higher edit success, better generalization, and stronger knowledge preservation than prior methods. Further analysis shows that the balancing strategy keeps editing performance within an optimal range across diverse settings."}

Unlike ANNs, which depend on continuous-valued signals, SNNs operate using distinct spike events, making them inherently more energy-efficient and temporally dynamic. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of SNN design models, training algorithms, and multi-dimensional performance metrics, including accuracy, energy consumption, latency, spike count, and convergence behavior. Key neuron models such as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and training strategies, including surrogate gradient descent, ANN-to-SNN conversion, and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP), are examined in depth. Results show that surrogate gradient-trained SNNs closely approximate ANN accuracy (within 1-2%), with faster convergence by the 20th epoch and latency as low as 10 milliseconds. Converted SNNs also achieve competitive performance but require higher spike counts and longer simulation windows. STDP-based SNNs, though slower to converge, exhibit the lowest spike counts and energy consumption (as low as 5 millijoules per inference), making them optimal for unsupervised and low-power tasks. These findings reinforce the suitability of SNNs for energy-constrained, latency-sensitive, and adaptive applications such as robotics, neuromorphic vision, and edge AI systems. While promising, challenges persist in hardware standardization and scalable training.

Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace, the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability), but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness). Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that monitorability differs sharply across model families.

Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis and human interactions.

The semantic text description and coding latent are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.

However, developing and evaluating such systems is challenging due to the inherent complexity of enterprise environments, where data is fragmented across multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings, featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and administrative domains. Our benchmark uniquely captures key enterprise characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows.

Popular pipelines therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.\nWe propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements while processing less than 2% of video frames.

While recent efforts have reduced this gap, its underlying causes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we address this by showing that the multilingual reasoning gap largely stems from failures in language understanding-the model's inability to represent the multilingual input meaning into the dominant language (i.e., English) within its reasoning trace. This motivates us to examine whether understanding failures can be detected, as this ability could help mitigate the multilingual reasoning gap. To this end, we evaluate a range of detection methods and find that understanding failures can indeed be identified, with supervised approaches performing best. Building on this, we propose Selective Translation, a simple yet effective strategy that translates the multilingual input into English only when an understanding failure is detected. Experimental results show that Selective Translation bridges the multilingual reasoning gap, achieving near full-translation performance while using translation for only about 20% of inputs. Together, our work demonstrates that understanding failures are the primary cause of the multilingual reasoning gap and can be detected and selectively mitigated, providing key insight into its origin and a promising path toward more equitable multilingual reasoning.

Without principled validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's utility in real-world evaluation scenarios."}

Achieving a robust and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging, mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship between previously learned knowledge and new information across different training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images. Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations.

To address the current research limitations, this paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial morphology.

By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in multimodal fusion and classification tasks.

FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.

We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel, practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and predicting the onset of overfitting.

The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner (VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component, leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this representation.

To address these challenges, we propose Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment datasets.

Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods.

Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.'}

Traditional evaluation relies on ground truth for both systems, but this is often unavailable due to delayed or unknowable outcomes, high costs, or incomplete data, especially for long-standing systems deemed safe by convention. The more practical solution is not to compute absolute risk but the difference between systems. We therefore propose a marginal risk assessment framework, that avoids dependence on ground truth or absolute risk. It emphasizes three kinds of relative evaluation methodology, including predictability, capability and interaction dominance. By shifting focus from absolute to relative evaluation, our approach equips software teams with actionable guidance: identifying where AI enhances outcomes, where it introduces new risks, and how to adopt such systems responsibly.'}

However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E" for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses) in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario, large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy (generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of 2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks.

In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any additional fMRI data or retraining.

Although AI survey chatbots improve convenience, most are still reactive: they rely on fixed dialogue trees or static prompt templates and therefore cannot adapt within a session to fit individual users, which leads to generic follow-ups and weak response quality. We address these limitations with AURA (Adaptive Understanding through Reinforcement Learning for Assessment), a reinforcement learning framework for AI-driven adaptive conversational surveys. AURA quantifies response quality using a four-dimensional LSDE metric (Length, Self-disclosure, Emotion, and Specificity) and selects follow-up question types via an epsilon-greedy policy that updates the expected quality gain within each session. Initialized with priors extracted from 96 prior campus-climate conversations (467 total chatbot-user exchanges), the system balances exploration and exploitation across 10-15 dialogue exchanges, dynamically adapting to individual participants in real time. In controlled evaluations, AURA achieved a +0.12 mean gain in response quality and a statistically significant improvement over non-adaptive baselines (p=0.044, d=0.66), driven by a 63% reduction in specification prompts and a 10x increase in validation behavior. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning can give survey chatbots improved adaptivity, transforming static questionnaires into interactive, self-improving assessment systems.'}

Although level generators and the properties of the functional content that they create (e.g., playability) dominate most discourse in procedurally generated content (PCG), games that emotionally resonate with players tend to weave together a range of creative and multimodal content (e.g., music, sounds, visuals, narrative tone), and multimodal models have begun seeing at least experimental use for this purpose. However, it remains unclear what exactly such models generate, and with what degree of variability and fidelity: audio is an extremely broad class of output for a generative system to target.\nWithin the PCG community, expressive range analysis (ERA) has been used as a quantitative way to characterize generators' output space, especially for level generators. This paper adapts ERA to text-to-audio models, making the analysis tractable by looking at the expressive range of outputs for specific, fixed prompts. Experiments are conducted by prompting the models with several standardized prompts derived from the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50) dataset.

In this work, we propose a Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through von-Neumann entanglement entropy.

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We explore \\emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal activations (\\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues."}

To address this, we propose Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy designed for incremental data collection settings.

Bhatt, Pranay Samineni, Rohan Siva, Zhanyang Wang, Ufuk Topcu', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26935', 'abstract': 'As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\nBeyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space. This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a scalable, plug-and-play primitive for reliable neurosymbolic plan verification. Code and data are available at: this https URL.'}

Pappas, Vijay Kumar', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26915', 'abstract': 'Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps -- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world. While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However, current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an 87\\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and refining subtasks with online feedback.

This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable structural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia\'s informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification.

In response, we introduce BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency. BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs, while maintaining training efficiency.

While these guardrails often fail to interpret the encoded content, the underlying models can still process the harmful instructions. We introduce CPT-Filtering, a novel, model-agnostic with negligible-costs and near-perfect accuracy guardrail technique that aims to mitigate these attacks by leveraging the intrinsic behavior of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers. Our method is based on the principle that tokenizers, trained on natural language, represent out-of-distribution text, such as ciphers, using a significantly higher number of shorter tokens. Our technique uses a simple yet powerful artifact of using language models: the average number of Characters Per Token (CPT) in the text. This approach is motivated by the high compute cost of modern methods - relying on added modules such as dedicated LLMs or perplexity models. We validate our approach across a large dataset of over 100,000 prompts, testing numerous encoding schemes with several popular tokenizers. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple CPT threshold robustly identifies encoded text with high accuracy, even for very short inputs. CPT-Filtering provides a practical defense layer that can be immediately deployed for real-time text filtering and offline data curation.'}

While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods. We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\\times$ to $2.3\\times$ over autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the average speedup by $47$\\% and $48$\\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based baseline algorithms, respectively.

Our theoretical analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness. Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 % discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation.

Code queries cluster densely in embedding space while conversational queries distribute sparsely. Content staleness varies from minutes (stock data) to months (code patterns). Query repetition patterns range from power-law (code) to uniform (conversation), producing long tail cache hit rate distributions: high-repetition categories achieve 40-60% hit rates while low-repetition or volatile categories achieve 5-15% hit rates. Vector databases must exclude the long tail because remote search costs (30ms) require 15--20% hit rates to break even, leaving 20-30% of production traffic uncached. Uniform cache policies compound this problem: fixed thresholds cause false positives in dense spaces and miss valid paraphrases in sparse spaces; fixed TTLs waste memory or serve stale data. This paper presents category-aware semantic caching where similarity thresholds, TTLs, and quotas vary by query category. We present a hybrid architecture separating in-memory HNSW search from external document storage, reducing miss cost from 30ms to 2ms. This reduction makes low-hit-rate categories economically viable (break-even at 3-5% versus 15-20%), enabling cache coverage across the entire workload distribution. Adaptive load-based policies extend this framework to respond to downstream model load, dynamically adjusting thresholds and TTLs to reduce traffic to overloaded models by 9-17% in theoretical projections.'}

Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406 subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected. Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment, the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain data without skullstripping or registration.

We present a Scientific Machine Learning approach using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to model sensory adaptation dynamics in autism. Our framework combines ordinary differential equations grounded in biophysics with neural networks to capture both mechanistic understanding and individual variability. We demonstrate that UDEs achieve a 90.8% improvement over pure Neural ODEs while using 73.5% fewer parameters. The model successfully recovers physiological parameters within the 2% error and provides a quantitative risk assessment for sensory overload, predicting 17.2% risk for pulse stimuli with specific temporal patterns. This framework establishes foundations for personalized, evidence-based interventions in autism, with direct applications to wearable technology and clinical practice.'}

VeriStruct employs a planner module to orchestrate the systematic generation of abstractions, type invariants, specifications, and proof code. To address the challenge that LLMs often misunderstand Verus' annotation syntax and verification-specific semantics, VeriStruct embeds syntax guidance within prompts and includes a repair stage to automatically correct annotation errors. In an evaluation on eleven Rust data structure modules, VeriStruct succeeds on ten of the eleven, successfully verifying 128 out of 129 functions (99.2%) in total. These results represent an important step toward the goal of automatic AI-assisted formal verification."}

Markosyan, Bobbie Chern, Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13487', 'abstract': 'Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.'}

In order to search for neural network structures with better translation results, we considered perplexity as an auxiliary evaluation metric for the algorithm in addition to BLEU scores and iteratively improved each individual neural network within the population by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Experimental results show that the neural network structures searched by the algorithm outperform all the baseline models, and that the introduction of the auxiliary evaluation metric can find better models than considering only the BLEU score as an evaluation metric.'}
