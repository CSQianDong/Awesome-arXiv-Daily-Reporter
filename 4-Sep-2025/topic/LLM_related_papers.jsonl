We propose an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout). The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.'}

However, most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs' inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR."}

Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent, our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its optimized execution.'}

The system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete, continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.'}

To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits. AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently across multiple benchmarks."}

Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation.

A growing body of work illustrates the promise of integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function, adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR models to noise and complexity.

Existing solutions typically focus on individual SOLID principles or specific programming languages, leaving a gap in the ability to detect violations across all five principles in multi-language codebases. This paper presents a new approach: a methodology that leverages tailored prompt engineering to assess LLMs on their ability to detect SOLID violations across multiple languages. We present a benchmark of four leading LLMs-CodeLlama, DeepSeekCoder, QwenCoder, and GPT-4o Mini-on their ability to detect violations of all five SOLID principles. For this evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset of 240 manually validated code examples. Using this dataset, we test four distinct prompt strategies inspired by established zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques to systematically measure their impact on detection accuracy. Our emerging results reveal a stark hierarchy among models, with GPT-4o Mini decisively outperforming others, yet even struggles with challenging principles like DIP. Crucially, we show that prompt strategy has a dramatic impact, but no single strategy is universally best; for instance, a deliberative ENSEMBLE prompt excels at OCP detection while a hint-based EXAMPLE prompt is superior for DIP violations. Across all experiments, detection accuracy is heavily influenced by language characteristics and degrades sharply with increasing code complexity. These initial findings demonstrate that effective, AI-driven design analysis requires not a single best model, but a tailored approach that matches the right model and prompt to the specific design context, highlighting the potential of LLMs to support maintainability through AI-assisted code analysis.'}

A structured thematic synthesis revealed four categories of outcomes: (1) Convergent themes - commitment-based demand signals, black-box trust barriers, and efficiency gains were consistently emphasized across both datasets; (2) Partial overlaps - founders worried about outliers being averaged away and the stress of real customer validation, while synthetic personas highlighted irrational blind spots and framed AI as a psychological buffer; (3) Human-only themes - relational and advocacy value from early customer engagement and skepticism toward moonshot markets; and (4) Synthetic-only themes - amplified false positives and trauma blind spots, where AI may overstate adoption potential by missing negative historical experiences.\nWe interpret this comparative framework as evidence that LLM-driven personas constitute a form of hybrid social simulation: more linguistically expressive and adaptable than traditional rule-based agents, yet bounded by the absence of lived history and relational consequence.

Unbounded maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end. This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.'}

Our study yields actionable findings for applied researchers. First, LLMs prompted to generate pointwise scores directly from texts produce discontinuous distributions with bunching at arbitrary numbers.

While recent multilingual benchmarks attempt to bridge this gap, many rely on automatic translation, which can introduce errors and misrepresent the original cultural context. To address this, we introduce SinhalaMMLU, the first multiple-choice question answering benchmark designed specifically for Sinhala, a low-resource language. The dataset includes over 7,000 questions spanning secondary to collegiate education levels, aligned with the Sri Lankan national curriculum, and covers six domains and 30 subjects, encompassing both general academic topics and culturally grounded knowledge. We evaluate 26 LLMs on SinhalaMMLU and observe that, while Claude 3.5 sonnet and GPT-4o achieve the highest average accuracies at 67% and 62% respectively, overall model performance remains limited. In particular, models struggle in culturally rich domains such as the Humanities, revealing substantial room for improvement in adapting LLMs to low-resource and culturally specific contexts.'}

Leveraging Microsoft's Phi-4-multimodal-instruct, our fine-tuning method eliminates the need for complex architectural changes or separate training procedures conventionally required for these distinct tasks. Fine-tuned on the Speechocean762 dataset, the pronunciation evaluation scores predicted by the model exhibited a strong Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC > 0.7) with human-assigned scores, while achieving low Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) (both < 0.15). Notably, fine-tuning only the LoRA layers was sufficient to achieve performance levels comparable to those achieved by fine-tuning all audio layers. This research highlights that an integrated pronunciation assessment system can be established by adapting large multimodal models without full fine-tuning, utilizing a significantly simpler training methodology compared to previous joint models designed for simultaneous APA and MDD. This efficient LoRA-based approach paves the way for more accessible, integrated, and effective Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) technologies for English L2 learners."}

Alvarez', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03113', 'abstract': 'Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.'}

These tasks involve free-text annotations requiring expert-level judgments grounded in specific objectives (e.g., research questions or instructional goals). Evaluating whether LLM-generated annotations align with those generated by expert humans is challenging to do at scale, and currently, no validated, scalable measure of similarity in ideas exists. In this paper, we (i) introduce the scalable evaluation of interpretive annotation by LLMs as a critical and understudied task, (ii) propose IDEAlgin, an intuitive benchmarking paradigm for capturing expert similarity ratings via a "pick-the-odd-one-out" triplet judgment task, and (iii) evaluate various similarity metrics, including vector-based ones (topic models, embeddings) and LLM-as-a-judge via IDEAlgin, against these human benchmarks. Applying this approach to two real-world educational datasets (interpretive analysis and feedback generation), we find that vector-based metrics largely fail to capture the nuanced dimensions of similarity meaningful to experts. Prompting LLMs via IDEAlgin significantly improves alignment with expert judgments (9-30% increase) compared to traditional lexical and vector-based metrics. These results establish IDEAlgin as a promising paradigm for evaluating LLMs against open-ended expert annotations at scale, informing responsible deployment of LLMs in education and beyond.'}

However, no testbeds support application-oriented system evaluation in a practical setting, especially in assembly. To foster the development, we propose a new multimodal QA dataset on assembly activities. Our dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, consists of 391 QA pairs that require the multimodal understanding of human-activity recordings and their instruction manuals in an online-style manner. In the development, we adopt a semi-automated QA annotation approach, where LLMs generate candidates and humans verify them, as a cost-effective method, and further improve it by integrating fine-grained action labels to diversify question types. Furthermore, we create instruction task graphs for the target tasks of assembling toy vehicles. These newly created task graphs are used in our benchmarking experiment, as well as to facilitate the human verification process in the QA annotation. Utilizing our dataset, we benchmark models, including competitive proprietary multimodal models. Our results suggest great room for improvement for the current models. We believe our new evaluation dataset can contribute to the further development of procedural-activity assistants.'}

Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.'}
