**Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.

**Abstract**: Dense retrieval, as the core component of e-commerce search engines, maps user queries and items into a unified semantic space through pre-trained embedding models to enable large-scale real-time semantic retrieval. Despite the rapid advancement of LLMs gradually replacing traditional BERT architectures for embedding, their training paradigms still adhere to BERT-like supervised fine-tuning and hard negative mining strategies. This approach relies on complex offline hard negative sample construction pipelines, which constrain model iteration efficiency and hinder the evolutionary potential of semantic representation capabilities. Besides, existing multi-task learning frameworks face the seesaw effect when simultaneously optimizing semantic relevance and non-relevance objectives. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-GRPO, a multi-objective reinforcement learning-based dense retrieval framework designed to address these challenges. The method eliminates offline hard negative sample construction by dynamically retrieving Top-K candidate products for each query during training, while introducing a relevance LLM as a reward model to generate real-time feedback. Specifically, the retrieval model dynamically optimizes embedding representations through reinforcement learning, with reward signals combining LLM-generated relevance scores, product quality scores, and multi-way exclusivity metrics to achieve multi-objective user preference alignment and real-time error correction. This mechanism not only removes dependency on hard negatives but also mitigates the seesaw effect through collaborative multi-objective optimization, significantly enhancing the model's semantic generalization capability for complex long-tail queries. Extensive offline and online experiments validate the effectiveness of Retrieval-GRPO, which has been deployed on China's largest e-commerce platform.

# SMRC: Aligning Large Language Models with Student Reasoning for Mathematical Error Correction 

**Authors**: Biaojie Zeng, Min Zhang, Juan Zhou, Fengrui Liu, Ruiyang Huang, Xin Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14684)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

# Operationalizing Pluralistic Values in Large Language Model Alignment Reveals Trade-offs in Safety, Inclusivity, and Model Behavior 

**Authors**: Dalia Ali, Dora Zhao, Allison Koenecke, Orestis Papakyriakopoulos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14476)  

**Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?

**Abstract**: Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.

# NORA-1.5: A Vision-Language-Action Model Trained using World Model- and Action-based Preference Rewards 

**Authors**: Chia-Yu Hung, Navonil Majumder, Haoyuan Deng, Liu Renhang, Yankang Ang, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Dorien Herremans, Ziwei Wang, Soujanya Poria

**Abstract**: Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.

# Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language 

**Authors**: Minyoung Hwang, Alexandra Forsey-Smerek, Nathaniel Dennler, Andreea Bobu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.14565)  

**Abstract**: Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language.

# PROF: An LLM-based Reward Code Preference Optimization Framework for Offline Imitation Learning 

**Authors**: Shengjie Sun, Jiafei Lyu, Runze Liu, Mengbei Yan, Bo Liu, Deheng Ye, Xiu Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13765)  

**Abstract**: Offline imitation learning (offline IL) enables training effective policies without requiring explicit reward annotations. Recent approaches attempt to estimate rewards for unlabeled datasets using a small set of expert demonstrations. However, these methods often assume that the similarity between a trajectory and an expert demonstration is positively correlated with the reward, which oversimplifies the underlying reward structure. We propose PROF, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate and improve executable reward function codes from natural language descriptions and a single expert trajectory. We propose Reward Preference Ranking (RPR), a novel reward function quality assessment and ranking strategy without requiring environment interactions or RL training. RPR calculates the dominance scores of the reward functions, where higher scores indicate better alignment with expert preferences. By alternating between RPR and text-based gradient optimization, PROF fully automates the selection and refinement of optimal reward functions for downstream policy learning. Empirical results on D4RL demonstrate that PROF surpasses or matches recent strong baselines across numerous datasets and domains, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.
