**Authors**: Yaoyao Qian, Yifan Zeng, Yuchao Jiang, Chelsi Jain, Huazheng Wang

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in information retrieval tasks like passage ranking. Our research examines how instruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document comparison tasks, identifying what we term the "Ranking Blind Spot", a characteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these attacks. Our code is available at: this https URL

# Are Smaller Open-Weight LLMs Closing the Gap to Proprietary Models for Biomedical Question Answering? 

**Authors**: Damian Stachura, Joanna Konieczna, Artur Nowak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18843)  

**Abstract**: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing, with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions, we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances, open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Alireza Salemi, Cheng Li, Mingyang Zhang, Qiaozhu Mei, Zhuowan Li, Spurthi Amba Hombaiah, Weize Kong, Tao Chen, Hamed Zamani, Michael Bendersky  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19094)  

**Abstract**: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct, contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT), an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM) without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories, producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

# BloomIntent: Automating Search Evaluation with LLM-Generated Fine-Grained User Intents 

**Authors**: Yoonseo Choi, Eunhye Kim, Hyunwoo Kim, Donghyun Park, Honggu Lee, Jinyoung Kim, Juho Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18641)  

**Abstract**: If 100 people issue the same search query, they may have 100 different goals. While existing work on user-centric AI evaluation highlights the importance of aligning systems with fine-grained user intents, current search evaluation methods struggle to represent and assess this diversity. We introduce BloomIntent, a user-centric search evaluation method that uses user intents as the evaluation unit. BloomIntent first generates a set of plausible, fine-grained search intents grounded on taxonomies of user attributes and information-seeking intent types. Then, BloomIntent provides an automated evaluation of search results against each intent powered by large language models. To support practical analysis, BloomIntent clusters semantically similar intents and summarizes evaluation outcomes in a structured interface. With three technical evaluations, we showed that BloomIntent generated fine-grained, evaluable, and realistic intents and produced scalable assessments of intent-level satisfaction that achieved 72% agreement with expert evaluators. In a case study (N=4), we showed that BloomIntent supported search specialists in identifying intents for ambiguous queries, uncovering underserved user needs, and discovering actionable insights for improving search experiences. By shifting from query-level to intent-level evaluation, BloomIntent reimagines how search systems can be assessed -- not only for performance but for their ability to serve a multitude of user goals.

# From latent factors to language: a user study on LLM-generated explanations for an inherently interpretable matrix-based recommender system 

**Authors**: Maxime Manderlier, Fabian Lecron, Olivier Vu Thanh, Nicolas Gillis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18980)  

**Abstract**: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective, user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations this http URL evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.

# A Knowledge Graph and a Tripartite Evaluation Framework Make Retrieval-Augmented Generation Scalable and Transparent 

**Authors**: Olalekan K. Akindele, Bhupesh Kumar Mishra, Kenneth Y. Wertheim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19209)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced conversational Artificial Intelligence(AI) chatbots; however, domain-specific accuracy and the avoidance of factual inconsistencies remain pressing challenges, particularly for large datasets. Designing an effective chatbot with appropriate methods and evaluating its effectiveness is among the challenges in this domain. This study presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that harnesses a knowledge graph and vector search retrieval to deliver precise, context-rich responses in an exemplary use case from over high-volume engineering project-related emails, thereby minimising the need for document chunking. A central innovation of this work is the introduction of RAG Evaluation (RAG-Eval), a novel chain-of-thought LLM-based tripartite evaluation framework specifically developed to assess RAG applications. This framework operates in parallel with the chatbot, jointly assessing the user's query, the retrieved document, and the generated response, enabling a holistic evaluation across multiple quality metrics like query relevance, factual accuracy, coverage, coherence and fluency. The resulting scoring system is provided directly to users as a confidence score (1 to 100%), enabling quick identification of possible misaligned or incomplete answers. This proposed approach promotes transparency and rapid verification by incorporating metadata email IDs, timestamps into responses. Experimental comparisons against BERTScore and G-EVAL for summarisation evaluation tasks confirm its effectiveness, and empirical analysis also shows RAG-Eval reliably detects factual gaps and query mismatches, thereby fostering trust in high demand, data centric environments. These findings highlight a scalable path for developing accurate, user-verifiable chatbots that bridge the gap between high-level conversational fluency and factual accuracy.

# RELATE: Relation Extraction in Biomedical Abstracts with LLMs and Ontology Constraints 

**Authors**: Olawumi Olasunkanmi, Mathew Satursky, Hong Yi, Chris Bizon, Harlin Lee, Stanley Ahalt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19057)  

**Abstract**: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for drug discovery and clinical decision support but remain incomplete. Large language models (LLMs) excel at extracting biomedical relations, yet their outputs lack standardization and alignment with ontologies, limiting KG integration. We introduce RELATE, a three-stage pipeline that maps LLM-extracted relations to standardized ontology predicates using ChemProt and the Biolink Model. The pipeline includes: (1) ontology preprocessing with predicate embeddings, (2) similarity-based retrieval enhanced with SapBERT, and (3) LLM-based reranking with explicit negation handling. This approach transforms relation extraction from free-text outputs to structured, ontology-constrained representations. On the ChemProt benchmark, RELATE achieves 52% exact match and 94% accuracy@10, and in 2,400 HEAL Project abstracts, it effectively rejects irrelevant associations (0.4%) and identifies negated assertions. RELATE captures nuanced biomedical relationships while ensuring quality for KG augmentation. By combining vector search with contextual LLM reasoning, RELATE provides a scalable, semantically accurate framework for converting unstructured biomedical literature into standardized KGs.

# Soft Tokens, Hard Truths 

**Authors**: Natasha Butt, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Ismail Labiad, Julia Kempe, Yann Ollivier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19170)  

**Abstract**: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens.
This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

# Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data 

**Authors**: Siheng Li, Kejiao Li, Zenan Xu, Guanhua Huang, Evander Yang, Kun Li, Haoyuan Wu, Jiajia Wu, Zihao Zheng, Chenchen Zhang, Kun Shi, Kyrierl Deng, Qi Yi, Ruibin Xiong, Tingqiang Xu, Yuhao Jiang, Jianfeng Yan, Yuyuan Zeng, Guanghui Xu, Jinbao Xue, Zhijiang Xu, Zheng Fang, Shuai Li, Qibin Liu, Xiaoxue Li, Zhuoyu Li, Yangyu Tao, Fei Gao, Cheng Jiang, Bo Chao Wang, Kai Liu, Jianchen Zhu, Wai Lam, Wayyt Wang, Bo Zhou, Di Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19249)  

**Abstract**: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

# Steering Multimodal Large Language Models Decoding for Context-Aware Safety 

**Authors**: Zheyuan Liu, Zhangchen Xu, Guangyao Dou, Xiangchi Yuan, Zhaoxuan Tan, Radha Poovendran, Meng Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19212)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity (missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity, oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving model helpfulness.

# Extracting Conceptual Spaces from LLMs Using Prototype Embeddings 

**Authors**: Nitesh Kumar, Usashi Chatterjee, Steven Schockaert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19269)  

**Abstract**: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs, extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g. sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

# CompLLM: Compression for Long Context Q&A 

**Authors**: Gabriele Berton, Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan, Son Tran, Mubarak Shah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19228)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited. Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical utility.

# Context-Aware Hierarchical Taxonomy Generation for Scientific Papers via LLM-Guided Multi-Aspect Clustering 

**Authors**: Kun Zhu, Lizi Liao, Yuxuan Gu, Lei Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Bing Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19125)  

**Abstract**: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset, evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

# Beyond the Leaderboard: Understanding Performance Disparities in Large Language Models via Model Diffing 

**Authors**: Sabri Boughorbel, Fahim Dalvi, Nadir Durrani, Majd Hawasly  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18792)  

**Abstract**: As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management (-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted framework for comparing LLMs.

# When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yingming Zheng, Hanqi Li, Kai Yu, Lu Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18762)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.

# Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Xiaoqian Liu, Ke Wang, Yuchuan Wu, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li, Junge Zhang, Jianbin Jiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19199)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments.
However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging.
Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.
We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels.
In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.
These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.
Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.
Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.

# Extractive Fact Decomposition for Interpretable Natural Language Inference in one Forward Pass 

**Authors**: Nicholas Popovič, Michael Färber  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18901)  

**Abstract**: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training, we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and synthetic rationales. Code and data available at this https URL

# Global-Recent Semantic Reasoning on Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs with Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yunan Wang, Jianxin Li, Ziwei Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18742)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly, we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers. Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority, achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task. Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs and LLMs.

# MemOrb: A Plug-and-Play Verbal-Reinforcement Memory Layer for E-Commerce Customer Service 

**Authors**: Yizhe Huang, Yang Liu, Ruiyu Zhao, Xiaolong Zhong, Xingming Yue, Ling Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18713)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning. Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service scenarios.

# CCQA: Generating Question from Solution Can Improve Inference-Time Reasoning in SLMs 

**Authors**: Jin Young Kim, Ji Won Yoon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18536)  

**Abstract**: Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose \textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering (CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs. Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5 model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently. From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source code can be found at this https URL.

# Actions Speak Louder than Prompts: A Large-Scale Study of LLMs for Graph Inference 

**Authors**: Ben Finkelshtein, Silviu Cucerzan, Sujay Kumar Jauhar, Ryen White  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18487)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest, the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation, web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

# CogniLoad: A Synthetic Natural Language Reasoning Benchmark With Tunable Length, Intrinsic Difficulty, and Distractor Density 

**Authors**: Daniel Kaiser, Arnoldo Frigessi, Ali Ramezani-Kebrya, Benjamin Ricaud  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18458)  

**Abstract**: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$) regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs, CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic, factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

# Evaluating the Creativity of LLMs in Persian Literary Text Generation 

**Authors**: Armin Tourajmehr, Mohammad Reza Modarres, Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18401)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models' ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor, hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need for further refinement.

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths, where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians' diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs, offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

# Evaluating Large Language Models for Detecting Antisemitism 

**Authors**: Jay Patel, Hrudayangam Mehta, Jeremy Blackburn  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18293)  

**Abstract**: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work, we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content, specifically leveraging in-context definition as a policy guideline. We explore various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT. Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, increasing performance across all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5. Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

# Speculate Deep and Accurate: Lossless and Training-Free Acceleration for Offloaded LLMs via Substitute Speculative Decoding 

**Authors**: Pei-Shuo Wang, Jian-Jia Chen, Chun-Che Yang, Chi-Chih Chang, Ning-Chi Huang, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah, Kai-Chiang Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18344)  

**Abstract**: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups, we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment. SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

# Thinking in a Crowd: How Auxiliary Information Shapes LLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Haodong Zhao, Chenyan Zhao, Yansi Li, Zhuosheng Zhang, Gongshen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18163)  

**Abstract**: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process. Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is available at this https URL.

# SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework 

**Authors**: Junlin Wang, Zehao Wu, Shaowei Lu, Yanlan Li, Xinghao Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18167)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines. Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world RAG applications.

# ZERA: Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent - From Zero Instructions to Structured Prompts via Principle-based Optimization 

**Authors**: Seungyoun Yi, Minsoo Khang, Sungrae Park  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18158)  

**Abstract**: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM) performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning, summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at this https URL.

# GAUSS: Benchmarking Structured Mathematical Skills for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yue Zhang, Jiaxin Zhang, Qiuyu Ren, Tahsin Saffat, Xiaoxuan Liu, Zitong Yang, Banghua Zhu, Yi Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18122)  

**Abstract**: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of \textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of \textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

# Cross-Cultural Transfer of Commonsense Reasoning in LLMs: Evidence from the Arab World 

**Authors**: Saeed Almheiri, Rania Hossam, Mena Attia, Chenxi Wang, Preslav Nakov, Timothy Baldwin, Fajri Koto  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19265)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12 culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by 10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

# Analyzing Uncertainty of LLM-as-a-Judge: Interval Evaluations with Conformal Prediction 

**Authors**: Huanxin Sheng, Xinyi Liu, Hangfeng He, Jieyu Zhao, Jian Kang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18658)  

**Abstract**: LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis, which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and judge reprompting for better judgment.

# VIR-Bench: Evaluating Geospatial and Temporal Understanding of MLLMs via Travel Video Itinerary Reconstruction 

**Authors**: Hao Wang, Eiki Murata, Lingfang Zhang, Ayako Sato, So Fukuda, Ziqi Yin, Wentao Hu, Keisuke Nakao, Yusuke Nakamura, Sebastian Zwirner, Yi-Chia Chen, Hiroyuki Otomo, Hiroki Ouchi, Daisuke Kawahara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19002)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

# AECBench: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Knowledge Evaluation of Large Language Models in the AEC Field 

**Authors**: Chen Liang, Zhaoqi Huang, Haofen Wang, Fu Chai, Chunying Yu, Huanhuan Wei, Zhengjie Liu, Yanpeng Li, Hongjun Wang, Ruifeng Luo, Xianzhong Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18776)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain. The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization, Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review. Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits, particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents. Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into safety-critical engineering practices.

# Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions 

**Authors**: Junhao Su, Yuanliang Wan, Junwei Yang, Hengyu Shi, Tianyang Han, Junfeng Luo, Yurui Qiu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18847)  

**Abstract**: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

# PiMoE: Token-Level Routing for Integrating High-Precision Computation and Reasoning 

**Authors**: Hengbo Xiao, Jingyuan Fan, Xin Tong, Jingzhao Zhang, Chao Lu, Guannan He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18169)  

**Abstract**: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent systems.

# Safe-SAIL: Towards a Fine-grained Safety Landscape of Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoder Interpretation Framework 

**Authors**: Jiaqi Weng, Han Zheng, Hanyu Zhang, Qinqin He, Jialing Tao, Hui Xue, Zhixuan Chu, Xiting Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18127)  

**Abstract**: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever, prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu- lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors, yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process. We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

# TurnBack: A Geospatial Route Cognition Benchmark for Large Language Models through Reverse Route 

**Authors**: Hongyi Luo, Qing Cheng, Daniel Matos, Hari Krishna Gadi, Yanfeng Zhang, Lu Liu, Yongliang Wang, Niclas Zeller, Daniel Cremers, Liqiu Meng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18173)  

**Abstract**: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here: \href{this https URL}{TurnBack.}

# LLM-based Agents Suffer from Hallucinations: A Survey of Taxonomy, Methods, and Directions 

**Authors**: Xixun Lin, Yucheng Ning, Jingwen Zhang, Yan Dong, Yilong Liu, Yongxuan Wu, Xiaohua Qi, Nan Sun, Yanmin Shang, Pengfei Cao, Lixin Zou, Xu Chen, Chuan Zhou, Jia Wu, Shirui Pan, Bin Wang, Yanan Cao, Kai Chen, Songlin Hu, Li Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18970)  

**Abstract**: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18883)  

**Abstract**: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.

# Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic 

**Authors**: Zikang Tian, Shaohui Peng, Du Huang, Jiaming Guo, Ruizhi Chen, Rui Zhang, Xishan Zhang, Yuxuan Guo, Zidong Du, Qi Guo, Ling Li, Yewen Pu, Xing Hu, Yunji Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19077)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.

# Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs 

**Authors**: Dennis Gross, Helge Spieker, Arnaud Gotlieb  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18836)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

# Memory in Large Language Models: Mechanisms, Evaluation and Evolution 

**Authors**: Dianxing Zhang, Wendong Li, Kani Song, Jiaye Lu, Gang Li, Liuchun Yang, Sheng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18868)  

**Abstract**: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.

# Experience Scaling: Post-Deployment Evolution For Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Xingkun Yin, Kaibin Huang, Dong In Kim, Hongyang Du  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18771)  

**Abstract**: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions, distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores. Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

# Conf-Profile: A Confidence-Driven Reasoning Paradigm for Label-Free User Profiling 

**Authors**: Yingxin Li, Jianbo Zhao, Xueyu Ren, Jie Tang, Wangjie You, Xu Chen, Kan Zhou, Chao Feng, Jiao Ran, Yuan Meng, Zhi Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18864)  

**Abstract**: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

# Solving Math Word Problems Using Estimation Verification and Equation Generation 

**Authors**: Mitchell Piehl, Dillon Wilson, Ananya Kalita, Jugal Kalita  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18565)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

# TERAG: Token-Efficient Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Qiao Xiao, Hong Ting Tsang, Jiaxin Bai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18667)  

**Abstract**: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost. Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

# Autonomous Data Agents: A New Opportunity for Smart Data 

**Authors**: Yanjie Fu, Dongjie Wang, Wangyang Ying, Xiangliang Zhang, Huan Liu, Jian Pei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18710)  

**Abstract**: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

# Model selection meets clinical semantics: Optimizing ICD-10-CM prediction via LLM-as-Judge evaluation, redundancy-aware sampling, and section-aware fine-tuning 

**Authors**: Hong-Jie Dai, Zheng-Hao Li, An-Tai Lu, Bo-Tsz Shain, Ming-Ta Li, Tatheer Hussain Mir, Kuang-Te Wang, Min-I Su, Pei-Kang Liu, Ming-Ju Tsai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18846)  

**Abstract**: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

# From "What to Eat?" to Perfect Recipe: ChefMind's Chain-of-Exploration for Ambiguous User Intent in Recipe Recommendation 

**Authors**: Yu Fu, Linyue Cai, Ruoyu Wu, Yong Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18226)  

**Abstract**: Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user intent, ensuring semantic accuracy, and providing sufficient detail coverage. We propose ChefMind, a hybrid architecture combining Chain of Exploration (CoE), Knowledge Graph (KG), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a Large Language Model (LLM). CoE refines ambiguous queries into structured conditions, KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries, comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness, and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models. Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in handling fuzzy demands.

# Gödel Test: Can Large Language Models Solve Easy Conjectures? 

**Authors**: Moran Feldman, Amin Karbasi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18383)  

**Abstract**: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the Gödel Test: evaluating whether a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5 produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected. Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step toward frontier models eventually passing the Gödel Test.

# Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA): Behavioral Theory-Guided LLMs for Ridesourcing Mode Choice Modeling 

**Authors**: Mustafa Sameen, Xiaojian Zhang, Xilei Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18181)  

**Abstract**: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion, improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set. This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various applications.

# Large Language Models and Operations Research: A Structured Survey 

**Authors**: Yang Wang, Kai Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18180)  

**Abstract**: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.

# ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification 

**Authors**: Pritish Yuvraj, Siva Devarakonda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18400)  

**Abstract**: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking. Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

# Multimodal Health Risk Prediction System for Chronic Diseases via Vision-Language Fusion and Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Dingxin Lu, Shurui Wu, Xinyi Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18221)  

**Abstract**: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images, fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

# Evaluating the Safety and Skill Reasoning of Large Reasoning Models Under Compute Constraints 

**Authors**: Adarsha Balaji, Le Chen, Rajeev Thakur, Franck Cappello, Sandeep Madireddy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18382)  

**Abstract**: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length, and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

# SPADE: A Large Language Model Framework for Soil Moisture Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection in Precision Agriculture 

**Authors**: Yeonju Lee, Rui Qi Chen, Joseph Oboamah, Po Nien Su, Wei-zhen Liang, Yeyin Shi, Lu Gan, Yongsheng Chen, Xin Qiao, Jing Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18123)  

**Abstract**: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series data.

# On the Soundness and Consistency of LLM Agents for Executing Test Cases Written in Natural Language 

**Authors**: Sébastien Salva, Redha Taguelmimt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19136)  

**Abstract**: The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma). We provide prototype tools, test suites, and results.

# When Ads Become Profiles: Large-Scale Audit of Algorithmic Biases and LLM Profiling Risks 

**Authors**: Baiyu Chen, Benjamin Tag, Hao Xue, Daniel Angus, Flora Salim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18874)  

**Abstract**: Automated ad targeting on social media is opaque, creating risks of exploitation and invisibility to external scrutiny. Users may be steered toward harmful content while independent auditing of these processes remains blocked. Large Language Models (LLMs) raise a new concern: the potential to reverse-engineer sensitive user attributes from exposure alone. We introduce a multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups. Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.

# Algorithms for Adversarially Robust Deep Learning 

**Authors**: Alexander Robey  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19100)  

**Abstract**: Given the widespread use of deep learning models in safety-critical applications, ensuring that the decisions of such models are robust against adversarial exploitation is of fundamental importance. In this thesis, we discuss recent progress toward designing algorithms that exhibit desirable robustness properties. First, we discuss the problem of adversarial examples in computer vision, for which we introduce new technical results, training paradigms, and certification algorithms. Next, we consider the problem of domain generalization, wherein the task is to train neural networks to generalize from a family of training distributions to unseen test distributions. We present new algorithms that achieve state-of-the-art generalization in medical imaging, molecular identification, and image classification. Finally, we study the setting of jailbreaking large language models (LLMs), wherein an adversarial user attempts to design prompts that elicit objectionable content from an LLM. We propose new attacks and defenses, which represent the frontier of progress toward designing robust language-based agents.

# COLT: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Continual Tool Usage 

**Authors**: Yuyang Liu, Xinyuan Shi, Bang Yang, Peilin Zhou, Jiahua Dong, Long Chen, Ian Reid, Xiaondan Liang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18754)  

**Abstract**: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed COLT.

# Explore the Reinforcement Learning for the LLM based ASR and TTS system 

**Authors**: Changfeng Gao, Yabin Li, Keyu An, Zhifu Gao, Zhihao Du, Han Zhao, Xiangang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18569)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18523)  

**Abstract**: Inconsistencies are ubiquitous in law, administration, and jurisprudence. Though a cure is too much to hope for, we propose a technological remedy. Large language models (LLMs) can accurately extract propositions from arguments and compile them into natural data structures that enable coherence-driven inference (CDI) via combinatorial optimization. This neurosymbolic architecture naturally separates concerns and enables meaningful judgments about the coherence of arguments that can inform legislative and policy analysis and legal reasoning.

# FlexSED: Towards Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection 

**Authors**: Jiarui Hai, Helin Wang, Weizhe Guo, Mounya Elhilali  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18606)  

**Abstract**: Despite recent progress in large-scale sound event detection (SED) systems capable of handling hundreds of sound classes, existing multi-class classification frameworks remain fundamentally limited. They cannot process free-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly interaction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot adaptability. Although text-query-based separation methods have been explored, they primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that require precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and diverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an open-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained audio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-decoder composition and an adaptive fusion strategy to enable effective continuous training from pretrained weights. To ensure robust supervision, it also employs large language models (LLMs) to assist in event query selection during training, addressing challenges related to missing labels. As a result, FlexSED achieves superior performance compared to vanilla SED models on AudioSet-Strong, while demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. We release the code and pretrained models to support future research and applications based on FlexSED.

# FastMTP: Accelerating LLM Inference with Enhanced Multi-Token Prediction 

**Authors**: Yuxuan Cai, Xiaozhuan Liang, Xinghua Wang, Jin Ma, Haijin Liang, Jinwen Luo, Xinyu Zuo, Lisheng Duan, Yuyang Yin, Xi Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18362)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly powerful, the sequential nature of autoregressive generation creates a fundamental throughput bottleneck that limits the practical deployment. While Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has demonstrated remarkable benefits for model training efficiency and performance, its inherent potential for inference acceleration remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces FastMTP, a simple yet effective method that improves multi-step draft quality by aligning MTP training with its inference pattern, significantly enhancing speculative decoding performance. Our approach fine-tunes a single MTP head with position-shared weights on self-distilled data, enabling it to capture dependencies among consecutive future tokens and maintain high acceptance rates across multiple recursive draft steps. By integrating language-aware dynamic vocabulary compression into the MTP head, we further reduce computational overhead in the drafting process. Experimental results across seven diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FastMTP achieves an average of 2.03x speedup compared to standard next token prediction with lossless output quality, outperforming vanilla MTP by 82%. FastMTP requires only lightweight training and seamlessly integrates with existing inference frameworks, offering a practical and rapidly deployable solution for accelerating LLM inference.

# Check Field Detection Agent (CFD-Agent) using Multimodal Large Language and Vision Language Models 

**Authors**: Sourav Halder, Jinjun Tong, Xinyu Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18405)  

**Abstract**: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.

# Self-Evolving LLMs via Continual Instruction Tuning 

**Authors**: Le Huang, Jiazheng Kang, Cheng Hou, Zhe Zhao, Zhenxiang Yan, Chuan Shi, Ting Bai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18133)  

**Abstract**: In real-world industrial settings, large language models (LLMs) must learn continually to keep pace with diverse and evolving tasks, requiring self-evolution to refine knowledge under dynamic data distributions. However, existing continual learning (CL) approaches, such as replay and parameter isolation, often suffer from catastrophic forgetting: training on new tasks degrades performance on earlier ones by overfitting to the new distribution and weakening this http URL propose MoE-CL, a parameter-efficient adversarial mixture-of-experts framework for industrial-scale, self-evolving continual instruction tuning of LLMs. MoE-CL uses a dual-expert design: (1) a dedicated LoRA expert per task to preserve task-specific knowledge via parameter independence, mitigating forgetting; and (2) a shared LoRA expert to enable cross-task transfer. To prevent transferring task-irrelevant noise through the shared pathway, we integrate a task-aware discriminator within a GAN. The discriminator encourages the shared expert to pass only task-aligned information during sequential training. Through adversarial learning, the shared expert acquires generalized representations that mimic the discriminator, while dedicated experts retain task-specific details, balancing knowledge retention and cross-task generalization and thereby supporting this http URL experiments on the public MTL5 benchmark and an industrial Tencent3 benchmark validate the effectiveness of MoE-CL for continual instruction tuning. In real-world A/B testing for content compliance review on the Tencent Video platform, MoE-CL reduced manual review costs by 15.3%. These results demonstrate that MoE-CL is practical for large-scale industrial deployment where continual adaptation and stable transfer are critical.

**Abstract**: This paper presents EASE (Effortless Algorithmic Solution Evolution), an open-source and fully modular framework for iterative algorithmic solution generation leveraging large language models (LLMs). EASE integrates generation, testing, analysis, and evaluation into a reproducible feedback loop, giving users full control over error handling, analysis, and quality assessment. Its architecture supports the orchestration of multiple LLMs in complementary roles-such as generator, analyst, and evaluator. By abstracting the complexity of prompt design and model management, EASE provides a transparent and extensible platform for researchers and practitioners to co-design algorithms and other generative solutions across diverse domains.
