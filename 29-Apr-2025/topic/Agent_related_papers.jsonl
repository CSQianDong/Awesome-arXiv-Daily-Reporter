Crowdsourced fact-checking - where non-experts evaluate claim veracity - offers a cost-effective alternative to expert verification, despite concerns about variability in quality and bias. Encouraged by promising results in certain contexts, major platforms such as X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram have begun shifting from centralized moderation to decentralized, crowd-based approaches.\nIn parallel, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance across core fact-checking tasks, including claim detection and evidence evaluation. However, their potential role in crowdsourced workflows remains unexplored. This paper investigates whether LLM-powered generative agents - autonomous entities that emulate human behavior and decision-making - can meaningfully contribute to fact-checking tasks traditionally reserved for human crowds. Using the protocol of La Barbera et al. (2024), we simulate crowds of generative agents with diverse demographic and ideological profiles. Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and issue final veracity judgments.\nOur results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable, consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.'}

Central to our approach is a collaborative multi-agent architecture, where specialized agents, each guided by the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) hierarchy, work in concert to autonomously extract, synthesize, and self-evaluate high-quality textual data from vast scientific literature. These agents collectively generate and refine domain-specific question-answer pairs, ensuring comprehensive coverage and consistency with biomedical ontologies while minimizing manual involvement. Extensive experimental results show that language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong life sciences LLM baselines and advanced proprietary models. Notably, our AI-Ready dataset enables Llama3-70B to surpass GPT-4 with MedPrompt and Med-PaLM-2, despite their larger scale.

In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case, involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS. To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on different time horizons and across instances.'}

However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average of 10\\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.'}

Service Function Chains (SFCs), structured as ordered sequences of VNFs, are pivotal in orchestrating complex network services. Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning. By utilizing the self-attention mechanism, our approach effectively models complex inter-dependencies among VNFs, facilitating coordinated and parallelized decision-making processes. Additionally, we enhance training stability and convergence using $\\epsilon$-LoPe exploration strategy as well as Asymptotic Return Normalization. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions in terms of long-term acceptance rates, resource utilization efficiency, and scalability, while achieving rapid inference. This study not only advances intelligent network orchestration by delivering a scalable and robust solution for SFC partitioning within emerging 6G environments, but also bridging recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the optimization of next-generation networks.'}

The system combines a knowledge-graph-augmented architecture with two specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents: a Teaching Agent for dynamic interaction, and a Lesson Planning Agent for lesson plan generation. The system is designed to adapt to individual student needs, with interactions meticulously tracked and stored in a knowledge graph. This graph represents student actions, learning resources, and relationships, aiming to enable reasoning about effective learning pathways. We describe the implementation of the system, highlighting the challenges encountered and the solutions implemented, including introducing a dual-agent architecture where tasks are separated, all coordinated through a central knowledge graph that maintains system awareness, and a user-facing tag system intended to mitigate LLM hallucination and improve user control. Preliminary results illustrate the system's potential to capture rich interaction data, dynamically adapt lesson plans based on student feedback via a tag system in simulation, and facilitate context-aware tutoring through the integrated knowledge graph, though systematic evaluation is required."}

In this work, we introduce an off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm, EM Policy Gradient, aimed at enhancing LLM reasoning by optimizing expected return over reasoning trajectories. We frame the reasoning task as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) optimization problem, alternating between sampling diverse rationale trajectories and performing reward-guided fine-tuning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, which rely on complex importance weights and heuristic clipping, our method provides a simpler, more principled off-policy policy gradient approach, eliminating these complexities while maintaining strong performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of EM Policy Gradient on the GSM8K and MATH (HARD) datasets, where it achieves performance comparable to or slightly surpassing the state-of-the-art GRPO, while offering additional advantages in scalability, simplicity, and reasoning conciseness. Moreover, models fine-tuned with our method exhibit cognitive behaviors, such as sub-problem decomposition, self-verification, and backtracking, highlighting its potential to enhance both the interpretability and robustness of LLM reasoning."}

To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.'}

Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the live web. As part of WASP, we also develop baseline attacks against three popular web agentic systems (VisualWebArena, Claude Computer Use, and Operator) instantiated with various state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation shows that even AI agents backed by models with advanced reasoning capabilities and by models with instruction hierarchy mitigations are susceptible to low-effort human-written prompt injections. However, the realistic objectives in WASP also allow us to observe that agents are currently not capable enough to complete the goals of attackers end-to-end. Agents begin executing the adversarial instruction between 16 and 86% of the time but only achieve the goal between 0 and 17% of the time. Based on these findings, we argue that adversarial researchers should demonstrate stronger attacks that more consistently maintain control over the agent given realistic constraints on the adversary's power."}
