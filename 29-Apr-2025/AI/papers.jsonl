Given the remarkable applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent (PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in scientific literature and real-world knowledge.

Traditional well being theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire satisfaction, or objective list models. Such approaches struggle to account for cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions, allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and group flourishing over time."}

In this work, we consider a DTAP variant where every task is a case composed of a stochastic sequence of activities. The DTAP, in this case, involves the decision of which employee to assign to which activity to process requests as quickly as possible. In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising tool for tackling this DTAP variant, but most research is limited to solving small-scale, synthetic problems, neglecting the challenges posed by real-world use cases. To bridge this gap, this work proposes a DRL-based Decision Support System (DSS) for real-world scale DTAPS. To this end, we introduce a DRL agent with two novel elements: a graph structure for observations and actions that can effectively represent any DTAP and a reward function that is provably equivalent to the objective of minimizing the average cycle time of tasks. The combination of these two novelties allows the agent to learn effective and generalizable assignment policies for real-world scale DTAPs. The proposed DSS is evaluated on five DTAP instances whose parameters are extracted from real-world logs through process mining. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed DRL agent matches or outperforms the best baseline in all DTAP instances and generalizes on different time horizons and across instances.'}

To study these properties, we create a dataset with various types of evidence and analyze language models' responses and confidence using verbalized confidence, token probability, and sampling. We observed that language models do not consistently follow Bayesian epistemology: language models follow the Bayesian confirmation assumption well with true evidence but fail to adhere to other Bayesian assumptions when encountering different evidence types. Also, we demonstrated that language models can exhibit high confidence when given strong evidence, but this does not always guarantee high accuracy. Our analysis also reveals that language models are biased toward golden evidence and show varying performance depending on the degree of irrelevance, helping explain why they deviate from Bayesian assumptions."}

To address this challenge, we present Group Variance Policy Optimization (GVPO). GVPO incorporates the analytical solution to KL-constrained reward maximization directly into its gradient weights, ensuring alignment with the optimal policy. The method provides intuitive physical interpretations: its gradient mirrors the mean squared error between the central distance of implicit rewards and that of actual rewards. GVPO offers two key advantages: (1) it guarantees a unique optimal solution, exactly the KL-constrained reward maximization objective, (2) it supports flexible sampling distributions that avoids on-policy and importance sampling limitations.

A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.'}

In contrast, Small Language Models (SLMs) can operate efficiently, offering faster response times, and lower computational demands, making them potential candidates for function calling on edge devices. In this exploratory empirical study, we evaluate the efficacy of SLMs in generating function calls across diverse domains using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning approaches, both with and without prompt injection, while also providing the finetuned models to facilitate future applications. Furthermore, we analyze the model responses across a range of metrics, capturing various aspects of function call generation. Additionally, we perform experiments on an edge device to evaluate their performance in terms of latency and memory usage, providing useful insights into their practical applicability. Our findings show that while SLMs improve from zero-shot to few-shot and perform best with fine-tuning, they struggle significantly with adhering to the given output format.

The increasing availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of trust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes (e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in practice. To ground the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, a field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist.'}

Experimental evaluations on four diverse datasets - Auto MPG (7 variables), Beijing PM2.5 (10 variables), Boston Housing (13 variables), and Appliances Energy Consumption (27 variables) show that ADAR-based models achieve consistently lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Similarly, on the high-dimensional Appliances Energy dataset, ADAR-ANFIS reached an RMSE of 83.25 with nine rules, outperforming established fuzzy logic approaches and interpretability-focused methods such as APLR. Ablation studies further reveal that combining rule-level and attribute-level weight assignment significantly reduces model overlap while preserving essential features, thereby enhancing explainability.

Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models.

This study proposes a cognitive-mechanistic framework (COGMIF) that enhances the IDHEAS-ECA methodology by integrating an ACT-R-based human digital twin (HDT) with TimeGAN-augmented simulation. The ACT-R model simulates operator cognition, including memory retrieval, goal-directed procedural reasoning, and perceptual-motor execution, under high-fidelity scenarios derived from a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) simulator. To overcome the resource constraints of large-scale cognitive modeling, TimeGAN is trained on ACT-R-generated time-series data to produce high-fidelity synthetic operator behavior datasets. These simulations are then used to drive IDHEAS-ECA assessments, enabling scalable, mechanism-informed estimation of human error probabilities (HEPs). Comparative analyses with SPAR-H and sensitivity assessments demonstrate the robustness and practical advantages of the proposed COGMIF. Finally, procedural features are mapped onto a Bayesian network to quantify the influence of contributing factors, revealing key drivers of operational risk.

Standard deep learning models often struggle with these challenges because their architectures inherently smooth over fine-grained fluctuations while focusing on general trends. This limitation arises from low-pass filtering effects, gate biases favoring stability, and memory update mechanisms that prioritize long-term information retention. To address these shortcomings, this study introduces a hybrid deep learning framework that integrates both long-term trend and short-term fluctuation information using two input features processed in parallel, designed to capture complementary aspects of traffic flow dynamics. Further, our approach leverages attention mechanisms, specifically Bahdanau attention, to selectively focus on critical time steps within traffic data, enhancing the model's ability to predict congestion and other transient phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that features learned from both branches are complementary, significantly improving the goodness-of-fit statistics across multiple prediction horizons compared to a baseline model. Notably, the attention mechanism enhances short-term forecast accuracy by directly targeting immediate fluctuations, though challenges remain in fully integrating long-term trends. This framework can contribute to more effective congestion mitigation and urban mobility planning by advancing the robustness and precision of traffic prediction models."}

Agents retrieve evidence, assess claims along multiple quality dimensions, and issue final veracity judgments.\nOur results show that agent crowds outperform human crowds in truthfulness classification, exhibit higher internal consistency, and show reduced susceptibility to social and cognitive biases. Compared to humans, agents rely more systematically on informative criteria such as Accuracy, Precision, and Informativeness, suggesting a more structured decision-making process. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of generative agents as scalable, consistent, and less biased contributors to crowd-based fact-checking systems.'}

This paper presents a novel method at the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, aiming to develop machine learning models with direct real-world applications in surgical contexts. We propose a multi-modal framework that leverages recent advancements in computer vision and large language models to generate comprehensive video summaries. %\nThe approach is structured in three key stages. First, surgical videos are divided into clips, and visual features are extracted at the frame level using visual transformers. This step focuses on detecting tools, tissues, organs, and surgical actions. Second, the extracted features are transformed into frame-level captions via large language models. These are then combined with temporal features, captured using a ViViT-based encoder, to produce clip-level summaries that reflect the broader context of each video segment. Finally, the clip-level descriptions are aggregated into a full surgical report using a dedicated LLM tailored for the summarization task. %\nWe evaluate our method on the CholecT50 dataset, using instrument and action annotations from 50 laparoscopic videos. The results show strong performance, achieving 96\\% precision in tool detection and a BERT score of 0.74 for temporal context summarization.

Previous studies have shown the potential of using single-view mammograms for breast cancer detection. However, incorporating multi-view data can provide more comprehensive insights. Multi-view classification, especially in medical imaging, presents unique challenges, particularly when dealing with large-scale, high-resolution data. In this work, we propose a novel Multi-view Visual Prompt Tuning Network (MVPT-NET) for analyzing multiple screening mammograms. We first pretrain a robust single-view classification model on high-resolution mammograms and then innovatively adapt multi-view feature learning into a task-specific prompt tuning process. This technique selectively tunes a minimal set of trainable parameters (7\\%) while retaining the robustness of the pre-trained single-view model, enabling efficient integration of multi-view data without the need for aggressive downsampling. Our approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature fusion methods, providing a more robust, scalable, and efficient solution for high-resolution mammogram analysis. Experimental results on a large multi-institution dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional approaches while maintaining detection efficiency, achieving an AUROC of 0.852 for distinguishing between Benign, DCIS, and Invasive classes.

We propose TurboQuant to address both mean-squared error (MSE) and inner product distortion, overcoming limitations of existing methods that fail to achieve optimal distortion rates. Our data-oblivious algorithms, suitable for online applications, achieve near-optimal distortion rates (within a small constant factor) across all bit-widths and dimensions. TurboQuant achieves this by randomly rotating input vectors, inducing a concentrated Beta distribution on coordinates, and leveraging the near-independence property of distinct coordinates in high dimensions to simply apply optimal scalar quantizers per each coordinate. Recognizing that MSE-optimal quantizers introduce bias in inner product estimation, we propose a two-stage approach: applying an MSE quantizer followed by a 1-bit Quantized JL (QJL) transform on the residual, resulting in an unbiased inner product quantizer. We also provide a formal proof of the information-theoretic lower bounds on best achievable distortion rate by any vector quantizer, demonstrating that TurboQuant closely matches these bounds, differing only by a small constant ($\\approx 2.7$) factor. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings, showing that for KV cache quantization, we achieve absolute quality neutrality with 3.5 bits per channel and marginal quality degradation with 2.5 bits per channel.

Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data.

More specifically, Seg2HOI inherits the properties of the vision foundation model (e.g., promptable and interactive mechanisms) and incorporates a decoder that applies these attributes to HOI task.

Despite the remarkable empirical success of foundation models, it is not very clear what representations they learn, and why these representations are useful for various downstream tasks. A scientific understanding of representation learning is critical, especially at this point when scaling up the model size is producing diminishing returns, and designing new pretraining methods is imperative for further progress.\nPrior work treated different representation learning methods quite differently, whereas the contexture theory provides a unified framework for analyzing these methods. The central argument is that a representation is learned from the association between the input X and a context variable A. We prove that if an encoder captures the maximum information of this association, in which case we say that the encoder learns the contexture, then it will be optimal on the class of tasks that are compatible with the context. We also show that a context is the most useful when the association between X and A is neither too strong nor too weak. The important implication of the contexture theory is that increasing the model size alone will achieve diminishing returns, and further advancements require better contexts.\nWe demonstrate that many pretraining objectives can learn the contexture, including supervised learning, self-supervised learning, generative models, etc. Then, we introduce two general objectives -- SVME and KISE, for learning the contexture. We also show how to mix multiple contexts together, an effortless way to create better contexts from existing ones. Then, we prove statistical learning bounds for representation learning. Finally, we discuss the effect of the data distribution shift from pretraining to the downstream task.'}

Yet, a critical question persists: how can vast volumes of external knowledge be managed effectively within the input constraints of LLMs? Traditional methods address this by chunking external documents into smaller, fixed-size segments. While this approach alleviates input limitations, it often fragments context, resulting in incomplete retrieval and diminished coherence in generation. To overcome these shortcomings, two advanced techniques, late chunking and contextual retrieval, have been introduced, both aiming to preserve global context. Despite their potential, their comparative strengths and limitations remain unclear. This study presents a rigorous analysis of late chunking and contextual retrieval, evaluating their effectiveness and efficiency in optimizing RAG systems. Our results indicate that contextual retrieval preserves semantic coherence more effectively but requires greater computational resources. In contrast, late chunking offers higher efficiency but tends to sacrifice relevance and completeness.'}

Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations.

Key limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability (provenance), and challenges in timely knowledge updates. Combining language models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from an initial lexical graph. As a consequence, our Tripartite-GraphRAG approach implements: i) a concept-specific, information-preserving pre-compression of textual chunks; ii) allows for the formation of a concept-specific relevance estimation of embedding similarities grounded in statistics; and iii) avoids common challenges w.r.t. continuous extendability, such as the need for entity resolution and deduplication. By applying a transformation to the knowledge graph, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an unsupervised node classification problem, drawing on ideas from Markov Random Fields. We evaluate our approach on a healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses given a set of medical concepts as well as clinical literature.

In this paper, we propose novel RISC-V extensions for accelerating DNN models containing semi-structured and unstructured sparsity. While the idea of accelerating structured and unstructured pruning is not new, our novel design offers various advantages over other designs. To exploit semi-structured sparsity, we take advantage of the fine-grained (bit-level) configurability of FPGAs and suggest reserving a few bits in a block of DNN weights to encode the information about sparsity in the succeeding blocks. The proposed custom functional unit utilizes this information to skip computations. To exploit unstructured sparsity, we propose a variable cycle sequential multiply-and-accumulate unit that performs only as many multiplications as the non-zero weights. Our implementation of unstructured and semi-structured pruning accelerators can provide speedups of up to a factor of 3 and 4, respectively. We then propose a combined design that can accelerate both types of sparsities, providing speedups of up to a factor of 5.

Dynamic robotic motion coupled with inherent estimation based SLAM processes introduce noise and errors, degrading map quality. Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) produces results that are often noisy and unclear. This is due to the fact that evidence based mapping represents maps according to uncertain observations.

Many human-being applications are conducted daily via NLP tasks, starting from machine translation, speech recognition, text generation and recommendations, Part-of-Speech tagging (POS), and Named-Entity Recognition (NER). However, low-resourced languages, such as the Central-Kurdish language (CKL), mainly remain unexamined due to shortage of necessary resources to support their development. The POS tagging task is the base of other NLP tasks; for example, the POS tag set has been used to standardized languages to provide the relationship between words among the sentences, followed by machine translation and text recommendation. Specifically, for the CKL, most of the utilized or provided POS tagsets are neither standardized nor comprehensive. To this end, this study presented an accurate and comprehensive POS tagset for the CKL to provide better performance of the Kurdish NLP tasks. The article also collected most of the POS tags from different studies as well as from Kurdish linguistic experts to standardized part-of-speech tags. The proposed POS tagset is designed to annotate a large CKL corpus and support Kurdish NLP tasks. The initial investigations of this study via comparison with the Universal Dependencies framework for standard languages, show that the proposed POS tagset can streamline or correct sentences more accurately for Kurdish NLP tasks.'}

This inefficiency, stemming from the lack of a visual concept model, limits LVLMs' usability in real-world applications. To address this, we propose VCM, an end-to-end self-supervised visual concept modeling framework. VCM leverages implicit contrastive learning across multiple sampled instances and vision-language fine-tuning to construct a visual concept model without requiring costly concept-level annotations. Our results show that VCM significantly reduces computational costs (e.g., 85\\% fewer FLOPs for LLaVA-1.5-7B) while maintaining strong performance across diverse image understanding tasks. Moreover, VCM enhances visual encoders' capabilities in classic visual concept perception tasks. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of VCM."}

However, existing methods usually train a dataset-specific deep network for each dataset. Due to the significant differences in the data distribution and labeling between various datasets, the trained dataset-specific deep network has poor generalization performances on other datasets. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a change adapter network (CANet) for a more universal and generalized CD. CANet contains dataset-shared and dataset-specific learning modules. The former explores the discriminative features of images, and the latter designs a lightweight adapter model, to deal with the characteristics of different datasets in data distribution and labeling. The lightweight adapter can quickly generalize the deep network for new CD tasks with a small computation cost. Specifically, this paper proposes an interesting change region mask (ICM) in the adapter, which can adaptively focus on interested change objects and decrease the influence of labeling differences in various datasets. Moreover, CANet adopts a unique batch normalization layer for each dataset to deal with data distribution differences. Compared with existing deep learning methods, CANet can achieve satisfactory CD performances on various datasets simultaneously. Experimental results on several public datasets have verified the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed CANet on CD. CANet has a stronger generalization ability, smaller training costs (merely updating 4.1%-7.7% parameters), and better performances under limited training datasets than other deep learning methods, which also can be flexibly inserted with existing deep models.'}

However, its lack of moderation allows misinformation, extremism, and toxicity to spread. While prior research focused on these particular phenomena or topics, these have mostly been examined separately, and a broader understanding of the Telegram ecosystem is still missing. In this work, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of the Italian Telegram sphere, leveraging a dataset of 186 million messages from 13,151 chats collected in 2023. Using network analysis, Large Language Models, and toxicity detection tools, we examine how different thematic communities form, align ideologically, and engage in harmful discourse within the Italian cultural context. Results show strong thematic and ideological homophily. We also identify mixed ideological communities where far-left and far-right rhetoric coexist on particular geopolitical issues. Beyond political analysis, we find that toxicity, rather than being isolated in a few extreme chats, appears widely normalized within highly toxic communities. Moreover, we find that Italian discourse primarily targets Black people, Jews, and gay individuals independently of the topic. Finally, we uncover common trend of intra-national hostility, where Italians often attack other Italians, reflecting regional and intra-regional cultural conflicts that can be traced back to old historical divisions. This study provides the first large-scale mapping of the Italian Telegram ecosystem, offering insights into ideological interactions, toxicity, and identity-targets of hate and contributing to research on online toxicity across different cultural and linguistic contexts on Telegram.'}

The results demonstrate that specialization can enhance a generalist's accuracy even without additional data or changing training regimes: solely by constraining class label space in which the network performs. Theoretical and experimental analyses indicate that effective specialization requires modifying traditional fine-tuning methods and constraining data space to semantically coherent subsets. The specialist extraction phase before tuning the network is proposed for maximal performance gains. We also provide analysis of the evolution of the feature space during specialization. This study paves way to future research for developing more advanced dynamically configurable image analysis systems, where computations depend on the specific input.

Then, two encoders are followed to extract geometric and topological features that address the challenge of quad-related constraints, especially by combining in-depth quadrilaterals-specific characteristics. Subsequently, the extracted features are fused to train the classifier with a designed compound loss. The final results are derived after the refinement by a quad-specific post-processing.

While standard transformers provide a natural black-box solution to this task, the presence of a well-structured evolution operator in the data suggests a more tailored and efficient approach. Specifically, when the PDE is fully known, classical numerical solvers can evolve the state accurately with only a few parameters. Building on this observation, we introduce DISCO, a model that uses a large hypernetwork to process a short trajectory and generate the parameters of a much smaller operator network, which then predicts the next state through time integration. Our framework decouples dynamics estimation (i.e., DISCovering an evolution operator from a short trajectory) from state prediction (i.e., evolving this operator). Experiments show that pretraining our model on diverse physics datasets achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer epochs. Moreover, it generalizes well and remains competitive when fine-tuned on downstream tasks.'}

Whether reasoning in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training."}

However, due to the variability of coordination goals, the complexity of the decision problem, and the time-consumption of trial-and-error in manual design, finding a well performance reward function to guide RL training to solve complex platoon coordination problems remains challenging. In this paper, we formally define the Platoon Coordination Reward Design Problem (PCRDP), extending the RL-based cooperative platoon coordination problem to incorporate automated reward function generation. To address PCRDP, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Platoon coordination Reward Design (PCRD) framework, which systematically automates reward function discovery through LLM-driven initialization and iterative optimization. In this method, LLM first initializes reward functions based on environment code and task requirements with an Analysis and Initial Reward (AIR) module, and then iteratively optimizes them based on training feedback with an evolutionary module. The AIR module guides LLM to deepen their understanding of code and tasks through a chain of thought, effectively mitigating hallucination risks in code generation. The evolutionary module fine-tunes and reconstructs the reward function, achieving a balance between exploration diversity and convergence stability for training. To validate our approach, we establish six challenging coordination scenarios with varying complexity levels within the Yangtze River Delta transportation network simulation. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that RL agents utilizing PCRD-generated reward functions consistently outperform human-engineered reward functions, achieving an average of 10\\% higher performance metrics in all scenarios.'}

Given the challenges in transforming stakeholder inputs into consistent software designs, Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) provides a systematic approach to handling free-form data. However, traditional QDA methods are time-consuming and heavily reliant on manual effort. In this paper, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, Mistral, and LLaMA-2, to improve QDA tasks in RE. Our study evaluates LLMs' performance in inductive (zero-shot) and deductive (one-shot, few-shot) annotation tasks, revealing that GPT-4 achieves substantial agreement with human analysts in deductive settings, with Cohen's Kappa scores exceeding 0.7, while zero-shot performance remains limited. Detailed, context-rich prompts significantly improve annotation accuracy and consistency, particularly in deductive scenarios, and GPT-4 demonstrates high reliability across repeated runs. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to support QDA in RE by reducing manual effort while maintaining annotation quality. The structured labels automatically provide traceability of requirements and can be directly utilized as classes in domain models, facilitating systematic software design."}

Label-specific features (LSFs), constructed by LIFT, have proven effective for learning tasks with label ambiguity by leveraging clustering-based prototypes for each label to re-characterize instances. However, directly introducing LIFT into LDL tasks can be suboptimal, as the prototypes it collects primarily reflect intra-cluster relationships while neglecting interactions among distinct clusters. Additionally, constructing LSFs using multi-perspective information, rather than relying solely on Euclidean distance, provides a more robust and comprehensive representation of instances, mitigating noise and bias that may arise from a single distance perspective. To address these limitations, we introduce Structural Anchor Points (SAPs) to capture inter-cluster interactions. This leads to a novel LSFs construction strategy, LIFT-SAP, which enhances LIFT by integrating both distance and direction information of each instance relative to SAPs. Furthermore, we propose a novel LDL algorithm, Label Distribution Learning via Label-specifIc FeaTure with SAPs (LDL-LIFT-SAP), which unifies multiple label description degrees predicted from different LSF spaces into a cohesive label distribution. Extensive experiments on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIFT-SAP over LIFT, as well as the superiority of LDL-LIFT-SAP compared to seven other well-established algorithms.'}

However, most existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion structures.

In this paper, we introduce Self-Play Critic (SPC), a novel approach where a critic model evolves its ability to assess reasoning steps through adversarial self-play games, eliminating the need for manual step-level annotation. SPC involves fine-tuning two copies of a base model to play two roles, namely a "sneaky generator" that deliberately produces erroneous steps designed to be difficult to detect, and a "critic" that analyzes the correctness of reasoning steps. These two models engage in an adversarial game in which the generator aims to fool the critic, while the critic model seeks to identify the generator\'s errors. Using reinforcement learning based on the game outcomes, the models iteratively improve; the winner of each confrontation receives a positive reward and the loser receives a negative reward, driving continuous self-evolution. Experiments on three reasoning process benchmarks (ProcessBench, PRM800K, DeltaBench) demonstrate that our SPC progressively enhances its error detection capabilities (e.g., accuracy increases from 70.8% to 77.7% on ProcessBench) and surpasses strong baselines, including distilled R1 model.

Based on the RL framework above, BQSched further introduces three optimization strategies, including adaptive masking to prune the action space, scheduling gain-based query clustering to deal with large query sets, and an incremental simulator to reduce sampling cost. To our knowledge, BQSched is the first non-intrusive batch query scheduler via RL. Extensive experiments show that BQSched can significantly improve the efficiency and stability of batch query scheduling, while also achieving remarkable scalability and adaptability in both data and queries. For example, across all DBMSs and scales tested, BQSched reduces the overall makespan of batch queries on TPC-DS benchmark by an average of 34% and 13%, compared with the commonly used heuristic strategy and the adapted RL-based scheduler, respectively.'}

Some risk-averse strategies, e.g., the conditional value-at-risk principle, are incorporated in domain randomization or meta reinforcement learning to prioritize difficult tasks in optimization, which demand costly intensive evaluations. The efficiency issue prompts the development of robust active task sampling to train adaptive policies, where risk-predictive models are used to surrogate policy evaluation. This work characterizes the optimization pipeline of robust active task sampling as a Markov decision process, posits theoretical and practical insights, and constitutes robustness concepts in risk-averse scenarios. Importantly, we propose an easy-to-implement method, referred to as Posterior and Diversity Synergized Task Sampling (PDTS), to accommodate fast and robust sequential decision-making.

Existing methods often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific) components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency, and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

This research addresses these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video snippets using a custom-made web platform.

The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases.

To address this gap, we introduce LawFlow, a dataset of complete end-to-end legal workflows collected from trained law students, grounded in real-world business entity formation scenarios. Unlike prior datasets focused on input-output pairs or linear chains of thought, LawFlow captures dynamic, modular, and iterative reasoning processes that reflect the ambiguity, revision, and client-adaptive strategies of legal practice. Using LawFlow, we compare human and LLM-generated workflows, revealing systematic differences in structure, reasoning flexibility, and plan execution. Human workflows tend to be modular and adaptive, while LLM workflows are more sequential, exhaustive, and less sensitive to downstream implications. Our findings also suggest that legal professionals prefer AI to carry out supportive roles, such as brainstorming, identifying blind spots, and surfacing alternatives, rather than executing complex workflows end-to-end.

This shortfall often leads to chain reaction collisions in high speed, densely spaced traffic particularly when a middle vehicle suddenly brakes and trailing vehicles cannot respond in time. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel longitudinal control and collision avoidance algorithm that integrates adaptive cruising with emergency braking. Leveraging deep reinforcement learning, our method simultaneously accounts for both leading and following vehicles. Through a data preprocessing framework that calibrates real-world sensor data, we enhance the robustness and reliability of the training process, ensuring the learned policy can handle diverse driving conditions. In simulated high risk scenarios (e.g., emergency braking in dense traffic), the algorithm effectively prevents potential pile up collisions, even in situations involving heavy duty vehicles. Furthermore, in typical highway scenarios where three vehicles decelerate, the proposed DRL approach achieves a 99% success rate far surpassing the standard Federal Highway Administration speed concepts guide, which reaches only 36.77% success under the same conditions.'}

In the past, we have typically taken the target distribution as a criterion to evaluate a model's compression performance. Nevertheless,it often remains challenging to precisely assess how well the model achieves compression and to compare the information content of the learned distribution with that of the target distribution during compression,as the target distribution is typically unknown and entropy computation often incurs exponential cost. In this work, we explore these issues under a controlled experimental setup. We find that Transformers exhibit a unique inductive bias in data compression: beyond approaching the target distribution, they tend to favor learning lower-entropy distributions, with this tendency becoming more pronounced as the model size increases. This preference prevents Transformers from perfectly aligning with the target distribution, instead further compressing its information content. Furthermore, we show that the FFN module plays a critical role in driving this bias. In addition, while models remove informational redundancy from data during compression, they also exhibit redundancy within their parameters, which enables compression and can be characterized through dynamic sparsity. However, the dynamic sparsity patterns in Transformers, particularly in attention and FFN modules, demand further exploration. As for this, we show that larger Transformers show stronger preferences for bypassing attention computations via residual connections and have lower proportion of active neurons. Interestingly, we also find that training instability in larger models strongly correlates with sudden increases in dead neurons. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding of Transformers from the lens of entropy and dynamic sparsity."}

Many organizations employ FL to have better privacy-aware ML-driven decision-making capabilities. However, organizations often operate independently rather than collaborate to enhance their FL capabilities due to the lack of an effective mechanism for collaboration. The challenge lies in balancing trust and resource efficiency. One approach relies on trusting a third-party aggregator to consolidate models from all organizations (multilevel FL), but this requires trusting an entity that may be biased or unreliable. Alternatively, organizations can bypass a third party by sharing their local models directly, which requires significant computational resources for validation. Both approaches reflect a fundamental trade-off between trust and resource constraints, with neither offering an ideal solution. In this work, we develop a trust-based cross-silo FL framework called \\proj, which uses decentralized orchestration and distributed storage. \\proj provides flexibility to the participating organizations and presents synchronous and asynchronous modes to handle stragglers. Our evaluation on a diverse testbed shows that \\proj achieves a performance comparable to the ideal multilevel centralized FL while allowing trust and optimal use of resources.'}

VNFs are software-based counterparts of traditional hardware devices that facilitate flexible and scalable service provisioning.

Nevertheless, partitioning SFCs across multi-domain network infrastructures presents substantial challenges due to stringent latency constraints and limited resource availability. Conventional optimization-based methods typically exhibit low scalability, whereas existing data-driven approaches often fail to adequately balance computational efficiency with the capability to effectively account for dependencies inherent in SFCs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Transformer-empowered actor-critic framework specifically designed for sequence-aware SFC partitioning.

It provides an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).\nMethod: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.

Data were grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error distributions.\nResults: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50% with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%. Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over 50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates (~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability (10-50%).

In this work, we propose Dimension-Wise Positional Embeddings Manipulation (DPE), a training-free framework to extrapolate the context window of LLMs by diving into RoPE's different hidden dimensions. Instead of manipulating all dimensions equally, DPE detects the effective length for every dimension and finds the key dimensions for context extension. We reuse the original position indices with their embeddings from the pre-trained model and manipulate the key dimensions' position indices to their most effective lengths. In this way, DPE adjusts the pre-trained models with minimal modifications while ensuring that each dimension reaches its optimal state for extrapolation. DPE significantly surpasses well-known baselines such as YaRN and Self-Extend. DPE enables Llama3-8k 8B to support context windows of 128k tokens without continual training and integrates seamlessly with Flash Attention 2. In addition to its impressive extrapolation capability, DPE also dramatically improves the models' performance within training length, such as Llama3.1 70B, by over 18 points on popular long-context benchmarks RULER.

For materials with complex microstructures, such as two-phase random materials (TRMs), material failure is often accompanied by stress concentration. Phase interfaces in two-phase materials are critical for stress concentration. Therefore, the prediction error of stress at phase boundaries is crucial. In practical engineering, the pixels of the obtained material microstructure images are limited, which limits the resolution of stress images generated by deep learning methods, making it difficult to observe stress concentration regions. Existing Image Super-Resolution (ISR) technologies are all based on data-driven supervised learning. However, stress images have natural physical constraints, which provide new ideas for new ISR technologies. In this study, we constructed a stress prediction framework for TRMs. First, the framework uses a proposed Multiple Compositions U-net (MC U-net) to predict stress in low-resolution material microstructures. By considering the phase interface information of the microstructure, the MC U-net effectively reduces the problem of excessive prediction errors at phase boundaries. Secondly, a Mixed Physics-Informed Neural Network (MPINN) based method for stress ISR (SRPINN) was proposed. By introducing the constraints of physical information, the new method does not require paired stress images for training and can increase the resolution of stress images to any multiple. This enables a multiscale analysis of the stress concentration regions at phase boundaries. Finally, we performed stress analysis on TRMs with different phase volume fractions and loading states through transfer learning. The results show the proposed stress prediction framework has satisfactory accuracy and generalization ability.'}

This research aims to address this limitation by proposing a method for enforcing stationary behaviour within the latent space while preserving trend and seasonal information. The method deploys techniques including Differencing, Time-series decomposition, and Latent Space Arithmetic (LSA), to learn information vital for efficient approximation of trend and seasonal information which is then stored as embeddings within the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE).

Objective. In this paper, we investigate whether students prompts can be systematically analyzed using propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can identify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide insights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce Prompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into logical constraints.

We used this approach to analyze a dataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming tasks. Findings.

This paper addresses a fundamental dilemma posed by AI decision-support systems: the risk of either becoming overwhelmed by complex decisions, thus losing agency, or having autonomy compromised by externally controlled choice architectures reminiscent of ``nudging'' practices. While the ``nudge'' framework, based on the use of choice-framing to guide individuals toward presumed beneficial outcomes, initially appeared to preserve liberty, at AI-driven scale, it threatens to erode autonomy. To counteract this risk, the paper proposes a philosophic turn in AI design. AI should be constructed to facilitate decentralized truth-seeking and open-ended inquiry, mirroring the Socratic method of philosophical dialogue. By promoting individual and collective adaptive learning, such AI systems would empower users to maintain control over their judgments, augmenting their agency without undermining autonomy. The paper concludes by outlining essential features for autonomy-preserving AI systems, sketching a path toward AI systems that enhance human judgment rather than undermine it."}

Existing explorations of this threat applied to web agents often focus on a single isolated adversarial goal, test with injected instructions that are either too easy or not truly malicious, and often give the adversary unreasonable access. In order to better focus adversarial research, we construct a new benchmark called WASP (Web Agent Security against Prompt injection attacks) that introduces realistic web agent hijacking objectives and an isolated environment to test them in that does not affect real users or the live web.

Based on these findings, we argue that adversarial researchers should demonstrate stronger attacks that more consistently maintain control over the agent given realistic constraints on the adversary's power."}

In this work, we examine how such in-context retrieval operates within Transformer- and SSM-based language models. We find that both architectures develop the same fundamental Gather-and-Aggregate (G&A) mechanism. A Gather Head first identifies and extracts relevant information from the context, which an Aggregate Head then integrates into a final representation. Across both model types, G&A concentrates in just a few heads, making them critical bottlenecks even for benchmarks that require a basic form of retrieval. For example, disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head of a pruned Llama-3.1-8B degrades its ability to retrieve the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing accuracy from 66% to 25%. This finding suggests that in-context retrieval can obscure the limited knowledge demands of certain tasks. Despite strong MMLU performance with retrieval intact, the pruned model fails on other knowledge tests. Similar G&A dependencies exist in GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue tasks. Given the significance of G&A in performance, we show that retrieval challenges in SSMs manifest in how they implement G&A, leading to smoother attention patterns rather than the sharp token transitions that effective G&A relies on. Thus, while a gap exists between Transformers and SSMs in implementing in-context retrieval, it is confined to a few heads, not the entire model. This insight suggests a unified explanation for performance differences between Transformers and SSMs while also highlighting ways to combine their strengths. For example, in pretrained hybrid models, attention components naturally take on the role of Aggregate Heads. Similarly, in a pretrained pure SSM, replacing a single G&A head with an attention-based variant significantly improves retrieval.'}

Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing patient privacy protection."}

The complexity of such attacks, often hidden within high-dimensional and redundant network traffic data, necessitates robust and intelligent feature selection techniques for effective detection. Traditional methods such as filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded approaches, each offer strengths but struggle with scalability or adaptability in complex attack environments. In this study, we explore these existing techniques through a detailed comparative analysis and highlight their limitations when applied to large-scale DDoS detection tasks. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Network-based Feature Selection (GANFS) method that leverages adversarial learning dynamics to identify the most informative features. By training a GAN exclusively on attack traffic and employing a perturbation-based sensitivity analysis on the Discriminator, GANFS effectively ranks feature importance without relying on full supervision. Experimental evaluations using the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset demonstrate that GANFS not only improves the accuracy of downstream classifiers but also enhances computational efficiency by significantly reducing feature dimensionality. These results point to the potential of integrating generative learning models into cybersecurity pipelines to build more adaptive and scalable detection systems.'}

To better understand this risk, we introduce RepliBench, a suite of evaluations designed to measure autonomous replication capabilities. RepliBench is derived from a decomposition of these capabilities covering four core domains: obtaining resources, exfiltrating model weights, replicating onto compute, and persisting on this compute for long periods. We create 20 novel task families consisting of 86 individual tasks. We benchmark 5 frontier models, and find they do not currently pose a credible threat of self-replication, but succeed on many components and are improving rapidly. Models can deploy instances from cloud compute providers, write self-propagating programs, and exfiltrate model weights under simple security setups, but struggle to pass KYC checks or set up robust and persistent agent deployments. Overall the best model we evaluated (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) has a >50% pass@10 score on 15/20 task families, and a >50% pass@10 score for 9/20 families on the hardest variants. These findings suggest autonomous replication capability could soon emerge with improvements in these remaining areas or with human assistance.'}

Therefore, in this paper, we propose DualBreach, a target-driven framework for dual-jailbreaking. DualBreach employs a Target-driven Initialization (TDI) strategy to dynamically construct initial prompts, combined with a Multi-Target Optimization (MTO) method that utilizes approximate gradients to jointly adapt the prompts across guardrails and LLMs, which can simultaneously save the number of queries and achieve a high dual-jailbreaking success rate. For black-box guardrails, DualBreach either employs a powerful open-sourced guardrail or imitates the target black-box guardrail by training a proxy model, to incorporate guardrails into the MTO process.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of DualBreach in dual-jailbreaking scenarios through extensive evaluation on several widely-used datasets. Experimental results indicate that DualBreach outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer queries, achieving significantly higher success rates across all settings. More specifically, DualBreach achieves an average dual-jailbreaking success rate of 93.67% against GPT-4 with Llama-Guard-3 protection, whereas the best success rate achieved by other methods is 88.33%. Moreover, DualBreach only uses an average of 1.77 queries per successful dual-jailbreak, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. For the purpose of defense, we propose an XGBoost-based ensemble defensive mechanism named EGuard, which integrates the strengths of multiple guardrails, demonstrating superior performance compared with Llama-Guard-3.'}

While classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms, generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy. Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable, and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against backdoor attacks."}

This work harnesses that internal world for wildfire occurrence prediction by introducing a modular architecture built upon Gemma 3, a state-of-the-art multimodal model. Rather than relying on Gemma 3\'s original embedding and positional encoding stacks, we develop a custom feed-forward module that transforms tabular wildfire features into the hidden dimension required by Gemma 3\'s mid-layer Transformer blocks. We freeze these Gemma 3 sub-layers -- thus preserving their pretrained representation power -- while training only the smaller input and output networks. This approach minimizes the number of trainable parameters and reduces the risk of overfitting on limited wildfire data, yet retains the benefits of Gemma 3\'s broad knowledge. Evaluations on a Moroccan wildfire dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and robustness compared to standard feed-forward and convolutional baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the frozen Transformer layers consistently contribute to better representations, underscoring the feasibility of reusing large-model mid-layers as a learned internal world. Our findings suggest that strategic modular reuse of pretrained Transformers can enable more data-efficient and interpretable solutions for critical environmental applications such as wildfire risk management.'}

Currently, methods of evaluating adversarial robustness are primarily categorized into attack-based and certified robustness evaluation approaches. The former not only relies on specific attack algorithms but also is highly time-consuming, while the latter due to its analytical nature, is typically difficult to implement for large and complex models. A few studies evaluate model robustness based on the model's decision boundary, but they suffer from low evaluation accuracy. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel adversarial robustness evaluation metric, Robustness Difference Index (RDI), which is based on sample clustering features. RDI draws inspiration from clustering evaluation by analyzing the intra-class and inter-class distances of feature vectors separated by the decision boundary to quantify model robustness. It is attack-independent and has high computational efficiency. Experiments show that, RDI demonstrates a stronger correlation with the gold-standard adversarial robustness metric of attack success rate (ASR). The average computation time of RDI is only 1/30 of the evaluation method based on the PGD attack. Our open-source code is available at: this https URL."}
