We present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation, code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task, utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns, vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation; speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late, elaborative this http URL, the framework and metrics make iteration measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or switch strategies."}

Evaluation capabilities that currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes, and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason, probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement. Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized Evaluators to assess not only the system\'s components but also the quality of the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system\'s failure. RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.'}

This paper introduces \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space, enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics benchmarks. \\texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\\% and 41.4\\% on the MiniF2F and ProofNet test sets respectively.

With the growth of Smart and Connected Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives: maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period (sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy, consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49 US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning. Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others. LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are needed for reliable practice.'}

To address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.

This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations.

Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows.

To mitigate this issue, we conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery, we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints, allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between conciseness and correctness.

Yet the rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer. Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24.

Hastings, David Kenley', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06920', 'abstract': 'Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.'}

Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result, current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\\% of the model loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance at a faster pace and thus achieve \\emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}."}

Lungren, Thomas Osborne', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06602', 'abstract': "Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary, typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon, or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs."}

Recent fine-grained MoE designs introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training, plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference acceleration without retraining or architectural changes.

Experimental results reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics.

However, conventional methods for constructing such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.

Exhaustive testing of all input combinations is impractical, often resulting in undetected failures, high manual effort, and limited test coverage. To address these issues, we introduce RestTSLLM, an approach that uses Test Specification Language (TSL) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of test cases for REST APIs. The approach targets two core challenges: the creation of test scenarios and the definition of appropriate input data. The proposed solution integrates prompt engineering techniques with an automated pipeline to evaluate various LLMs on their ability to generate tests from OpenAPI specifications. The evaluation focused on metrics such as success rate, test coverage, and mutation score, enabling a systematic comparison of model performance. The results indicate that the best-performing LLMs - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic), Deepseek R1 (Deepseek), Qwen 2.5 32b (Alibaba), and Sabia 3 (Maritaca) - consistently produced robust and contextually coherent REST API tests. Among them, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed all other models across every metric, emerging in this study as the most suitable model for this task. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to automate the generation of tests based on API specifications.'}

Bissyandé', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05553', 'abstract': 'This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue, they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples. This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for developing more capable AI systems.'}

Our work offers a complementary perspective to these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations, rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential membership inference signals. Our framework, \\emph{memTrace}, follows what we call \\enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.

The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk.

However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions, raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states, which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training, which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance. Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety research."}

Our evaluation combines automatic metrics, LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages. These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual commonsense generation.

Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated baselines.'}

Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters, limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of Tasks setting.'}

While adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs, they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model.'}

Prior work has proposed representing a method as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse. However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore, we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.'}

In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization. Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer.

Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.'}

To this end, we develop a study designed to (a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model families and at differing model sizes.

Accurate classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels, but their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used because they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often contain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels (FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by carefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly manual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse items. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation Learning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with large language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL dataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier finds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our experiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored item feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In contrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the improvement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.

To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset (NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking.
