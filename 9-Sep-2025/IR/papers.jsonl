Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch, a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences. Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world applications."}

While large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been assessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves, long-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they remain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To bridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the reasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i) it breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture user intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic interpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it independently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion strategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a large-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine and distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into smaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR demonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse and dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness.'}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries. This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness, which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset (NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG performance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while maintaining competitive accuracy.'}

Search is often the first entry point for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to support users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically, we would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search by topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and publishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more exploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to better deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a cold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little amount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available items such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose AudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via synthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic queries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search Retrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time. We show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase retrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B test show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in audiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions."}

We address this challenge by modeling the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions. Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.'}

In this survey, we provide a systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale, real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions, including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger collaboration between industry and academia."}

Although several paradigms (seed selection, incremental insertion, neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer) have been employed to design in-memory graph-based vector search algorithms, a systematic comparison of the key algorithmic advances is still missing. We conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g., the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the importance of devising more sophisticated data adaptive seed selection and diversification strategies.'}

This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints, and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale, real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search systems.'}

Accurate classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels, but their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used because they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often contain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels (FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by carefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly manual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse items. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation Learning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with large language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL dataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier finds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our experiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored item feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In contrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the improvement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy. These contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's knowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that adjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD)."}

Furthermore, an analysis based on user-assigned genre tags quantitatively demonstrates that between 2005 and 2010, K-pop shed its status as a local Asian genre and established itself as a distinct music genre in its own right.'}
