Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\\_QA dataset show that our hybrid approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling, and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance, advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial scenarios.'}

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, but these methods may introduce irrelevant retrieved documents, leading to inaccurate responses. While the integration methods filter out incorrect answers from multiple responses, but lack external knowledge like RAG methods, and their high costs require balancing overhead with performance gains. To address these issues, we propose an Efficient Test-Time Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework named ET2RAG to improve the performance of LLMs while maintaining efficiency. Specifically, ET2RAG is a training-free method, that first retrieves the most relevant documents and augments the LLMs to efficiently generate diverse candidate responses by managing response length. Then we compute the similarity of candidate responses and employ a majority voting mechanism to select the most suitable response as the final output. In particular, we discover that partial generation is sufficient to capture the key information necessary for consensus calculation, allowing us to effectively perform majority voting without the need for fully generated responses. Thus, we can reach a balance between computational cost and performance by managing the response length for the number of retrieved documents for majority voting. Experimental results demonstrate that ET2RAG significantly enhances performance across three tasks, including open-domain question answering, recipe generation and image captioning.'}

To address this, we introduce CLAUSE, a first-of-its-kind benchmark designed to evaluate the fragility of an LLM's legal reasoning. We study the capabilities of LLMs to detect and reason about fine-grained discrepancies by producing over 7500 real-world perturbed contracts from foundational datasets like CUAD and ContractNLI. Our novel, persona-driven pipeline generates 10 distinct anomaly categories, which are then validated against official statutes using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to ensure legal fidelity. We use CLAUSE to evaluate leading LLMs' ability to detect embedded legal flaws and explain their significance. Our analysis shows a key weakness: these models often miss subtle errors and struggle even more to justify them legally. Our work outlines a path to identify and correct such reasoning failures in legal AI."}

We introduce RAGSmith, a modular framework that treats RAG design as an end-to-end architecture search over nine technique families and 46{,}080 feasible pipeline configurations. A genetic search optimizes a scalar objective that jointly aggregates retrieval metrics (recall@k, mAP, nDCG, MRR) and generation metrics (LLM-Judge and semantic similarity). We evaluate on six Wikipedia-derived domains (Mathematics, Law, Finance, Medicine, Defense Industry, Computer Science), each with 100 questions spanning factual, interpretation, and long-answer types. RAGSmith finds configurations that consistently outperform naive RAG baseline by +3.8\\% on average (range +1.2\\% to +6.9\\% across domains), with gains up to +12.5\\% in retrieval and +7.5\\% in generation. The search typically explores $\\approx 0.2\\%$ of the space ($\\sim 100$ candidates) and discovers a robust backbone -- vector retrieval plus post-generation reflection/revision -- augmented by domain-dependent choices in expansion, reranking, augmentation, and prompt reordering; passage compression is never selected. Improvement magnitude correlates with question type, with larger gains on factual/long-answer mixes than interpretation-heavy sets. These results provide practical, domain-aware guidance for assembling effective RAG systems and demonstrate the utility of evolutionary search for full-pipeline optimization.'}

Answering expert-level questions about 5G specifications requires navigating thousands of pages of cross-referenced standards that evolve across releases. Existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, including telecom-specific approaches, rely on semantic similarity and cannot reliably resolve cross-references or reason about specification evolution. We present DeepSpecs, a RAG system enhanced by structural and temporal reasoning via three metadata-rich databases: SpecDB (clause-aligned specification text), ChangeDB (line-level version diffs), and TDocDB (standardization meeting documents). DeepSpecs explicitly resolves cross-references by recursively retrieving referenced clauses through metadata lookup, and traces specification evolution by mining changes and linking them to Change Requests that document design rationale. We curate two 5G QA datasets: 573 expert-annotated real-world questions from practitioner forums and educational resources, and 350 evolution-focused questions derived from approved Change Requests. Across multiple LLM backends, DeepSpecs outperforms base models and state-of-the-art telecom RAG systems; ablations confirm that explicit cross-reference resolution and evolution-aware retrieval substantially improve answer quality, underscoring the value of modeling the structural and temporal properties of 5G standards.'}

Despite their versatility, LLMs face notable challenges, such as generating hallucinated content and lacking access to up-to-date information. Lately, to address such limitations, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising direction by generating responses grounded in external knowledge sources. A typical RAG system consists of i) a retriever that probes a group of relevant passages from a knowledge base and ii) a generator that formulates a response based on the retrieved content. However, as with other AI systems, recent studies demonstrate the vulnerability of RAG, such as knowledge corruption attacks by injecting misleading information. In response, several defense strategies have been proposed, including having LLMs inspect the retrieved passages individually or fine-tuning robust retrievers. While effective, such approaches often come with substantial computational costs.\nIn this work, we introduce RAGDefender, a resource-efficient defense mechanism against knowledge corruption (i.e., by data poisoning) attacks in practical RAG deployments. RAGDefender operates during the post-retrieval phase, leveraging lightweight machine learning techniques to detect and filter out adversarial content without requiring additional model training or inference. Our empirical evaluations show that RAGDefender consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses across multiple models and adversarial scenarios: e.g., RAGDefender reduces the attack success rate (ASR) against the Gemini model from 0.89 to as low as 0.02, compared to 0.69 for RobustRAG and 0.24 for Discern-and-Answer when adversarial passages outnumber legitimate ones by a factor of four (4x).'}

This paper introduces a reproducible draft-based refinement pipeline that elevates open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to a performance level statistically comparable to top-tier proprietary systems. Our method first uses a fine-tuned NLLB-1.3B model to generate a high-quality, structurally faithful draft. A zero-shot LLM (Llama-3.3 or Qwen3) then polishes this draft, a process that can be further enhanced by augmenting the context with retrieved out-context examples (RAG). We demonstrate the robustness of this approach on two distinct benchmarks: a standard in-domain test set (Rosenthal, 2023) and a new, challenging out-of-domain (OOD) set of 12th-century Latin letters (2025). Our central finding is that this open-source RAG system achieves performance statistically comparable to the GPT-5 baseline, without any task-specific LLM fine-tuning. We release the pipeline, the Chartres OOD set, and evaluation scripts and models to facilitate replicability and further research.'}

On the other hand, the redundant knowledge in the external corpus is not helpful to LLMs and our exploratory analysis shows that it instead hurts the RAG performance on those questions which the LLM can answer by itself. To address these issues, we propose Zero-RAG to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we first propose the Mastery-Score metric to identify redundant knowledge in the RAG corpus to prune it. After pruning, answers to "mastered" questions rely primarily on internal knowledge of the LLM. To better harness the internal capacity, we propose Query Router and Noise-Tolerant Tuning to avoid the irrelevant documents\' distraction and thus further improve the LLM\'s utilization of internal knowledge with pruned corpus. Experimental results show that Zero-RAG prunes the Wikipedia corpus by 30\\% and accelerates the retrieval stage by 22\\%, without compromising RAG\'s performance.'}
