By integrating advanced probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning. Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to support user trust and clinical interpretability.

AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.\nIn this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk."}

To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems.

Applications like e-commerce, healthcare, recommendation systems, and various social media platforms are rapidly moving towards graph representation of data due to their ability to capture both structural and attribute information. One crucial task in graph analysis is node classification, where unlabeled nodes are categorized into predefined classes. In practice, novel classes appear incrementally sometimes with just a few labels (seen classes) or even without any labels (unseen classes), either because they are new or haven't been explored much. Traditional methods assume abundant labeled data for training, which isn't always feasible. We investigate a broader objective: \\emph{Graph Class Incremental Learning under Weak Supervision (GCL)}, addressing this challenge by meta-training on base classes with limited labeled instances. During the incremental streams, novel classes can have few-shot or zero-shot representation. Our proposed framework GOTHAM efficiently accommodates these unlabeled nodes by finding the closest prototype representation, serving as class representatives in the attribute space. For Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), our framework additionally incorporates semantic information to enhance the representation. By employing teacher-student knowledge distillation to mitigate forgetting, GOTHAM achieves promising results across various tasks.

Collecting human feedback is both expensive and time-consuming, and manual labels can be noisy, leading to an imbalance between helpfulness and harmfulness. Constitutional AI, introduced by Anthropic in December 2022, uses AI to provide feedback to another AI, greatly reducing the need for human labeling. However, the original implementation was designed for a model with around 52 billion parameters, and there is limited information on how well Constitutional AI performs with smaller models, such as LLaMA 3-8B. In this paper, we replicated the Constitutional AI workflow using the smaller LLaMA 3-8B model. Our results show that Constitutional AI can effectively increase the harmlessness of the model, reducing the Attack Success Rate in MT-Bench by 40.8%. However, similar to the original study, increasing harmlessness comes at the cost of helpfulness. The helpfulness metrics, which are an average of the Turn 1 and Turn 2 scores, dropped by 9.8% compared to the baseline. Additionally, we observed clear signs of model collapse in the final DPO-CAI model, indicating that smaller models may struggle with self-improvement due to insufficient output quality, making effective fine-tuning more challenging.

While hierarchical planning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) address some of these challenges, they remain insufficient on their own and a deeper integration is required for achieving more reliable systems. To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in pattern recognition and response generation, they lack genuine understanding - an essential hallmark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Existing AGI evaluation methods fail to offer a practical, gradual, and informative metric. This paper introduces the Artificial General Intelligence Test Bed (AGITB), comprising twelve rigorous tests that form a signal-processing-level foundation for the potential emergence of cognitive capabilities. AGITB evaluates intelligence through a model's ability to predict binary signals across time without relying on symbolic representations or pretraining. Unlike high-level tests grounded in language or perception, AGITB focuses on core computational invariants reflective of biological intelligence, such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalisation. The test bed assumes no prior bias, operates independently of semantic meaning, and ensures unsolvability through brute force or memorization. While humans pass AGITB by design, no current AI system has met its criteria, making AGITB a compelling benchmark for guiding and recognizing progress toward AGI."}

Supervised fine-tuning on such reasoning traces, also known as distillation, can be a cost-effective way to boost reasoning capabilities of student models. However, empirical observations reveal that these reasoning trajectories are often suboptimal, switching excessively between different lines of thought, resulting in under-thinking, over-thinking, and even degenerate responses. We introduce Retro-Search, an MCTS-inspired search algorithm, for distilling higher quality reasoning paths from large reasoning models. Retro-Search retrospectively revises reasoning paths to discover better, yet shorter traces, which can then lead to student models with enhanced reasoning capabilities with shorter, thus faster inference. Our approach can enable two use cases: self-improvement, where models are fine-tuned on their own Retro-Search-ed thought traces, and weak-to-strong improvement, where a weaker model revises stronger model's thought traces via Retro-Search. For self-improving, R1-distill-7B, fine-tuned on its own Retro-Search-ed traces, reduces the average reasoning length by 31.2% while improving performance by 7.7% across seven math benchmarks. For weak-to-strong improvement, we retrospectively revise R1-671B's traces from the OpenThoughts dataset using R1-distill-32B as the Retro-Search-er, a model 20x smaller. Qwen2.5-32B, fine-tuned on this refined data, achieves performance comparable to R1-distill-32B, yielding an 11.3% reduction in reasoning length and a 2.4% performance improvement compared to fine-tuning on the original OpenThoughts data.

Specifically, among these, the fine-tuned CatBoost model demonstrated the best overall performance having an accuracy of 98.75%, an AUC of 0.9993 and a Kappa score of 97.35% of the studies.

On one hand, the ICEF introduces the fusion result into credibility assessment to establish the correlation between credibility and the fusion result. On the other hand, arithmetic-geometric divergence is promoted based on the exponential normalization of plausibility and belief functions to measure evidence conflict, called plausibility-belief arithmetic-geometric divergence (PBAGD), which is superior in capturing the correlation and difference of FOD subsets, identifying abnormal sources, and reducing their fusion weights. The ICEF is compared with traditional methods by combining different evidence difference measure forms via numerical examples to verify its performance. Simulations on numerical examples and benchmark datasets reflect the adaptability of PBAGD to the proposed fusion strategy."}

Current research on KT modeling focuses on predicting student' future performance based on existing, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these approaches ignore the distractors (such as slipping and guessing) in the answering process and overlook that static cognitive representations are temporary and limited. Most of them assume that there are no distractors in the answering process and that the record representations fully represent the students' level of understanding and proficiency in knowledge. In this case, it may lead to many insynergy and incoordination issue in the original records. Therefore we propose a Cognitive Representation Optimization for Knowledge Tracing (CRO-KT) model, which utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize structure of cognitive representations. This ensures that the structure matches the students' cognitive patterns in terms of the difficulty of the exercises. Furthermore, we use the co-optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representations of the sub-target exercises in terms of the overall situation of exercises responses by considering all the exercises with co-relationships as a single goal. Meanwhile, the CRO-KT model fuses the learned relational embeddings from the bipartite graph with the optimized record representations in a weighted manner, enhancing the expression of students' cognition.

Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive pre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material inference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and verifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as a promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new opportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we introduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and formal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this framework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in natural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via interaction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic provers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure the quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic dimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony. While PEIRCE is a general-purpose framework, we demonstrate its capabilities in the domain of natural language explanation generation - a setting that inherently demands both material adequacy and formal correctness."}

While deep supervision has been widely applied for task-specific learning, our focus is on improving the world models. Using an experimental environment based on the Flappy Bird game, where the agent receives only LIDAR measurements as observations, we explore the effect of adding a linear probe component to the network's loss function. This additional term encourages the network to encode a subset of the true underlying world features into its hidden state. Our experiments demonstrate that this supervision technique improves both training and test performance, enhances training stability, and results in more easily decodable world features -- even for those world features which were not included in the training. Furthermore, we observe a reduced distribution drift in networks trained with the linear probe, particularly during high-variability phases of the game (flying between successive pipe encounters). Including the world features loss component roughly corresponded to doubling the model size, suggesting that the linear probe technique is particularly beneficial in compute-limited settings or when aiming to achieve the best performance with smaller models. These findings contribute to our understanding of how to develop more robust and sophisticated world models in artificial agents, paving the way for further advancements in this field."}

Duplicate reports are separate and unlinked reports referring to the same case of an adverse event involving a specific patient at a certain time.

This paper builds upon a hitherto state of the art model, vigiMatch, modifying existing features and introducing new ones to target known shortcomings of the original model. Two support vector machine classifiers, one for medicines and one for vaccines, classify report pairs as duplicates and non-duplicates. Recall was measured using a diverse collection of 5 independent labelled test sets. Precision was measured by having each model classify a randomly selected stream of pairs of reports until each model classified 100 pairs as duplicates. These pairs were assessed by a medical doctor without indicating which method(s) had flagged each pair. Performance on individual countries was measured by having a medical doctor assess a subset of pairs classified as duplicates for three different countries. The new model achieved higher precision and higher recall for all labelled datasets compared to the previous state of the art model, with comparable performance for medicines and vaccines. The model was shown to produce substantially fewer false positives than the comparator model on pairs from individual countries.

Few-shot KG completion aims to make accurate predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a limited number of training triplets are available. Although many methods have been proposed, they typically learn each relation individually, overlooking the correlations between different tasks and the relevant information in previously trained tasks. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based few-shot KG completion method (TransNet). By learning the relationships between different tasks, TransNet effectively transfers knowledge from similar tasks to improve the current task's performance. Furthermore, by employing meta-learning, TransNet can generalize effectively to new, unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of TransNet over state-of-the-art methods. Code can be found at this https URL"}

In an attempt to provide an answer to this particular problem, a condition detection and diagnosis method combining clustering algorithms and autoencoder neural networks for pattern recognition has been developed and is presented in this paper. First, a dimension reduction algorithm is used to create a 2-or 3-dimensional projection that allows the users to identify unsuspected relationships between datapoints. Then, a collection of clustering algorithms regroups the datapoints into clusters. For each identified cluster, an autoencoder neural network is trained on the corresponding dataset.

To address the need for detailed region-level understanding, we introduce URECA dataset, a large-scale dataset tailored for multi-granularity region captioning. Unlike prior datasets that focus primarily on salient objects, URECA dataset ensures a unique and consistent mapping between regions and captions by incorporating a diverse set of objects, parts, and background elements. Central to this is a stage-wise data curation pipeline, where each stage incrementally refines region selection and caption generation. By leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) at each stage, our pipeline produces distinctive and contextually grounded captions with improved accuracy and semantic diversity. Building upon this dataset, we present URECA, a novel captioning model designed to effectively encode multi-granularity regions. URECA maintains essential spatial properties such as position and shape through simple yet impactful modifications to existing MLLMs, enabling fine-grained and semantically rich region descriptions.

As there are various reasons the classifier might lose confidence, it would be valuable for this model to not only indicate its level of uncertainty but also explain why it is uncertain. Counterfactual images have been used to visualize changes that could be made to an image to generate a different classification decision. In this work, we explore the use of counterfactuals to offer an explanation for low model competency--a generalized form of predictive uncertainty that measures confidence. Toward this end, we develop five novel methods to generate high-competency counterfactual images, namely Image Gradient Descent (IGD), Feature Gradient Descent (FGD), Autoencoder Reconstruction (Reco), Latent Gradient Descent (LGD), and Latent Nearest Neighbors (LNN). We evaluate these methods across two unique datasets containing images with six known causes for low model competency and find Reco, LGD, and LNN to be the most promising methods for counterfactual generation. We further evaluate how these three methods can be utilized by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate language explanations for low model competency. We find that the inclusion of a counterfactual image in the language model query greatly increases the ability of the model to generate an accurate explanation for the cause of low model competency, thus demonstrating the utility of counterfactual images in explaining low perception model competency.'}

To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs\' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.'}

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown compelling semantic understanding capabilities and are appealing to researchers studying dense retrieval. LLMs, as decoder-style generative models, are competent at language generation while falling short on modeling global information due to the lack of attention to tokens afterward. Inspired by the classical word-based language modeling approach for IR, i.e., the query likelihood (QL) model, we seek to sufficiently utilize LLMs' generative ability by QL maximization. However, instead of ranking documents with QL estimation, we introduce an auxiliary task of QL maximization to yield a better backbone for contrastively learning a discriminative retriever. We name our model as LLM-QL. To condense global document semantics to a single vector during QL modeling, LLM-QL has two major components, Attention Stop (AS) and Input Corruption (IC). AS stops the attention of predictive tokens to previous tokens until the ending token of the document. IC masks a portion of tokens in the input documents during prediction. Experiments on MSMARCO show that LLM-QL can achieve significantly better performance than other LLM-based retrievers and using QL estimated by LLM-QL for ranking outperforms word-based QL by a large margin."}

To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML systems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability. Some scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical challenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however, little attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the ML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and AI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity into ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users cannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour of an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive epistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem in ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies may be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more directly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and update compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks or carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address the epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update opacity going forward.'}

Despite its promising potential, the adoption of multimodal sensing-aided beam prediction is hindered by high computational complexity, high costs, and limited datasets. Thus, in this paper, a resource-efficient learning approach is proposed to transfer knowledge from a multimodal network to a monomodal (radar-only) network based on cross-modal relational knowledge distillation (CRKD), while reducing computational overhead and preserving predictive accuracy. To enable multimodal learning with realistic data, a novel multimodal simulation framework is developed while integrating sensor data generated from the autonomous driving simulator CARLA with MATLAB-based mmWave channel modeling, and reflecting real-world conditions. The proposed CRKD achieves its objective by distilling relational information across different feature spaces, which enhances beam prediction performance without relying on expensive sensor data. Simulation results demonstrate that CRKD efficiently distills multimodal knowledge, allowing a radar-only model to achieve $94.62\\%$ of the teacher performance. In particular, this is achieved with just $10\\%$ of the teacher network's parameters, thereby significantly reducing computational complexity and dependence on multimodal sensor data."}

While reinforcement learning-based methods, such as reinforcement learning from relevance feedback (RLRF), aim to address this misalignment through reward modeling, they introduce significant complexity, requiring the optimization of an auxiliary reward function followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and often unstable. To address these challenges, we propose direct document relevance optimization (DDRO), which aligns token-level docid generation with document-level relevance estimation through direct optimization via pairwise ranking, eliminating the need for explicit reward modeling and reinforcement learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO document and Natural Questions, show that DDRO outperforms reinforcement learning-based methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in MRR@10 for MS MARCO and a 19.9% improvement for Natural Questions.

However, it still faces challenges due to the misalignment of scale and spatial information between features extracted from 2D images and those derived from 3D point clouds. Existing methods usually aggregate multimodal features at a single stage. However, leveraging multi-stage cross-modal features is crucial for detecting objects of various scales. Therefore, these methods often struggle to integrate features across different scales and modalities effectively, thereby restricting the accuracy of detection. Additionally, the time-consuming Query-Key-Value-based (QKV-based) cross-attention operations often utilized in existing methods aid in reasoning the location and existence of objects by capturing non-local contexts. However, this approach tends to increase computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present SSLFusion, a novel Scale & Space Aligned Latent Fusion Model, consisting of a scale-aligned fusion strategy (SAF), a 3D-to-2D space alignment module (SAM), and a latent cross-modal fusion module (LFM). SAF mitigates scale misalignment between modalities by aggregating features from both images and point clouds across multiple levels. SAM is designed to reduce the inter-modal gap between features from images and point clouds by incorporating 3D coordinate information into 2D image features. Additionally, LFM captures cross-modal non-local contexts in the latent space without utilizing the QKV-based attention operations, thus mitigating computational complexity. Experiments on the KITTI and DENSE datasets demonstrate that our SSLFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Trackers can improve their generalization ability by leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, challenges arise with the fine-tuning strategies when VLMs are transferred to OWT: full fine-tuning results in excessive parameter and memory costs, while the zero-shot strategy leads to sub-optimal performance. To solve the problem, EffOWT is proposed for efficiently transferring VLMs to OWT. Specifically, we build a small and independent learnable side network outside the VLM backbone. By freezing the backbone and only executing backpropagation on the side network, the model's efficiency requirements can be met. In addition, EffOWT enhances the side network by proposing a hybrid structure of Transformer and CNN to improve the model's performance in the OWT field. Finally, we implement sparse interactions on the MLP, thus reducing parameter updates and memory costs significantly. Thanks to the proposed methods, EffOWT achieves an absolute gain of 5.5% on the tracking metric OWTA for unknown categories, while only updating 1.3% of the parameters compared to full fine-tuning, with a 36.4% memory saving. Other metrics also demonstrate obvious improvement."}

However, limited attention has been given to the interpretability of the clusters detected by most clustering algorithms. In addition, due to the homogeneity of data, different groups of data have their own homogeneous styles. In this paper, the above two aspects are considered, and an interpretable style Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy clustering (IS-TSK-FC) algorithm is proposed. The clustering behavior of IS-TSK-FC is fully guided by the TSK fuzzy inference on fuzzy rules. In particular, samples are grouped into clusters represented by the corresponding consequent vectors of all fuzzy rules learned in an unsupervised manner. This can explain how the clusters are generated in detail, thus making the underlying decision-making process of the IS-TSK-FC interpretable. Moreover, a series of style matrices are introduced to facilitate the consequents of fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC by capturing the styles of clusters as well as the nuances between different styles. Consequently, all the fuzzy rules in IS-TSK-FC have powerful data representation capability. After determining the antecedents of all the fuzzy rules, the optimization problem of IS-TSK-FC can be iteratively solved in an alternation manner. The effectiveness of IS-TSK-FC as an interpretable clustering tool is validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets with unknown implicit/explicit styles. Specially, the superior clustering performance of IS-TSK-FC is demonstrated on case studies where different groups of data present explicit styles.

As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems.

In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts.

However, existing approaches predominantly treat each user's historical interactions as independent training samples, overlooking the potential of higher-order collaborative signals between users and items. Such signals, which encapsulate richer and more nuanced relationships, can be naturally captured using graph-based data structures. To address this limitation, we extend diffusion-based recommendation methods to the graph domain by directly modeling user-item bipartite graphs with diffusion models. This enables better modeling of the higher-order connectivity inherent in complex interaction dynamics. However, this extension introduces two primary challenges: (1) Noise Heterogeneity, where interactions are influenced by various forms of continuous and discrete noise, and (2) Relation Explosion, referring to the high computational costs of processing large-scale graphs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Graph-based Diffusion Model for Collaborative Filtering (GDMCF). To address noise heterogeneity, we introduce a multi-level noise corruption mechanism that integrates both continuous and discrete noise, effectively simulating real-world interaction complexities. To mitigate relation explosion, we design a user-active guided diffusion process that selectively focuses on the most meaningful edges and active users, reducing inference costs while preserving the graph's topological integrity. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GDMCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing higher-order collaborative signals and improving recommendation performance."}

To overcome this, text augmentation techniques are commonly used to increases sample size by transforming the original input data into artificial ones with the label preserved. However, traditional text classification methods ignores the relationship between augmented texts and treats them as independent samples which may introduce classification error. Therefore, we propose a novel approach called 'Batch Aggregation' (BAGG) which explicitly models the dependence of text inputs generated through augmentation by incorporating an additional layer that aggregates results from correlated texts. Through studying multiple benchmark data sets across different domains, we found that BAGG can improve classification accuracy. We also found that the increase of performance with BAGG is more obvious in domain specific data sets, with accuracy improvements of up to 10-29%. Through the analysis of benchmark data, the proposed method addresses limitations of traditional techniques and improves robustness in text classification tasks. Our result demonstrates that BAGG offers more robust results and outperforms traditional approaches when training data is limited."}

It is therefore paramount that we can justify our choice of metrics in these assessments, especially for difficult to quantify ethical and social values. We present a two-step approach to ensure metrics are properly motivated. First, a conception needs to be spelled out (e.g. Rawlsian fairness or fairness as solidarity) and then a metric can be fitted to that conception. Both steps require separate justifications, as conceptions can be judged on how well they fit with the function of, for example, fairness. We argue that conceptual engineering offers helpful tools for this step. Second, metrics need to be fitted to a conception. We illustrate this process through an examination of competing fairness metrics to illustrate that here the additional content that a conception offers helps us justify the choice for a specific metric. We thus advocate that impact assessments are not only clear on their metrics, but also on the conceptions that motivate those metrics.'}

Nevertheless, in the most of the cases, the grasping and manipulation actions involve low to moderate payload and interaction forces. This is due to limitations often presented by the end-effectors, which can not match their arm-reachable payload, and hence limit the payload that can be grasped and manipulated. In addition, grippers usually do not embed adequate perception in their hardware, and grasping actions are mainly driven by perception sensors installed in the rest of the robot body, frequently affected by occlusions due to the arm motions during the execution of the grasping and manipulation tasks. To address the above, we developed a modular high grasping force gripper equipped with embedded multi-modal perception functionalities. The proposed gripper can generate a grasping force of 110 N in a compact implementation.

We introduce Collab-RAG, a collaborative training framework that leverages mutual enhancement between a white-box small language model (SLM) and a blackbox large language model (LLM) for RAG. Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average. In particular, our fine-tuned 3B SLM surpasses a frozen 32B LLM in question decomposition, highlighting the efficiency of Collab-RAG in improving reasoning and retrieval for complex questions.

Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency. To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experiments on advanced models including Sora demonstrate that Video-Bench achieves superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment."}

Existing TIC solutions either (i) fail to capture the rich text semantics due to the use of context-free text embeddings, and/or (ii) disregard the bipartite structure and node heterogeneity of TINs, leading to compromised TIC performance. In this work, we propose SAFT, a new architecture that integrates language- and graph-based modules for the effective fusion of textual and structural semantics in the representation learning of interactions. In particular, line graph attention (LGA)/gated attention units (GAUs) and pretrained language models (PLMs) are capitalized on to model the interaction-level and token-level signals, which are further coupled via the proxy token in an iterative and contextualized fashion. Additionally, an efficient and theoretically-grounded approach is developed to encode the local and global topology information pertaining to interactions into structural embeddings. The resulting embeddings not only inject the structural features underlying TINs into the textual interaction encoding but also facilitate the design of graph sampling strategies.

In this paper, we ask: How can we build a universal detection framework that is effective for most facial deepfakes? One significant challenge is the wide variety of deepfake generators available, resulting in varying forgery artifacts (e.g., lighting inconsistency, color mismatch, etc). But should we ``teach" the detector to learn all these artifacts separately? It is impossible and impractical to elaborate on them all. So the core idea is to pinpoint the more common and general artifacts across different deepfakes. Accordingly, we categorize deepfake artifacts into two distinct yet complementary types: Face Inconsistency Artifacts (FIA) and Up-Sampling Artifacts (USA). FIA arise from the challenge of generating all intricate details, inevitably causing inconsistencies between the complex facial features and relatively uniform surrounding areas. USA, on the other hand, are the inevitable traces left by the generator\'s decoder during the up-sampling process. This categorization stems from the observation that all existing deepfakes typically exhibit one or both of these artifacts. To achieve this, we propose a new data-level pseudo-fake creation framework that constructs fake samples with only the FIA and USA, without introducing extra less-general artifacts. Specifically, we employ a super-resolution to simulate the USA, while design a Blender module that uses image-level self-blending on diverse facial regions to create the FIA. We surprisingly found that, with this intuitive design, a standard image classifier trained only with our pseudo-fake data can non-trivially generalize well to unseen deepfakes.'}

Unfortunately, current benchmarks in data engineering only evaluate isolated tasks, such as using data tools and writing data transformation queries, leaving a significant gap in evaluating AI agents for generating end-to-end ELT pipelines.\nTo fill this gap, we introduce ELT-Bench, an end-to-end benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of AI agents to build ELT pipelines.

By simulating realistic scenarios involving the integration of diverse data sources and the use of popular data tools, ELT-Bench evaluates AI agents' abilities in handling complex data engineering workflows. AI agents must interact with databases and data tools, write code and SQL queries, and orchestrate every pipeline stage. We evaluate two representative code agent frameworks, Spider-Agent and SWE-Agent, using six popular Large Language Models (LLMs) on ELT-Bench. The highest-performing agent, Spider-Agent Claude-3.7-Sonnet with extended thinking, correctly generates only 3.9% of data models, with an average cost of $4.30 and 89.3 steps per pipeline.

We find that even with knowledge distillation from larger verifiers, sLMs struggle with verification tasks requiring memorization, such as numerical calculations and fact-checking. To address this limitation, we propose Tool-integrated self-verification (T1), which delegates memorization-heavy verification steps to external tools, such as a code interpreter. Our theoretical analysis shows that tool integration reduces memorization demands and improves test-time scaling performance. Experiments on the MATH benchmark demonstrate that, with T1, a Llama-3.2 1B model under test-time scaling outperforms the significantly larger Llama-3.1 8B model.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Adversarial Multi-Step Training Framework for Knowledge Tracing (AdvKT), which, for the first time, focuses on the multi-step KT task. More specifically, AdvKT leverages adversarial learning paradigm involving a generator and a discriminator. The generator mimics high-reward responses, effectively reducing error accumulation across multiple steps, while the discriminator provides feedback to generate synthetic data. Additionally, we design specialized data augmentation techniques to enrich the training data with realistic variations, ensuring that the model generalizes well even in scenarios with sparse data. Experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdvKT over existing KT models, showcasing its ability to address both error accumulation and data sparsity issues effectively."}

However, current methods focus on learning consistency in representation, neglecting the contribution of each view's complementarity aspect in representation learning. This limit poses a significant challenge in multi-view representation learning. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering framework that introduces a disentangled variational autoencoder that separates multi-view into shared and private information, i.e., consistency and complementarity information. We first learn informative and consistent representations by maximizing mutual information across different views through contrastive learning. This process will ignore complementary information. Then, we employ consistency inference constraints to explicitly utilize complementary information when attempting to seek the consistency of shared information across all views. Specifically, we perform a within-reconstruction using the private and shared information of each view and a cross-reconstruction using the shared information of all views. The dual consistency constraints are not only effective in improving the representation quality of data but also easy to extend to other scenarios, especially in complex multi-view scenes. This could be the first attempt to employ dual consistent constraint in a unified MVC theoretical framework. During the training procedure, the consistency and complementarity features are jointly optimized. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms baseline methods."}

This paper proposes the Text-Conditioned Knowledge Recycling (TCKR) pipeline to tackle these challenges. TCKR combines dynamic image captioning, parameter-efficient diffusion model fine-tuning, and Generative Knowledge Distillation techniques to create synthetic datasets tailored for image classification. The pipeline is rigorously evaluated on ten diverse image classification benchmarks. The results demonstrate that models trained solely on TCKR-generated data achieve classification accuracies on par with (and in several cases exceeding) models trained on real images. Furthermore, the evaluation reveals that these synthetic-data-trained models exhibit substantially enhanced privacy characteristics: their vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks is significantly reduced, with the membership inference AUC lowered by 5.49 points on average compared to using real training data, demonstrating a substantial improvement in the performance-privacy trade-off.

Inspired by the interpretability theory of feature attribution in neural network models, we observe that not all tokens have the same contribution. Based on this observation, we propose a novel token pruning framework, namely Saliency-driven Dynamic Token Pruning (SDTP), to gradually and dynamically prune redundant tokens based on the input context. Specifically, a lightweight saliency-driven prediction module is designed to estimate the importance score of each token with its hidden state, which is added to different layers of the LLM to hierarchically prune redundant tokens. Furthermore, a ranking-based optimization strategy is proposed to minimize the ranking divergence of the saliency score and the predicted importance score. Extensive experiments have shown that our framework is generalizable to various models and datasets. By hierarchically pruning 65\\% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 33\\% $\\sim$ 47\\% FLOPs and achieves speedup up to 1.75$\\times$ during inference, while maintaining comparable performance.

The basic framework involves an item tokenizer, which represents each item as a sequence of codes serving as its identifier, and a generative recommender that predicts the next item by autoregressively generating the target item identifier. However, in existing methods, both the tokenizer and the recommender are typically domain-specific, limiting their ability for effective transfer or adaptation to new domains. To this end, we propose UTGRec, a Universal item Tokenization approach for transferable Generative Recommendation. Specifically, we design a universal item tokenizer for encoding rich item semantics by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM). By devising tree-structured codebooks, we discretize content representations into corresponding codes for item tokenization. To effectively learn the universal item tokenizer on multiple domains, we introduce two key techniques in our approach. For raw content reconstruction, we employ dual lightweight decoders to reconstruct item text and images from discrete representations to capture general knowledge embedded in the content. For collaborative knowledge integration, we assume that co-occurring items are similar and integrate collaborative signals through co-occurrence alignment and reconstruction. Finally, we present a joint learning framework to pre-train and adapt the transferable generative recommender across multiple domains. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of UTGRec compared to both traditional and generative recommendation baselines.'}

Existing methods typically adopt a one-to-one mapping strategy, where each item is represented by a single identifier.

To overcome these limitations, we propose MTGRec, which leverages Multi-identifier item Tokenization to augment token sequence data for Generative Recommender pre-training. Our approach involves two key innovations: multi-identifier item tokenization and curriculum recommender pre-training. For multi-identifier item tokenization, we leverage the RQ-VAE as the tokenizer backbone and treat model checkpoints from adjacent training epochs as semantically relevant tokenizers. This allows each item to be associated with multiple identifiers, enabling a single user interaction sequence to be converted into several token sequences as different data groups. For curriculum recommender pre-training, we introduce a curriculum learning scheme guided by data influence estimation, dynamically adjusting the sampling probability of each data group during recommender pre-training. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model using a single tokenizer to ensure accurate item identification for recommendation.

A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 575000 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 81% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics."}

However, the quality of the generated code is heavily dependent on the structure and composition of the prompts used. Crafting high-quality prompts is a challenging task that requires significant knowledge and skills of prompt engineering. To advance the automation support for the prompt engineering for LLM-based code generation, we propose a novel solution Diffusion-Driven Prompt Tuning (DDPT) that learns how to generate optimal prompt embedding from Gaussian Noise to automate the prompt engineering for code generation. We evaluate the feasibility of diffusion-based optimization and abstract the optimal prompt embedding as a directional vector toward the optimal embedding. We use the code generation loss given by the LLMs to help the diffusion model capture the distribution of optimal prompt embedding during training. The trained diffusion model can build a path from the noise distribution to the optimal distribution at the sampling phrase, the evaluation result demonstrates that DDPT helps improve the prompt optimization for code generation.'}

Finally, the performance of these models was evaluated using the F1 score, 95\\% confidence interval (CI) and paired-sample t-tests on our constructed dataset, with the prediction results further assessed by radiologists. Using zero-shot prompting, the fine-tuned Llama-3-70B-Instruct model achieved the best performance with the following F1 scores: 0.769 for negation errors, 0.772 for left/right errors, 0.750 for interval change errors, 0.828 for transcription errors, and 0.780 overall. In the real-world evaluation phase, two radiologists reviewed 200 randomly selected reports output by the model.

Previous studies revealed that attention exhibits irregular patterns when hallucination occurs. Inspired by this, we extract features from the attention matrix that provide complementary views of (a) the average attention each token receives, which helps identify whether certain tokens are overly influential or ignored, (b) the diversity of attention each token receives, which reveals whether attention is biased toward specific subsets, and (c) the diversity of tokens a token attends to during generation, which indicates whether the model references a narrow or broad range of information. These features are input to a Transformer-based classifier to conduct token-level classification to identify hallucinated spans. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on hallucination detection with longer input contexts, i.e., data-to-text and summarization tasks.'}

Traditional evaluation metrics often overlook this trade-off. Inspired by linguistic principles of communicative efficiency, this paper investigates the optimal number of clusters by quantifying the trade-off between informativeness and cognitive simplicity. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate cluster names and evaluate their effectiveness through semantic density, information theory, and clustering accuracy. Our results show that Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering on embeddings generated by a LLM, increases semantic density compared to random assignment, effectively grouping similar bios. However, as clusters increase, interpretability declines, as measured by a generative LLM\'s ability to correctly assign bios based on cluster names. A logistic regression analysis confirms that classification accuracy depends on the semantic similarity between bios and their assigned cluster names, as well as their distinction from alternatives.\nThese findings reveal a "Goldilocks zone" where clusters remain distinct yet interpretable. We identify an optimal range of 16-22 clusters, paralleling linguistic efficiency in lexical categorization. These insights inform both theoretical models and practical applications, guiding future research toward optimising cluster interpretability and usefulness.'}

We show that there are multiclass classification problems where predictive models holistically outperform LLM prompt-based frameworks. Given text and images from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers, we build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category (e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description. We then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve the same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM prompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In particular, the embeddings approach has 49.5% higher accuracy than the prompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only, image-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields well-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to provide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary, prompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is 14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text respectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10 times cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the embeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent with our offline analysis. Our study shows that for multiclass classification problems that can leverage proprietary datasets, an embeddings-based approach may yield unequivocally better results. Hence, scientists, practitioners, engineers, and business leaders can use our study to go beyond the hype and consider appropriate predictive models for their classification use cases.'}

For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of Navier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate high-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and vortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on accurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been well known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward learning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in general. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE benchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant frequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the spectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of high-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these issues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad range of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements: (i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a high-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel frequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This introduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of trainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO that relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE problems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the qualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our method over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines."}

Given the challenges of recognizing subtle expressions with considerable interpersonal variability, state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods focus on the multi-source UDA (MSDA) setting, where each domain corresponds to a specific subject, and improve model accuracy and robustness. However, when adapting to a specific target, the diverse nature of multiple source domains translates to a large shift between source and target data. State-of-the-art MSDA methods for FER address this domain shift by considering all the sources to adapt to the target representations. Nevertheless, adapting to a target subject presents significant challenges due to large distributional differences between source and target domains, often resulting in negative transfer. In addition, integrating all sources simultaneously increases computational costs and causes misalignment with the target. To address these issues, we propose a progressive MSDA approach that gradually introduces information from subjects based on their similarity to the target subject. This will ensure that only the most relevant sources from the target are selected, which helps avoid the negative transfer caused by dissimilar sources. We first exploit the closest sources to reduce the distribution shift with the target and then move towards the furthest while only considering the most relevant sources based on the predetermined threshold. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by the incremental introduction of source subjects, we implemented a density-based memory mechanism that preserves the most relevant historical source samples for adaptation.

The automation, which includes a pre-trained classifier, observes data for a batch of independent tasks, analyzes them, and may refer a subset of tasks to a human operator for fresh and final analysis. Our key modeling assumption is that human performance degrades with task load. We model the problem of choosing which tasks to refer as a stochastic optimization problem and show that, for a given task load, it is optimal to myopically refer tasks that yield the largest reduction in expected cost, conditional on the observed data. This provides a ranking scheme and a policy to determine the optimal set of tasks for referral. We evaluate this policy against a baseline through an experimental study with human participants. Using a radar screen simulator, participants made binary target classification decisions under time constraint. They were guided by a decision rule provided to them, but were still prone to errors under time pressure. An initial experiment estimated human performance model parameters, while a second experiment compared two referral policies. Results show statistically significant gains for the proposed optimal referral policy over a blind policy that determines referrals using the automation and human-performance models but not based on the observed data.'}

Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative advances in this area through real-time data integration and automated production planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has often fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To fully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from automation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can dynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are often slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly, particularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. This paper proposes a Bayesian multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM) framework that can intelligently select experiments as manufacturing progresses, guiding us toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more efficiently. The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian Optimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the underlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate, allowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous real-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and cost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The proposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other multi-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we evaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation metrics. BMSDM comprehensively outperforms the competing methods in multi-objective decision-making scenarios.

Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract latent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of uncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future observations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex natural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model quantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the development of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the most informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic opinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently outperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream predictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in natural language settings.'}

However, its reliance on simple retrieval limits its effectiveness. To address this limitation, recent studies have introduced the Multiple Needles In A Haystack Reasoning (MNIAH-R) task, which incorporates supporting documents (Multiple needles) of multi-hop reasoning tasks into a distracting context (Haystack}). Despite this advancement, existing approaches still fail to address the issue of models providing direct answers from internal knowledge, and they do not explain or mitigate the decline in accuracy as context length increases. In this paper, we tackle the memory-based answering problem by filtering out direct-answer questions, and we reveal that performance degradation is primarily driven by the reduction in the length of the thinking process as the input length increases. Building on this insight, we decompose the thinking process into retrieval and reasoning stages and introduce a reflection mechanism for multi-round extension. We also train a model using the generated iterative thinking process, which helps mitigate the performance degradation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of this retrieval-reflection capability in mathematical reasoning scenarios, improving GPT-4o's performance on AIME2024."}

Deficient macronutrient content results in stunted growth, delayed maturation, and increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, thereby accentuating the imperative for precise soil nutrient monitoring. Traditional techniques such as chemical assays, atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods, albeit advanced, are prohibitively expensive and time-intensive, thus unsuitable for real-time macronutrient assessment. In this study, we propose an innovative soil testing protocol utilizing a dataset derived from synthetic solutions to model soil behaviour. The dataset encompasses physical properties including conductivity and pH, with a concentration on three key macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Four machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, with random forest regressors and neural networks being selected for the prediction of soil nutrient concentrations. Comparative analysis with laboratory soil testing results revealed prediction errors of 23.6% for phosphorus and 16% for potassium using the random forest model, and 26.3% for phosphorus and 21.8% for potassium using the neural network model.

The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors, including the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of visual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data. Extensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance, OPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on "anchor tokens", thereby reducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a contrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of hallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time Accumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically accumulates and updates LVLMs\' attention on image tokens during generation. By enhancing the model\'s attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations caused by the decay of attention on image tokens.

This paper introduces DocSAM, a transformer-based unified framework designed for various document image segmentation tasks, such as document layout analysis, multi-granularity text segmentation, and table structure recognition, by modelling these tasks as a combination of instance and semantic segmentation. Specifically, DocSAM employs Sentence-BERT to map category names from each dataset into semantic queries that match the dimensionality of instance queries. These two sets of queries interact through an attention mechanism and are cross-attended with image features to predict instance and semantic segmentation masks. Instance categories are predicted by computing the dot product between instance and semantic queries, followed by softmax normalization of scores. Consequently, DocSAM can be jointly trained on heterogeneous datasets, enhancing robustness and generalization while reducing computational and storage resources.

We establish upper and lower bounds on the joint excess risk for this algorithm. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between memory complexity and statistical efficiency, where memory complexity is measured by the number of vectors needed to define the structural regularization. Specifically, increasing the number of vectors in structural regularization leads to a worse memory complexity but an improved excess risk, and vice versa. Furthermore, our theory suggests that naive continual learning without regularization suffers from catastrophic forgetting, while structural regularization mitigates this issue. Notably, structural regularization achieves comparable performance to joint training with access to both tasks simultaneously. These results highlight the critical role of curvature-aware regularization for continual learning.'}

Current approaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or decomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of coarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering the above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while alleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed that the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us to build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions tightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in current models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text representation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve fitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text centers, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying on the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the location features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions by using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to reconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of EdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is designed.

Notably, the efficacy of LLMs remains significantly dependent on the quality and structure of the input prompts, making prompt design a critical factor for their performance.

However, these methods often suffer from the lack of standardization and compatibility across different techniques, limited flexibility in customization, inconsistent performance across model scales, and they often exclusively rely on expensive proprietary LLM APIs. To fill in this gap, we introduce GREATERPROMPT, a novel framework that democratizes prompt optimization by unifying diverse methods under a unified, customizable API while delivering highly effective prompts for different tasks. Our framework flexibly accommodates various model scales by leveraging both text feedback-based optimization for larger LLMs and internal gradient-based optimization for smaller models to achieve powerful and precise prompt improvements.

Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos, our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and enhancing model capabilities in achieving fine-grained, temporally coherent video-text alignment."}

By employing prompt engineering to structure retrieved content within the LLM's context window, DCCI ensures accuracy, relevance, and contextual alignment, mitigating hallucination. To evaluate DCCI's effectiveness, Ask ME's usability, and broader student perceptions of AI in education, a mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating user satisfaction ratings and a structured survey. Results from a pilot study indicate high user satisfaction (4.614/5), with students recognizing Ask ME's ability to provide timely and contextually relevant responses for both administrative and course-related inquiries. Additionally, a majority of students agreed that Ask ME's integration with course content in Canvas LMS reduced platform-switching, improving usability, engagement, and comprehension. AI's role in reducing classroom hesitation and fostering self-directed learning and intellectual curiosity was also highlighted. Despite these benefits and positive perception of AI tools, concerns emerged regarding over-reliance on AI, accuracy limitations, and ethical issues such as plagiarism and reduced student-teacher interaction.

This paper presents DeepOHeat-v1, an enhanced physics-informed operator learning framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with learnable activation functions as trunk networks, enabling an adaptive representation of multi-scale thermal patterns. This approach achieves a $1.25\\times$ and $6.29\\times$ reduction in error in two representative test cases. Second, we introduce a separable training method that decomposes the basis function along the coordinate axes, achieving $62\\times$ training speedup and $31\\times$ GPU memory reduction in our baseline case, and enabling thermal analysis at resolutions previously infeasible due to GPU memory constraints. Third, we propose a confidence score to evaluate the trustworthiness of the predicted results, and further develop a hybrid optimization workflow that combines operator learning with finite difference (FD) using Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method for incremental solution refinement, enabling efficient and trustworthy thermal optimization.

TGraphX overcomes these limitations by employing CNNs to generate multi-dimensional node features (e.g., (3*128*128) tensors) that preserve local spatial semantics. These spatially aware nodes participate in a graph where message passing is performed using 1*1 convolutions, which fuse adjacent features while maintaining their structure. Furthermore, a deep CNN aggregator with residual connections is used to robustly refine the fused messages, ensuring stable gradient flow and end-to-end trainability.

While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.'}

This creates a feedback loop as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this generated, synthetic data. This phenomenon is receiving increasing interest, in particular because previous studies have shown that it may lead to distribution shift - models misrepresent and forget the true underlying distributions of human data they are expected to approximate (e.g. resulting in a drastic loss of quality). In this study, we study the impact of human data properties on distribution shift dynamics in iterated training loops. We first confirm that the distribution shift dynamics greatly vary depending on the human data by comparing four datasets (two based on Twitter and two on Reddit). We then test whether data quality may influence the rate of this shift. We find that it does on the twitter, but not on the Reddit datasets. We then focus on a Reddit dataset and conduct a more exhaustive evaluation of a large set of dataset properties. This experiment associated lexical diversity with larger, and semantic diversity with smaller detrimental shifts, suggesting that incorporating text with high lexical (but limited semantic) diversity could exacerbate the degradation of generated text. We then focus on the evolution of political bias, and find that the type of shift observed (bias reduction, amplification or inversion) depends on the political lean of the human (true) distribution. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on the consequences of recursive fine-tuning by showing that this phenomenon is highly dependent on features of the human data on which training occurs. This suggests that different parts of internet (e.g. GitHub, Reddit) may undergo different types of shift depending on their properties.'}

In this work, we investigate redundancy within Transformer-based models and propose an entropy-based pruning strategy to enhance efficiency while maintaining performance. Empirical analysis reveals that the entropy of hidden representations decreases in the early blocks but progressively increases across most subsequent blocks. This trend suggests that entropy serves as a more effective measure of information richness within computation blocks. Unlike cosine similarity, which primarily captures geometric relationships, entropy directly quantifies uncertainty and information content, making it a more reliable criterion for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our entropy-based pruning approach surpasses cosine similarity-based methods in reducing model size while preserving accuracy, offering a promising direction for efficient model deployment.'}

Existing FAL methods typically rely on iterative annotation processes that separate active sampling from federated updates, leading to multiple rounds of expensive communication and annotation. In response, we introduce FAST, a two-pass FAL framework that harnesses foundation models for weak labeling in a preliminary pass, followed by a refinement pass focused exclusively on the most uncertain samples. By leveraging representation knowledge from foundation models and integrating refinement steps into a streamlined workflow, FAST substantially reduces the overhead incurred by iterative active sampling.

Recently, combining domain transform with SHAP has improved interpretability by extending explanations to more informative domains. Nonetheless, the computational expense of SHAP, exacerbated by increased dimensions from domain transforms, remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose patch-wise attribution and SHapley Estimated Explanation (SHEP).

While multiorder inferences offer robust predictive capabilities, they often come with significant computational overhead. The Sequence Memory (SM) component of HTM, which manages these inferences, encounters bottlenecks primarily due to its extensive programmable interconnects.

By using both analytical and empirical estimates of explanation variance, we provide a systematic means of assessing the impact uncertainty on explanations. We illustrate the approach using a first-order uncertainty propagation as the analytical estimator. In a comprehensive evaluation across heterogeneous datasets, we compare analytical and empirical estimates of uncertainty propagation and evaluate their robustness.

However, these alignment stages focus primarily on the assistant role, leaving the user role unaligned, and stick to a fixed input prompt structure of special tokens, leaving the model vulnerable when inputs deviate from these expectations. We introduce Role-Modality Attacks (RMA), a novel class of adversarial attacks that exploit role confusion between the user and assistant and alter the position of the image token to elicit harmful outputs. Unlike existing attacks that modify query content, RMAs manipulate the input structure without altering the query itself. We systematically evaluate these attacks across multiple Vision Language Models (VLMs) on eight distinct settings, showing that they can be composed to create stronger adversarial prompts, as also evidenced by their increased projection in the negative refusal direction in the residual stream, a property observed in prior successful attacks. Finally, for mitigation, we propose an adversarial training approach that makes the model robust against input prompt perturbations. By training the model on a range of harmful and benign prompts all perturbed with different RMA settings, it loses its sensitivity to Role Confusion and Modality Manipulation attacks and is trained to only pay attention to the content of the query in the input prompt structure, effectively reducing Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the model's general utility."}

Over the last few decades, high throughput experimental approaches have been used to identify and understand epigenetic changes, but these laboratory experimental approaches and biochemical processes are time-consuming and expensive.

Using a controlled experimental design, we simulate interactions between AI Assistants (both benign and deliberately malicious) and users across eight decision-making scenarios of varying complexity and stakes. Our methodology employs two state-of-the-art language models to generate interaction data and implements Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP) to detect malicious AI Assistants. The findings reveal that malicious AI Assistants employ domain-specific persona-tailored manipulation strategies, exploiting simulated users' vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. In particular, simulated users demonstrate resistance to manipulation initially, but become increasingly vulnerable to malicious AI Assistants as the depth of the interaction increases, highlighting the significant risks associated with extended engagement with potentially manipulative systems.

To address this issue, we propose TaskEdge, a task-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework at the edge, which allocates the most effective parameters to the target task and only updates the task-specific parameters.

In doing so, TaskEdge can significantly reduce the computational cost and memory usage while maintaining performance on the target downstream tasks by updating less than 0.1\\% of the parameters.

To address this, we reframe fairness evaluation using Borda scores, a method from voting theory, as a nuanced yet interpretable metric for measuring fairness. Using organ allocation as a case study, we introduce two tasks: (1) Choose-One and (2) Rank-All. In Choose-One, LLMs select a single candidate for a kidney, and we assess fairness across demographics using proportional parity. In Rank-All, LLMs rank all candidates for a kidney, reflecting real-world allocation processes.

A critical factor for their safe and efficient operation is the distribution of concentrated solar flux on the receiver. However, flux distributions from individual heliostats are sensitive to surface imperfections. Measuring these surfaces across many heliostats remains impractical in real-world deployments. As a result, control systems often assume idealized heliostat surfaces, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety risks. To address this, inverse Deep Learning Raytracing (iDLR) has been introduced as a novel method for inferring heliostat surface profiles from target images recorded during standard calibration procedures. In this work, we present the first successful Sim-to-Real transfer of iDLR, enabling accurate surface predictions directly from real-world target images. We evaluate our method on 63 heliostats under real operational conditions. iDLR surface predictions achieve a median mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 mm and show good agreement with deflectometry ground truth in 84% of cases. When used in raytracing simulations, it enables flux density predictions with a mean accuracy of 90% compared to deflectometry over our dataset, and outperforms the commonly used ideal heliostat surface assumption by 26%. We tested this approach in a challenging double-extrapolation scenario-involving unseen sun positions and receiver projection-and found that iDLR maintains high predictive accuracy, highlighting its generalization capabilities.

Given the mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these tasks, it is essential to design edge inference systems that are both reliable and capable of meeting stringent end-to-end (E2E) latency constraints. Existing studies, which primarily focus on communication reliability as characterized by channel outage probability, may fail to guarantee E2E performance, specifically in terms of E2E inference accuracy and latency. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that introduces and mathematically characterizes the inference outage (InfOut) probability, which quantifies the likelihood that the E2E inference accuracy falls below a target threshold. Under an E2E latency constraint, this framework establishes a fundamental tradeoff between communication overhead (i.e., uploading more sensor observations) and inference reliability as quantified by the InfOut probability. To find a tractable way to optimize this tradeoff, we derive accurate surrogate functions for InfOut probability by applying a Gaussian approximation to the distribution of the received discriminant gain.

To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a self-learning-based method (SLPR) for optimizing free-form pipe routing in aeroengines. The SLPR is based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and integrates a unified rule modeling framework for efficient obstacle detection and fuzzy rule modeling in continuous space. Additionally, a potential energy table is constructed to enable rapid queries of layout tendencies and interference. The agent within SLPR iteratively refines pipe routing and accumulates the design knowledge through interaction with the environment. Once the design environment shifts, the agent can swiftly adapt by fine-tuning network parameters. Comparative tests reveal that SLPR ensures smooth pipe routing through cubic non-uniform B-spline (NURBS) curves, avoiding redundant pipe segments found in constant-curvature pipe routing. Results in both static and dynamic design environments demonstrate that SLPR outperforms three representative baselines in terms of the pipe length reduction, the adherence to layout rules, the path complexity, and the computational efficiency. Furthermore, tests in dynamic environments indicate that SLPR eliminates labor-intensive searches from scratch and even yields superior solutions compared to the retrained model. These results highlight the practical value of SLPR for real-world pipe routing, meeting lightweight, precision, and sustainability requirements of the modern aeroengine design.'}

We analyze DeepSeek's code generation capabilities for traditional HPC languages like Cpp, Fortran, Julia and Python. The evaluation includes testing for code correctness, performance, and scaling across different configurations and matrix sizes. We also provide a detailed comparison between DeepSeek and another widely used tool: GPT-4.

Given the burstiness and latency sensitivity of online tasks, over-provisioning resources is common practice. This allows for the integration of latency-insensitive offline tasks during periods of low online load, enhancing resource utilization. However, strategically serving online and offline tasks through a preemption mechanism fails to fully leverage the flexibility of offline tasks and suffers from KV cache recomputation and irregular workloads.\nIn this paper, we introduce Echo, a collaborative online-offline task serving system, including a scheduler, a KV cache manager, and estimation toolkits. The scheduler and KV cache manager work tightly to maximize the throughput of offline tasks, while the estimator further predicts execution time to ensure online task SLOs. The scheduler leverages the batch information of last iteration to reduce the search space for finding the optimal schedule. The KV cache manager sets the priority of the KV cache based on the type of tasks and the opportunity of prefix sharing to reduce the recomputation. Finally, the estimation toolkits predict the execution time, future memory consumption, and the throughput of offline tasks to guide the scheduler, KV cache manager, and the system deployer. Evaluation based on real-world workloads demonstrates that Echo can increase offline task throughput by up to $3.3\\times$, while satisfying online task SLOs.'}

Inspired by inter-subject correlation (ISC) utilized in neuroscience, this study introduces a novel Electroencephalography (EEG) based ISC methodology that leverages a single-electrode and feature-based dynamic approach. Our contributions are three folds. Firstly, we reidentify two potent emotion features suitable for classifying emotions-first-order difference (FD) an differential entropy (DE). Secondly, through the use of overall correlation analysis, we demonstrate the heterogeneous synchronized performance of electrodes. This performance aligns with neural emotion patterns established in prior studies, thus validating the effectiveness of our approach. Thirdly, by employing a sliding window correlation technique, we showcase the significant consistency of dynamic ISCs across various features or key electrodes in each analyzed film clip. Our findings indicate the method's reliability in capturing consistent, dynamic shared neural synchrony among individuals, triggered by evocative film stimuli. This underscores the potential of our approach to serve as an indicator of continuous human emotion arousal.

Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic classification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by their reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to generalize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including payload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets, leading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.'}
