Large language models (LLMs) that possess human-like ability in linguistic tasks are increasingly popular in assisting human graders to reduce their workload. However, LLMs' limitations in domain knowledge restrict their understanding in task-specific requirements and hinder their ability to achieve satisfactory performance. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution by enabling LLMs to access relevant domain-specific knowledge during assessment. In this work, we propose an adaptive RAG framework for automated grading that dynamically retrieves and incorporates domain-specific knowledge based on the question and student answer context. Our approach combines semantic search and curated educational sources to retrieve valuable reference materials. Experimental results in a science education dataset demonstrate that our system achieves an improvement in grading accuracy compared to baseline LLM approaches. The findings suggest that RAG-enhanced grading systems can serve as reliable support with efficient performance gains."}

Specifically, the SLM decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, thus enhancing the accuracy of the retrieval and facilitating more effective reasoning by the black-box LLM. Concurrently, the black-box LLM provides feedback signals to improve the SLM's decomposition capability. We observe that Collab-RAG relies solely on supervision from an affordable black-box LLM without additional distillation from frontier LLMs, yet demonstrates strong generalization across multiple black-box LLMs. Experimental evaluations across five multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Collab-RAG substantially outperforms existing black-box-only and SLM fine-tuning baselines by 1.8%-14.2% on average.

Yet, using RAG brings intrinsic challenges, as LLMs must deal with potentially conflicting knowledge, especially in multilingual retrieval, where the heterogeneity of knowledge retrieved may deliver different outlooks. To make RAG more analytical, critical and grounded, we introduce Dialectic-RAG (DRAG), a modular approach guided by Argumentative Explanations, i.e., structured reasoning process that systematically evaluates retrieved\ninformation by comparing, contrasting, and resolving conflicting perspectives. Given a query and a set of multilingual related documents, DRAG selects and exemplifies relevant knowledge for delivering dialectic explanations that, by critically weighing opposing arguments and filtering extraneous content, clearly determine the final response. Through a series of in-depth experiments, we show the impact of our framework both as an in-context learning strategy and for constructing demonstrations to instruct smaller models. The final results demonstrate that DRAG significantly improves RAG approaches, requiring low-impact computational effort and providing robustness to knowledge perturbations.'}

While fine-tuning improves fluency and enables stylistic customization, its ability to integrate unseen knowledge is constrained -- particularly with smaller datasets. Conversely, RAG-augmented models, equipped to incorporate external documents at inference, demonstrated superior factual accuracy on out-of-distribution prompts, though they lacked the stylistic consistency achieved by fine-tuning.

CharBoundary models offer balanced and adjustable precision-recall tradeoffs, with the large model achieving the highest F1 score (0.782) among all tested methods.\nNotably, NUPunkt provides a 29-32% precision improvement over general-purpose tools while maintaining exceptional throughput, processing multi-million document collections in minutes rather than hours. Both libraries run efficiently on standard CPU hardware without requiring specialized accelerators. NUPunkt is implemented in pure Python with zero external dependencies, while CharBoundary relies only on scikit-learn and optional ONNX runtime integration for optimized performance. Both libraries are available under the MIT license, can be installed via PyPI, and can be interactively tested at this https URL.\nThese libraries address critical precision issues in retrieval-augmented generation systems by preserving coherent legal concepts across sentences, where each percentage improvement in precision yields exponentially greater reductions in context fragmentation, creating cascading benefits throughout retrieval pipelines and significantly enhancing downstream reasoning quality.'}

A fundamental requirement for these models is accurate identification of TCM drug ingredients. In this paper, we evaluate how general and TCM-specialized LLMs perform when identifying ingredients of Chinese drugs. Our systematic analysis reveals consistent failure patterns: models often interpret drug names literally, overuse common herbs regardless of relevance, and exhibit erratic behaviors when faced with unfamiliar formulations. LLMs also fail to understand the verification task. These findings demonstrate that current LLMs rely primarily on drug names rather than possessing systematic pharmacological knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach focused on ingredient names. Experiments across 220 TCM formulations show our method significantly improves accuracy from approximately 50% to 82% in ingredient verification tasks.

While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.'}

By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model.

To this end, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that enhances LLMs-based planners with Knowledge Graph-based RAG for hierarchical plan generation. This method decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks, further expanded into executable atomic action sequences. To ensure formal correctness and proper decomposition, we integrate a Symbolic Validator, which also functions as a failure detector by aligning expected and observed world states. Our evaluation against baseline methods demonstrates the consistent significant advantages of integrating hierarchical planning, symbolic verification, and RAG across tasks of varying complexity and different LLMs. Additionally, our experimental setup and novel metrics not only validate our approach for complex planning but also serve as a tool for assessing LLMs' reasoning and compositional capabilities."}

To reduce this cost and leverage the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in relevance judgments, we aim to explore whether LLM-generated annotations can effectively replace human annotations in training retrieval models. Retrieval usually emphasizes relevance, which indicates "topic-relatedness" of a document to a query, while in RAG, the value of a document (or utility) depends on how it contributes to answer generation. Recognizing this mismatch, some researchers use LLM performance on downstream tasks with documents as labels, but this approach requires manual answers for specific tasks, leading to high costs and limited generalization. In another line of work, prompting LLMs to select useful documents as RAG references eliminates the need for human annotation and is not task-specific. If we leverage LLMs\' utility judgments to annotate retrieval data, we may retain cross-task generalization without human annotation in large-scale corpora. Therefore, we investigate utility-focused annotation via LLMs for large-scale retriever training data across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings on the retrieval and RAG tasks. To reduce the impact of low-quality positives labeled by LLMs, we design a novel loss function, i.e., Disj-InfoNCE. Our experiments reveal that: (1) Retrievers trained on utility-focused annotations significantly outperform those trained on human annotations in the out-of-domain setting on both tasks, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities. (2) LLM annotation does not replace human annotation in the in-domain setting. However, incorporating just 20% human-annotated data enables retrievers trained with utility-focused annotations to match the performance of models trained entirely with human annotations.'}

Motivated by these advancements, the remote sensing community has begun to adopt VLMs for remote sensing vision-language tasks, including scene understanding, image captioning, and visual question answering. However, existing remote sensing VLMs typically rely on closed-set scene understanding and focus on generic scene descriptions, yet lack the ability to incorporate external knowledge. This limitation hinders their capacity for semantic reasoning over complex or context-dependent queries that involve domain-specific or world knowledge. To address these challenges, we first introduced a multimodal Remote Sensing World Knowledge (RSWK) dataset, which comprises high-resolution satellite imagery and detailed textual descriptions for 14,141 well-known landmarks from 175 countries, integrating both remote sensing domain knowledge and broader world knowledge. Building upon this dataset, we proposed a novel Remote Sensing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RS-RAG) framework, which consists of two key components. The Multi-Modal Knowledge Vector Database Construction module encodes remote sensing imagery and associated textual knowledge into a unified vector space. The Knowledge Retrieval and Response Generation module retrieves and re-ranks relevant knowledge based on image and/or text queries, and incorporates the retrieved content into a knowledge-augmented prompt to guide the VLM in producing contextually grounded responses. We validated the effectiveness of our approach on three representative vision-language tasks, including image captioning, image classification, and visual question answering, where RS-RAG significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines.'}

The impact of these errors on current RAG methods against such errors remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose QE-RAG, the first robust RAG benchmark designed specifically to evaluate performance against query entry errors. We augment six widely used datasets by injecting three common types of query entry errors into randomly selected user queries at rates of 20\\% and 40\\%, simulating typical user behavior in real-world scenarios. We analyze the impact of these errors on LLM outputs and find that corrupted queries degrade model performance, which can be mitigated through query correction and training a robust retriever for retrieving relevant documents. Based on these insights, we propose a contrastive learning-based robust retriever training method and a retrieval-augmented query correction method. Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments reveal that: (1) state-of-the-art RAG methods including sequential, branching, and iterative methods, exhibit poor robustness to query entry errors; (2) our method significantly enhances the robustness of RAG when handling query entry errors and it's compatible with existing RAG methods, further improving their robustness."}
