In this paper, we develop DoCIA, an online framework that enhances ST performance by incorporating document-level context. DoCIA decomposes the ST pipeline into four stages. Document-level context is integrated into the ASR refinement, MT, and MT refinement stages through auxiliary LLM (large language model)-based modules. Furthermore, DoCIA leverages document-level information in a multi-level manner while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a simple yet effective determination mechanism is introduced to prevent hallucinations from excessive refinement, ensuring the reliability of the final results. Experimental results show that DoCIA significantly outperforms traditional ST baselines in both sentence and discourse metrics across four LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving ST performance.'}

While general LLMs have demonstrated strong generalization across a variety of tasks, they often struggle to perform well in specialized domains such as finance, healthcare, and code generation for underrepresented languages. Additionally, their static nature limits their ability to evolve with the changing world, and they are often extremely large in size, making them impractical and costly to deploy at scale. As a result, the adaptation of LLMs has drawn much attention since the birth of LLMs and is of core importance, both for industry, which focuses on serving its targeted users, and academia, which can greatly benefit from small but powerful LLMs. To address this gap, this tutorial aims to provide an overview of the LLM adaptation techniques. We start with an introduction to LLM adaptation, from both the data perspective and the model perspective. We then emphasize how the evaluation metrics and benchmarks are different from other techniques. After establishing the problems, we explore various adaptation techniques. We categorize adaptation techniques into two main families. The first is parametric knowledge adaptation, which focuses on updating the parametric knowledge within LLMs. Additionally, we will discuss real-time adaptation techniques, including model editing, which allows LLMs to be updated dynamically in production environments. The second kind of adaptation is semi-parametric knowledge adaptation, where the goal is to update LLM parameters to better leverage external knowledge or tools through techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based systems.'}

However, traditional approaches like RLHF or RLAIF treat the problem as single-step. As focus shifts toward more complex reasoning and agentic tasks, language models must take multiple steps of text generation, reasoning and environment interaction before generating a solution. We propose a synthetic data generation and RL methodology targeting multi-step optimization scenarios. This approach, called Step-Wise Reinforcement Learning (SWiRL), iteratively generates multi-step reasoning and tool use data, and then learns from that data. It employs a simple step-wise decomposition that breaks each multi-step trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories corresponding to each action by the original model. It then applies synthetic data filtering and RL optimization on these sub-trajectories. We evaluated SWiRL on a number of multi-step tool use, question answering, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that SWiRL outperforms baseline approaches by 21.5%, 12.3%, 14.8%, 11.1%, and 15.3% in relative accuracy on GSM8K, HotPotQA, CofCA, MuSiQue, and BeerQA, respectively.

To address these challenges, we propose Debate Only When Necessary (DOWN), an adaptive multiagent debate framework that selectively activates the debate process based on the confidence score of the agent's initial response. For queries where debate is triggered, agents refine their outputs using responses from participating agents and their confidence scores. Experimental results demonstrate that this mechanism significantly improves efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of existing multiagent debate systems. We also find that confidence-guided debate mitigates error propagation and enhances the selective incorporation of reliable responses. These results establish DOWN as an optimization strategy for efficient and effective multiagent reasoning, facilitating the practical deployment of LLM-based collaboration."}

AI developers could demonstrate that their control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks, the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.\nIn this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs, highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating misalignment risk."}

The results demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively complement Large Language Models in the protocol design process, serving as an auxiliary module in the realm of machine-assisted scientific exploration.'}

We describe our implementation with the eICU database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent. Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and Accountability.

While numerous scalable oversight protocols have been proposed, they lack a systematic empirical framework to evaluate and compare them. While recent works have tried to empirically study scalable oversight protocols -- particularly Debate -- we argue that the experiments they conduct are not generalizable to other protocols. We introduce the scalable oversight benchmark, a principled framework for evaluating human feedback mechanisms based on our agent score difference (ASD) metric, a measure of how effectively a mechanism advantages truth-telling over deception. We supply a Python package to facilitate rapid and competitive evaluation of scalable oversight protocols on our benchmark, and conduct a demonstrative experiment benchmarking Debate.'}

These kind of scenarios are common in human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.'}

Recent reward-based optimization algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have achieved significant performance on reasoning tasks, whereas preference-based optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) significantly improve the performance of LLMs on human alignment. However, despite the strong performance of reward-based optimization methods in alignment tasks , they remain vulnerable to reward hacking. Furthermore, preference-based algorithms (such as Online DPO) haven't yet matched the performance of reward-based optimization algorithms (like PPO) on reasoning tasks, making their exploration in this specific area still a worthwhile pursuit. Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Trust Region Preference Approximation (TRPA) algorithm, which integrates rule-based optimization with preference-based optimization for reasoning tasks. As a preference-based algorithm, TRPA naturally eliminates the reward hacking issue. TRPA constructs preference levels using predefined rules, forms corresponding preference pairs, and leverages a novel optimization algorithm for RL training with a theoretical monotonic improvement guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that TRPA not only achieves competitive performance on reasoning tasks but also exhibits robust stability.

Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and non-transferable across LLMs or tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to discover good LLM agent configurations. Our method frames this as a structured AutoML problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space. We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across three tasks and six LLMs (ranging from 8B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy gains ($9.5\\pm17.5$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.'}

Using agentic AI frameworks in geospatial applications can amass thousands of dollars in API charges or requires expensive, power-intensive GPUs for deployment, creating barriers for researchers, policymakers, and NGOs. Unfortunately, when geospatial Copilots are deployed with open language models (OLMs), performance often degrades due to their dependence on GPT-optimized logic. In this paper, we present Geo-OLM, a tool-augmented geospatial agent that leverages the novel paradigm of state-driven LLM reasoning to decouple task progression from tool calling. By alleviating the workflow reasoning burden, our approach enables low-resource OLMs to complete geospatial tasks more effectively. When downsizing to small models below 7B parameters, Geo-OLM outperforms the strongest prior geospatial baselines by 32.8% in successful query completion rates. Our method performs comparably to proprietary models achieving results within 10% of GPT-4o, while reducing inference costs by two orders of magnitude from \\$500-\\$1000 to under \\$10.

Current systems often rely on agents self-monitoring or correcting issues after the fact, but they lack mechanisms for real-time oversight. This paper introduces the Enforcement Agent (EA) Framework, which embeds dedicated supervisory agents into the environment to monitor others, detect misbehavior, and intervene through real-time correction. We implement this framework in a custom drone simulation and evaluate it across 90 episodes using 0, 1, and 2 EA configurations. Results show that adding EAs significantly improves system safety: success rates rise from 0.0% with no EA to 7.4% with one EA and 26.7% with two EAs. The system also demonstrates increased operational longevity and higher rates of malicious drone reformation. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, real-time supervision for enhancing alignment and resilience in multi-agent systems.'}

Building upon the foundation laid by [1], we extend their work to address the non-preemptive scheduling problem, which is known to be NP-hard. By modeling this scheduling challenge as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we develop an RL agent capable of generating near-optimal schedules for real-time MC systems. Our RL-based scheduler prioritizes high-critical tasks while maintaining overall system performance.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. The RL scheduler significantly improves task completion rates, achieving around 80% overall and 85% for high-criticality tasks across 100,000 instances of synthetic data and real data under varying system conditions. Moreover, under stable conditions without degradation, the scheduler achieves 94% overall task completion and 93% for high-criticality tasks. These results highlight the potential of RL-based schedulers in real-time and safety-critical applications, offering substantial improvements in handling complex and dynamic scheduling scenarios.'}

With the ability to access various tools, they can operate within an open-ended action space. However, with the increase in autonomy and ability, unforeseen risks also arise. In this work, we investigated one particular risk, i.e., cyber attack vulnerability of medical AI agents, as agents have access to the Internet through web browsing tools. We revealed that through adversarial prompts embedded on webpages, cyberattackers can: i) inject false information into the agent's response; ii) they can force the agent to manipulate recommendation (e.g., healthcare products and services); iii) the attacker can also steal historical conversations between the user and agent, resulting in the leak of sensitive/private medical information; iv) furthermore, the targeted agent can also cause a computer system hijack by returning a malicious URL in its response. Different backbone LLMs were examined, and we found such cyber attacks can succeed in agents powered by most mainstream LLMs, with the reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1 being the most vulnerable."}

The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources, and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs. However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.\nThe described MCP server auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, is freely available at: this https URL"}

We also examine how interaction depth and ability of planning influence malicious AI Assistants' manipulative strategies and effectiveness. Using a controlled experimental design, we simulate interactions between AI Assistants (both benign and deliberately malicious) and users across eight decision-making scenarios of varying complexity and stakes. Our methodology employs two state-of-the-art language models to generate interaction data and implements Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP) to detect malicious AI Assistants. The findings reveal that malicious AI Assistants employ domain-specific persona-tailored manipulation strategies, exploiting simulated users' vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. In particular, simulated users demonstrate resistance to manipulation initially, but become increasingly vulnerable to malicious AI Assistants as the depth of the interaction increases, highlighting the significant risks associated with extended engagement with potentially manipulative systems. IAP detection methods achieve high precision with zero false positives but struggle to detect many malicious AI Assistants, resulting in high false negative rates. These findings underscore critical risks in human-AI interactions and highlight the need for robust, context-sensitive safeguards against manipulative AI behaviour in increasingly autonomous decision-support systems."}

Despite extensive research efforts in optimizing constant-curvature pipe routing, the growing demand for free-form pipes poses new challenges. Dynamic design environments and fuzzy layout rules further impact the optimization performance and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a self-learning-based method (SLPR) for optimizing free-form pipe routing in aeroengines. The SLPR is based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm and integrates a unified rule modeling framework for efficient obstacle detection and fuzzy rule modeling in continuous space. Additionally, a potential energy table is constructed to enable rapid queries of layout tendencies and interference. The agent within SLPR iteratively refines pipe routing and accumulates the design knowledge through interaction with the environment. Once the design environment shifts, the agent can swiftly adapt by fine-tuning network parameters. Comparative tests reveal that SLPR ensures smooth pipe routing through cubic non-uniform B-spline (NURBS) curves, avoiding redundant pipe segments found in constant-curvature pipe routing. Results in both static and dynamic design environments demonstrate that SLPR outperforms three representative baselines in terms of the pipe length reduction, the adherence to layout rules, the path complexity, and the computational efficiency. Furthermore, tests in dynamic environments indicate that SLPR eliminates labor-intensive searches from scratch and even yields superior solutions compared to the retrained model. These results highlight the practical value of SLPR for real-world pipe routing, meeting lightweight, precision, and sustainability requirements of the modern aeroengine design.'}
