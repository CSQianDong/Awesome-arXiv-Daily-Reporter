**Abstract**: We interact with computers on an everyday basis, be it in everyday life or work, and many aspects of work can be done entirely with access to a computer and the Internet. At the same time, thanks to improvements in large language models (LLMs), there has also been a rapid development in AI agents that interact with and affect change in their surrounding environments. But how performant are AI agents at helping to accelerate or even autonomously perform work-related tasks? The answer to this question has important implications for both industry looking to adopt AI into their workflows, and for economic policy to understand the effects that adoption of AI may have on the labor market. To measure the progress of these LLM agents' performance on performing real-world professional tasks, in this paper, we introduce TheAgentCompany, an extensible benchmark for evaluating AI agents that interact with the world in similar ways to those of a digital worker: by browsing the Web, writing code, running programs, and communicating with other coworkers. We build a self-contained environment with internal web sites and data that mimics a small software company environment, and create a variety of tasks that may be performed by workers in such a company. We test baseline agents powered by both closed API-based and open-weights language models (LMs), and find that with the most competitive agent, 24% of the tasks can be completed autonomously. This paints a nuanced picture on task automation with LM agents -- in a setting simulating a real workplace, a good portion of simpler tasks could be solved autonomously, but more difficult long-horizon tasks are still beyond the reach of current systems. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们日常生活中与计算机的交互无处不在，无论是日常生活还是工作中，许多工作都可以通过计算机和互联网来完成。同时，由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的改进，与环境互动并对其产生影响的人工智能代理也得到了迅速发展。但这些AI代理在帮助加速甚至自主完成与工作相关任务方面表现如何？这个问题的答案对于希望将AI融入其工作流程的行业以及了解AI采用可能对劳动力市场产生的影响的经济政策都有重要意义。为了衡量这些LLM代理在执行真实世界专业任务方面的性能进步，我们在本文中介绍了TheAgentCompany，这是一个可扩展的基准测试方法，用于评估以类似于数字员工的方式与世界交互的AI代理：通过浏览网络、编写代码、运行程序和与其他同事沟通。我们构建了一个自包含的环境，其中包含模拟小型软件公司环境的内部网站和数据，并创建了由此类公司员工可能执行的各种任务。我们测试了基于闭源API和开源权重语言模型（LMs）的基线代理，并发现使用最竞争性的代理时，有24%的任务可以自主完成。这在模拟真实工作场所的环境中描绘了一幅复杂的工作任务自动化图景——许多简单任务可以自主解决，但更复杂、长期的任务仍超出了当前系统的处理能力。
