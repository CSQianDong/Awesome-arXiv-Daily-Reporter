However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.'}

Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.'}

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources.

As a result, how to check their outputs effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources, such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths. Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%.'}

We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances.

Sequential prompting methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii) structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under the strict pass@1 protocol.'}

However, their synergistic potential and underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.'}

Rossi, Nesreen K. Ahmed', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24469', 'abstract': "Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus. Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic."}

However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential."}

To address this limitation, we propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a 3$\\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale model fine-tuning.

We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore, ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction scripts that can evolve as models improve.

Objectives: With the recent advances in the field of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime, without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case.

This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents."}

Traditional software development methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous learning. To address this methodological gap, we present "Agentsway" a novel software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning, prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process. By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies.

To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases."}

Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.'}

Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors."}

In this paper, we identify the semantic alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.

We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA 8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions), and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies, and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive domains.'}

This paper introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.'}

Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs) techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective replies.'}

LLMs can retrieve relevant medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However, current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.'}

However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07% relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning, reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100% inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately. To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use evaluation.'}

Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

Based on this approach, we introduce PRDBench, a novel benchmark comprising 50 real-world Python projects across 20 domains, each with structured Product Requirement Document (PRD) requirements, comprehensive evaluation criteria, and reference implementations. PRDBench features rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of various test types beyond unit tests. Extensive experiments on PRDBench demonstrate its effectiveness in assessing the capabilities of both code agents and evaluation agents, providing a scalable and robust framework for annotation and evaluation.'}

While research has focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs recognise the limits of their own knowledge.'}

In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types.

We apply this extended framework to a real-world task, comparing its performance with a benchmark developed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) for CSA clause extraction. Our results show that CDMizer, when integrated with a significantly smaller, open-source Large Language Model (LLM), achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency against larger, proprietary models.
