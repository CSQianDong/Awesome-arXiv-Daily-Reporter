Pan, Yichi Zhang, Yushan Zhu, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13631', 'abstract': 'Multi-modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) have been widely applied across various domains for knowledge representation. However, the existing MMKGs are significantly fewer than required, and their construction faces numerous challenges, particularly in ensuring the selection of high-quality, contextually relevant images for knowledge graph enrichment. To address these challenges, we present a framework for constructing MMKGs from conventional KGs. Furthermore, to generate higher-quality images that are more relevant to the context in the given knowledge graph, we designed a neighbor selection method called Visualizable Structural Neighbor Selection (VSNS). This method consists of two modules: Visualizable Neighbor Selection (VNS) and Structural Neighbor Selection (SNS). The VNS module filters relations that are difficult to visualize, while the SNS module selects neighbors that most effectively capture the structural characteristics of the entity. To evaluate the quality of the generated images, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations on two datasets, MKG-Y and DB15K. The experimental results indicate that using the VSNS method to select neighbors results in higher-quality images that are more relevant to the knowledge graph.'}

However, instructing LLMs using natural language is limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent, leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring, and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks.

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at this https URL and its ROS inference version at this https URL.'}

Existing models often struggle with unpredictable, out-of-label hazards due to their reliance on predefined object categories. In this paper, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates vision-language reasoning with zero-shot object detection to improve hazard identification and explanation. Our pipeline consists of a Vision-Language Model (VLM), a Large Language Model (LLM), in order to detect hazardous objects within a traffic scene. We refine object detection by incorporating OpenAI's CLIP model to match predicted hazards with bounding box annotations, improving localization accuracy. To assess model performance, we create a ground truth dataset by denoising and extending the foundational COOOL (Challenge-of-Out-of-Label) anomaly detection benchmark dataset with complete natural language descriptions for hazard annotations. We define a means of hazard detection and labeling evaluation on the extended dataset using cosine similarity. This evaluation considers the semantic similarity between the predicted hazard description and the annotated ground truth for each video. Additionally, we release a set of tools for structuring and managing large-scale hazard detection datasets. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current vision-language-based approaches, offering insights into future improvements in autonomous hazard detection systems.

Karen Liu, Li Fei-Fei, Jie Tan, Jacky Liang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13351', 'abstract': 'Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

However, their integration introduces a new attack surface for social engineering. In this paper, we systematically investigate the feasibility of orchestrating AR-driven Social Engineering attacks using Multimodal LLM for the first time, via our proposed SEAR framework, which operates through three key phases: (1) AR-based social context synthesis, which fuses Multimodal inputs (visual, auditory and environmental cues); (2) role-based Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), which dynamically retrieves and integrates contextual data while preserving character differentiation; and (3) ReInteract social engineering agents, which execute adaptive multiphase attack strategies through inference interaction loops. To verify SEAR, we conducted an IRB-approved study with 60 participants in three experimental configurations (unassisted, AR+LLM, and full SEAR pipeline) compiling a new dataset of 180 annotated conversations in simulated social scenarios. Our results show that SEAR is highly effective at eliciting high-risk behaviors (e.g., 93.3% of participants susceptible to email phishing). The framework was particularly effective in building trust, with 85% of targets willing to accept an attacker's call after an interaction. Also, we identified notable limitations such as ``occasionally artificial'' due to perceived authenticity gaps. This work provides proof-of-concept for AR-LLM driven social engineering attacks and insights for developing defensive countermeasures against next-generation augmented reality threats."}

To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, allowing the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance (Mirror), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs client statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage resistance. They are then evaluated in terms of both the therapist's counseling skills and the strength of the therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches."}

While current research predominantly focuses on unimodal incremental learning and multimodal incremental learning where the modalities are consistent, real-world scenarios often present data from entirely new modalities, posing additional challenges. This paper investigates the feasibility of developing a unified model capable of incremental learning across continuously evolving modal sequences. To this end, we introduce a novel paradigm called Modality Incremental Learning (MIL), where each learning stage involves data from distinct modalities. To address this task, we propose a novel framework named Harmony, designed to achieve modal alignment and knowledge retention, enabling the model to reduce the modal discrepancy and learn from a sequence of distinct modalities, ultimately completing tasks across multiple modalities within a unified framework. Our approach introduces the adaptive compatible feature modulation and cumulative modal bridging. Through constructing historical modal features and performing modal knowledge accumulation and alignment, the proposed components collaboratively bridge modal differences and maintain knowledge retention, even with solely unimodal data available at each learning this http URL components work in concert to establish effective modality connections and maintain knowledge retention, even when only unimodal data is available at each learning stage. Extensive experiments on the MIL task demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing incremental learning methods, validating its effectiveness in MIL scenarios.'}
