For instance, widely used datasets like Common Crawl do not include explicit domain labels, while manually curating labeled datasets such as The Pile is labor-intensive. Consequently, identifying an optimal pre-training data mixture remains a challenging problem, despite its significant benefits for pre-training performance. To address these challenges, we propose CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping (CLIMB), an automated framework that discovers, evaluates, and refines data mixtures in a pre-training setting. Specifically, CLIMB embeds and clusters large-scale datasets in a semantic space and then iteratively searches for optimal mixtures using a smaller proxy model and a predictor. When continuously trained on 400B tokens with this mixture, our 1B model exceeds the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B by 2.0%. Moreover, we observe that optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) yields a 5% improvement over random sampling. Finally, we introduce ClimbLab, a filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus with 20 clusters as a research playground, and ClimbMix, a compact yet powerful 400-billion-token dataset designed for efficient pre-training that delivers superior performance under an equal token budget. We analyze the final data mixture, elucidating the characteristics of an optimal data mixture. Our data is available at: this https URL'}

Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains -- Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis -- we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8x larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds on the framework of Lew et al.

Empirical evaluations on RM benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both robustness and generalization, achieving up to a 5.97% improvement in safety-critical alignment tasks compared to standard RMs. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments confirm that our refined rewards enhance alignment quality, effectively delaying reward hacking. These results demonstrate our approach as a scalable and effective enhancement for existing RMs and alignment pipelines. The code is available at EBRM.'}

Prior work has generally studied and addressed these challenges in isolation, considering only one aspect at a time, such as handling ambiguity or robustness to noise and misinformation. We instead consider multiple factors simultaneously, proposing (i) RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents), a new dataset that simulates complex and realistic scenarios for conflicting evidence for a user query, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise; and (ii) MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach in which LLM agents debate over the merits of an answer over multiple rounds, allowing an aggregator to collate responses corresponding to disambiguated entities while discarding misinformation and noise, thereby handling diverse sources of conflict jointly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MADAM-RAG using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs -- which requires presenting all valid answers for ambiguous queries -- improving over strong RAG baselines by up to 11.40% and on FaithEval -- which requires suppressing misinformation -- where we improve by up to 15.80% (absolute) with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct. Furthermore, we find that RAMDocs poses a challenge for existing RAG baselines (Llama3.3-70B-Instruct only obtains 32.60 exact match score).

The analysis is further extended to four large language models (LLMs): GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen, and Claude. Our results reveal a counterintuitive trend: models with higher technical accuracy often exhibit lower agreement with domain experts, whereas LLMs demonstrate greater expert alignment despite relatively lower accuracy scores. To quantify and interpret model-expert agreement, we employ Cohen's Kappa, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and SHAP-based explainability techniques. Findings indicate that expert-aligned models tend to rely more on contextual and temporal language cues, rather than location-specific keywords. These results underscore that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating models in safety-critical NLP applications. We advocate for incorporating expert agreement as a complementary metric in model evaluation frameworks and highlight the promise of LLMs as interpretable, scalable tools for crash analysis pipelines."}

This approach extracts the pertinent content while avoiding unnecessary details, thereby mitigating the challenge of token limits. Moreover, our framework optimizes token usage by deleting unrelated parts of the text and ensuring that the model generates output strictly based on the given aspect.

Studies have also witnessed the importance of integrating various modalities with the existing LLMs for a better understanding of complex clinical contexts, which are innately multi-faceted by nature. Although studies have demonstrated the ability of multimodal LLMs in histopathology to answer questions from given images, they lack in understanding of thorough clinical context due to the patch-level data with limited information from public datasets. Thus, developing WSI-level MLLMs is significant in terms of the scalability and applicability of MLLMs in histopathology. In this study, we introduce an expert-level MLLM for histopathology using WSIs, dubbed as ChatEXAONEPath. We present a retrieval-based data generation pipeline using 10,094 pairs of WSIs and histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We also showcase an AI-based evaluation protocol for a comprehensive understanding of the medical context from given multimodal information and evaluate generated answers compared to the original histopathology reports. We demonstrate the ability of diagnosing the given histopathology images using ChatEXAONEPath with the acceptance rate of 62.9% from 1,134 pairs of WSIs and reports.

Through systematic causal tracing experiments on OLMo architectures (1B and 7B parameters), we identify the critical role of the first few transformer layers (layers 0-5) in storing subject-attribute associations within MLP modules. Building on this insight, we develop a constrained optimization approach that freezes upper layers while applying a novel joint loss function to lower layers-simultaneously maximizing forget set loss via output token cross-entropy penalties and minimizing retain set deviation through adaptive regularization. Our method achieves 2nd place in the 1B model track, demonstrating strong task performance while maintaining 88% of baseline MMLU accuracy.

In this work, we analyze how LLMs navigate knowledge conflicts from an information-theoretic perspective and reveal that when conflicting and supplementary information exhibit significant differences, LLMs confidently resolve their preferences.

Extensive experiments on single-choice, open-ended question-answering (QA), and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficacy of Swin-VIB.

This surge has spurred the evolution of a plethora of prompt-based reasoning frameworks. A recent focus has been on iterative reasoning strategies that refine outputs through self-evaluation and verbalized feedback. However, these strategies require additional computational complexity to enable models to recognize and correct their mistakes, leading to a significant increase in their cost. In this work, we introduce the concept of ``retrials without feedback'', an embarrassingly simple yet powerful mechanism for enhancing reasoning frameworks by allowing LLMs to retry problem-solving attempts upon identifying incorrect answers. Unlike conventional iterative refinement methods, our method does not require explicit self-reflection or verbalized feedback, simplifying the refinement process. Our findings indicate that simpler retrial-based approaches often outperform more sophisticated reasoning frameworks, suggesting that the benefits of complex methods may not always justify their computational costs. By challenging the prevailing assumption that more intricate reasoning strategies inherently lead to better performance, our work offers new insights into how simpler, more efficient approaches can achieve optimal results.

Moreover, these benchmarks are susceptible to data leakage, short-circuiting, and risk making the evaluation a priori identifiable. To address these limitations, we introduce MLRBench, a new synthetic benchmark for multilingual long-context reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks, MLRBench goes beyond surface-level retrieval by including tasks that assess multi-hop inference, aggregation, and epistemic reasoning. Spanning seven languages, MLRBench is designed to be parallel, resistant to leakage, and scalable to arbitrary context lengths. Our extensive experiments with an open-weight large language model (LLM) reveal a pronounced gap between high- and low-resource languages, particularly for tasks requiring the model to aggregate multiple facts or predict the absence of information.

For the critique generation part, we built a system that combines Noel Carroll's evaluative framework with a broad selection of art criticism theories. The model was prompted to first write a full-length critique and then shorter, more coherent versions using a step-by-step prompting process. These AI-generated critiques were then compared with those written by human experts in a Turing test-style evaluation. In many cases, human subjects had difficulty telling which was which, and the results suggest that LLMs can produce critiques that are not only plausible in style but also rich in interpretation, as long as they are carefully guided. In the second part, we introduced new simple ToM tasks based on situations involving interpretation, emotion, and moral tension, which can appear in the context of art. These go beyond standard false-belief tests and allow for more complex, socially embedded forms of reasoning. We tested 41 recent LLMs and found that their performance varied across tasks and models. In particular, tasks that involved affective or ambiguous situations tended to reveal clearer differences. Taken together, these results help clarify how LLMs respond to complex interpretative challenges, revealing both their cognitive limitations and potential. While our findings do not directly contradict the so-called Generative AI Paradox--the idea that LLMs can produce expert-like output without genuine understanding--they suggest that, depending on how LLMs are instructed, such as through carefully designed prompts, these models may begin to show behaviors that resemble understanding more closely than we might assume."}

As the negative behavior of these models has severe consequences for society and individuals, industry and academia are actively developing methods to reduce the bias in LMs. However, there are many under-represented groups and languages that have been overlooked so far. This includes marginalized groups that are specific to individual countries and regions in the English speaking and Western world, but crucially also almost all marginalized groups in the rest of the world. The UN estimates, that between 600 million to 1.2 billion people worldwide are members of marginalized groups and in need for special protection. If we want to develop inclusive LMs that work for everyone, we have to broaden our understanding to include overlooked marginalized groups and low-resource languages and dialects.\nIn this work, we contribute to this effort with the first study investigating offensive stereotyping bias in 23 LMs for 270 marginalized groups from Egypt, the remaining 21 Arab countries, Germany, the UK, and the US. Additionally, we investigate the impact of low-resource languages and dialects on the study of bias in LMs, demonstrating the limitations of current bias metrics, as we measure significantly higher bias when using the Egyptian Arabic dialect versus Modern Standard Arabic. Our results show, LMs indeed show higher bias against many marginalized groups in comparison to dominant groups. However, this is not the case for Arabic LMs, where the bias is high against both marginalized and dominant groups in relation to religion and ethnicity.\nOur results also show higher intersectional bias against Non-binary, LGBTQIA+ and Black women.'}

Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers effectively function as subsequence embedding models, with linear layers encoding input-output associations. We propose a tracing algorithm that identifies causal subsequences by analyzing hallucination probabilities across randomized input contexts.

In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch.

To tackle these issues, we propose GRAIL (GRadient-based AdaptIve unLearning), a novel multi-domain unlearning framework. GRAIL leverages gradient information from multiple domains to precisely distinguish the unlearning scope from the retention scope, and applies an adaptive parameter-wise localization strategy to selectively remove targeted knowledge while preserving critical parameters for each domain.

However,retrieved documents often include information that is either irrelevant to answering the query or misleading due to factual incorrect content, despite having high relevance scores. This behavior indicates that abstractive compressors are more likely to omit important information essential for the correct answer, especially in long contexts where attention dispersion occurs. To address this issue, we categorize retrieved documents in a more fine-grained manner and propose Abstractive Compression Robust against Noise (ACoRN), which introduces two novel training steps. First, we use offline data augmentation on the training dataset to enhance compressor robustness against two distinct types of retrieval noise. Second, since the language modelbased compressor cannot fully utilize information from multiple retrieved documents and exhibits positional bias, we perform finetuning to generate summaries centered around key information that directly supports the correct answer. Our experiments demonstrate that T5-large, trained with ACoRN as a compressor, improves EM and F1 scores while preserving the answer string, which could serve as direct evidence. ACoRN excels on datasets with many accuracy-reducing documents, making it highly useful in real-world scenarios.'}

Our approach scalably extends to arbitrarily long context lengths, unconstrained by the length of available real-world data, which effectively addresses the scarcity of raw long-context data.

In this work, we show that, in at least some cases, LLMs actually compute the information needed to perform these tasks correctly, and we identify some interventions that can allow them to access this information to improve their performance. First, we show that simply prompting the language model to not rely on its prior knowledge leads to dramatic improvements in prior-dominated tasks. We then use mechanistic interpretability techniques to localize the prior within the LLM and manipulate the extent to which that prior influences its responses. Specifically, we show that it is possible to identify layers of the underlying neural network that correlate with the prior probability of a response and that lightweight finetuning of these layers with basic prompts on prior-dominated tasks achieves high performance on held-out answers. These results suggest that the information required to produce a correct response is contained within the representations of the problems formed by the models. Furthermore, we show that this finetuning is significantly more effective for prior-dominated tasks, and that the error after finetuning is no longer correlated with the prior. Our results suggest that it may be possible to define effective methods for manipulating the extent to which LLMs rely upon their priors in solving problems, potentially increasing their performance in settings where LLMs hallucinate for reasons related to the prior probability of token sequences.'}

To address this, we propose MetaSynth, a method for generating synthetic data that enhances diversity through meta-prompting, where a language model orchestrates multiple "expert" LLM agents to collaboratively generate data. Using only 25 million tokens of synthetic data generated with MetaSynth, we successfully adapt a well-trained LLM (Mistral-7B-v0.3) to two specialized domains-Finance and Biomedicine-without compromising the capabilities of the resulting model in general tasks. In addition, we evaluate the diversity of our synthetic data using seven automated metrics, and find that it approaches the diversity of LLM pre-training corpora.\nContinually pre-training Mistral-7B-v0.3 with MetaSynth notably outperforms the base LLM, showing improvements of up to 4.08% in Finance and 13.75% in Biomedicine. The same model shows degraded performance when trained on data generated using a template prompt, even when the template includes prior generations and varying In-Context exemplars of real data.

Using open-ended tasks that require no human intervention, we find counterintuitive results: although preference-tuned models--especially those trained via RL--exhibit reduced lexical and syntactic diversity, they produce greater effective semantic diversity than SFT or base models, not from increasing diversity among high-quality outputs, but from generating more high-quality outputs overall. We discover that preference tuning reduces syntactic diversity while preserving semantic diversity--revealing a distinction between diversity in form and diversity in content that traditional metrics often overlook.

Smith, Sarah Wiegreffe, Yanai Elazar', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12459', 'abstract': "Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some concepts are encoded `linearly' in the representations, but what factors cause these representations to form? We study the connection between pretraining data frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations. We find evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations. This is the case across all phases of pretraining. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J, we discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during pretraining. Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds."}

Yet, an often-overlooked (and seldom paid) expense is the human labor behind these models' training data. Every LLM is built on an unfathomable amount of human effort: trillions of carefully written words sourced from books, academic papers, codebases, social media, and more. This position paper aims to assign a monetary value to this labor and argues that the most expensive part of producing an LLM should be the compensation provided to training data producers for their work. To support this position, we study 64 LLMs released between 2016 and 2024, estimating what it would cost to pay people to produce their training datasets from scratch. Even under highly conservative estimates of wage rates, the costs of these models' training datasets are 10-1000 times larger than the costs to train the models themselves, representing a significant financial liability for LLM providers. In the face of the massive gap between the value of training data and the lack of compensation for its creation, we highlight and discuss research directions that could enable fairer practices in the future."}

Traditional defenses focus on explicit token-level anomalies and therefore overlook semantic backdoors-covert triggers embedded at the conceptual level (e.g., ideological stances or cultural references) that rely on meaning-based cues rather than lexical oddities. We first show, in a controlled finetuning setting, that such semantic backdoors can be implanted with only a small poisoned corpus, establishing their practical feasibility. We then formalize the notion of semantic backdoors in LLMs and introduce a black-box detection framework, RAVEN (short for "Response Anomaly Vigilance for uncovering semantic backdoors"), which combines semantic entropy with cross-model consistency analysis. The framework probes multiple models with structured topic-perspective prompts, clusters the sampled responses via bidirectional entailment, and flags anomalously uniform outputs; cross-model comparison isolates model-specific anomalies from corpus-wide biases. Empirical evaluations across diverse LLM families (GPT-4o, Llama, DeepSeek, Mistral) uncover previously undetected semantic backdoors, providing the first proof-of-concept evidence of these hidden vulnerabilities and underscoring the urgent need for concept-level auditing of deployed language models.

To address these challenges, we propose an LLM-based text-to-speech Generation approach Optimized via a novel dual-branch ArchiTecture (GOAT-TTS). Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) The modality-alignment branch combines a speech encoder and projector to capture continuous acoustic embeddings, enabling bidirectional correlation between paralinguistic features (language, timbre, emotion) and semantic text representations without transcript dependency; (2) The speech-generation branch employs modular fine-tuning on top-k layers of an LLM for speech token prediction while freezing the bottom-k layers to preserve foundational linguistic knowledge.

While NLI has developed many sub-directions such as sentence-level NLI, document-level NLI and cross-lingual NLI, Cross-Document Cross-Lingual NLI (CDCL-NLI) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for CDCL-NLI that extends traditional NLI capabilities to multi-document, multilingual scenarios. To support this task, we construct a high-quality CDCL-NLI dataset including 1,110 instances and spanning 26 languages. To build a baseline for this task, we also propose an innovative method that integrates RST-enhanced graph fusion and interpretability prediction. Our method employs RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) on RGAT (Relation-aware Graph Attention Network) for cross-document context modeling, coupled with a structure-aware semantic alignment mechanism based on lexical chains for cross-lingual understanding. For NLI interpretability, we develop an EDU-level attribution framework that generates extractive explanations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance, achieving significant improvements over both traditional NLI models such as DocNLI and R2F, as well as LLMs like Llama3 and GPT-4o. Our work sheds light on the study of NLI and will bring research interest on cross-document cross-lingual context understanding, semantic retrieval and interpretability inference.

By referencing this external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the generation of factually incorrect content and addresses hallucination issues within LLMs. Recently, there has been growing attention to improving the performance and efficiency of RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: What impact does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs? To address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs, retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes within the RAG framework. When the model scale is smaller than 8B, the integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness in small-scale LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, Mistral-7B, and LLaMA3-8B). To mitigate the fairness issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches, FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving fairness while maintaining performance.'}

In contrast, smaller LLMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LLMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LLMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LLM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LLMs assume distinct roles-Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator-to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LLMs can achieve data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents.

Despite their practical applications and exceeding user consumption, they are susceptible to jailbreaks when malicious input exploits the LM's weaknesses, causing it to deviate from its intended behavior. Current defensive strategies either classify the input prompt as adversarial or prevent LMs from generating harmful outputs. However, it is challenging to explain the reason behind the malicious nature of the jailbreak, which results in a wide variety of closed-box approaches. In this research, we propose and demonstrate that system-prompt attention from Small Language Models (SLMs) can be used to characterize adversarial prompts, providing a novel, explainable, and cheaper defense approach called AttentionDefense. Our research suggests that the attention mechanism is an integral component in understanding and explaining how LMs respond to malicious input that is not captured in the semantic meaning of text embeddings. The proposed AttentionDefense is evaluated against existing jailbreak benchmark datasets. Ablation studies show that SLM-based AttentionDefense has equivalent or better jailbreak detection performance compared to text embedding-based classifiers and GPT-4 zero-shot this http URL further validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we generate a dataset of novel jailbreak variants of the existing benchmark dataset using a closed-loop LLM-based multi-agent system.

Additionally, for practical purposes AttentionDefense is an ideal solution as it has the computation requirements of a small LM but the performance of a LLM detector."}

However, it remains unclear whether LLMs have become more creative over time, and how consistent their creative output is. In this study, we evaluated 14 widely used LLMs -- including GPT-4, Claude, Llama, Grok, Mistral, and DeepSeek -- across two validated creativity assessments: the Divergent Association Task (DAT) and the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Contrary to expectations, we found no evidence of increased creative performance over the past 18-24 months, with GPT-4 performing worse than in previous studies. For the more widely used AUT, all models performed on average better than the average human, with GPT-4o and o3-mini performing best. However, only 0.28% of LLM-generated responses reached the top 10% of human creativity benchmarks. Beyond inter-model differences, we document substantial intra-model variability: the same LLM, given the same prompt, can produce outputs ranging from below-average to original. This variability has important implications for both creativity research and practical applications. Ignoring such variability risks misjudging the creative potential of LLMs, either inflating or underestimating their capabilities. The choice of prompts affected LLMs differently. Our findings underscore the need for more nuanced evaluation frameworks and highlight the importance of model selection, prompt design, and repeated assessment when using Generative AI (GenAI) tools in creative contexts.'}

We validated our approach using the open-source COBOT Magic Robot platform. Policies pre-trained on RoboTwin-generated data and fine-tuned with limited real-world samples demonstrate significant potential for enhancing dual-arm robotic manipulation systems by improving success rates by over 70% for single-arm tasks and over 40% for dual-arm tasks compared to models trained solely on real-world data.'}

Nurminen, Linda Mannila', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13038', 'abstract': "The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs, but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling."}

The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use cases--including a case based on real IT specialist dialogues--comparative evaluation with existing tools, and its advantages and limitations."}

While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and modality-of-thought (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech.

However, they require a huge memory space to store the contextual representation for all the document tokens. Some works have proposed using either heuristics or statistical-based techniques to prune tokens from each document. This however doesn't guarantee that the removed tokens have no impact on the retrieval score. Our work uses a principled approach to define how to prune tokens without impacting the score between a document and a query. We introduce three regularization losses, that induce a solution with high pruning ratios, as well as two pruning strategies. We study them experimentally (in and out-domain), showing that we can preserve ColBERT's performance while using only 30\\% of the tokens."}

We show that both LLMs with search capabilities and SOTA web agents struggle with these tasks, with a recall of 3% and 31%, respectively, despite higher performance on question-answering tasks.\nTo address this challenge, we propose BardeenAgent, a novel framework that enables web agents to convert their execution into repeatable programs, and replay them at scale across pages with similar structure. BardeenAgent is also the first LLM agent to take advantage of the regular structure of HTML. In particular BardeenAgent constructs a generalizable CSS selector to capture all relevant items on the page, then fits the operations to extract the data.\nOn the WebLists benchmark, BardeenAgent achieves 66% recall overall, more than doubling the performance of SOTA web agents, and reducing cost per output row by 3x.'}

To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines.

Researchers have attempted to migrate Transformers to graph learning, but most advanced Graph Transformers are designed with major architectural differences, either integrating message-passing or incorporating sophisticated attention mechanisms. These complexities prevent the easy adoption of Transformer training advances. We propose three simple modifications to the plain Transformer to render it applicable to graphs without introducing major architectural distortions. Specifically, we advocate for the use of (1) simplified $L_2$ attention to measure the magnitude closeness of tokens; (2) adaptive root-mean-square normalization to preserve token magnitude information; and (3) a relative positional encoding bias with a shared encoder. Significant performance gains across a variety of graph datasets justify the effectiveness of our proposed modifications. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on the expressiveness benchmark reveals noteworthy realized expressiveness in the graph isomorphism.'}

Steganography, a technique for embedding secret messages within innocuous carriers, enables covert communication over monitored channels. Provably Secure Steganography (PSS) is state of the art for making stego carriers indistinguishable from normal ones by ensuring computational indistinguishability between stego and cover distributions. However, current PSS methods often require explicit access to the distribution of generative model for both sender and receiver, limiting their practicality in black box scenarios. In this paper, we propose a provably secure steganography scheme that does not require access to explicit model distributions for both sender and receiver. Our method incorporates a dynamic sampling strategy, enabling generative models to embed secret messages within multiple sampling choices without disrupting the normal generation process of the model. Extensive evaluations of three real world datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that our blackbox method is comparable with existing white-box steganography methods in terms of efficiency and capacity while eliminating the degradation of steganography in model generated outputs.'}

ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar's Dice, Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging questions.

This paper presented the first dataset designed for knowledge acquisition on mass-shooting events through the application of named entity recognition (NER) techniques. It focuses on identifying key entities such as offenders, victims, locations, and criminal instruments, that are vital for legal and investigative purposes. The NER process is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) using few-shot prompting, facilitating the efficient extraction and organization of critical information from diverse sources, including news articles, police reports, and social media. Experimental results on real-world mass-shooting corpora demonstrate that GPT-4o is the most effective model for mass-shooting NER, achieving the highest Micro Precision, Micro Recall, and Micro F1-scores. Meanwhile, o1-mini delivers competitive performance, making it a resource-efficient alternative for less complex NER tasks. It is also observed that increasing the shot count enhances the performance of all models, but the gains are more substantial for GPT-4o and o1-mini, highlighting their superior adaptability to few-shot learning scenarios.'}
