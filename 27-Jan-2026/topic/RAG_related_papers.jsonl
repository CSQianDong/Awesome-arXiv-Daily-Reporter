One-pass retrieval-and-write pipelines frequently yield shallow summaries, inconsistent grounding, and weak mechanisms for completeness verification. We introduce ADORE (Adaptive Deep Orchestration for Research in Enterprise), an agentic framework that replaces linear retrieval with iterative, user-steered investigation coordinated by a central orchestrator and a set of specialized agents. ADORE's key insight is that a structured Memory Bank (a curated evidence store with explicit claim-evidence linkage and section-level admissible evidence) enables traceable report generation and systematic checks for evidence completeness. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Memory-locked synthesis - report generation is constrained to a structured Memory Bank (Claim-Evidence Graph) with section-level admissible evidence, enabling traceable claims and grounded citations; (2) Evidence-coverage-guided execution - a retrieval-reflection loop audits section-level evidence coverage to trigger targeted follow-up retrieval and terminates via an evidence-driven stopping criterion; (3) Section-packed long-context grounding - section-level packing, pruning, and citation-preserving compression make long-form synthesis feasible under context limits. Across our evaluation suite, ADORE ranks first on DeepResearch Bench (52.65) and achieves the highest head-to-head preference win rate on DeepConsult (77.2%) against commercial systems."}

To enable time-efficient insightful retrieval, we propose FastInsight. We first introduce a graph retrieval taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into three fundamental operations: vector search, graph search, and model-based search. Through this taxonomy, we identify two critical limitations in current approaches: the topology-blindness of model-based search and the semantics-blindness of graph search. FastInsight overcomes these limitations by interleaving two novel fusion operators: the Graph-based Reranker (GRanker), which functions as a graph model-based search, and Semantic-Topological eXpansion (STeX), which operates as a vector-graph search. Extensive experiments on broad retrieval and generation datasets demonstrate that FastInsight significantly improves both retrieval accuracy and generation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a substantial Pareto improvement in the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency.'}

This can lead to answers that mix trusted and untrusted content or draw on stale information. We present OwlerLite, a browser-based RAG system that makes user-defined scopes and data freshness central to retrieval. Users define reusable scopes-sets of web pages or sources-and select them when querying. A freshness-aware crawler monitors live pages, uses a semantic change detector to identify meaningful updates, and selectively re-indexes changed content. OwlerLite integrates text relevance, scope choice, and recency into a unified retrieval model. Implemented as a browser extension, it represents a step toward more controllable and trustworthy web assistants.'}

Kim, Joo-Kyung Kim', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17755', 'abstract': 'Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has been successfully applied in various knowledge-intensive question answering tasks by organizing external knowledge into structured graphs of entities and relations. It enables large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning beyond text-chunk retrieval. Recent works have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to train agentic GraphRAG frameworks that perform iterative interactions between LLMs and knowledge graphs. However, existing RL-based frameworks such as Graph-R1 suffer from two key limitations: (1) they primarily depend on semantic similarity for retrieval, often overlooking the underlying graph structure, and (2) they rely on sparse, outcome-level rewards, failing to capture the quality of intermediate retrieval steps and their dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose ProGraph-R1, a progress-aware agentic framework for graph-based retrieval and multi-step reasoning. ProGraph-R1 introduces a structure-aware hypergraph retrieval mechanism that jointly considers semantic relevance and graph connectivity, encouraging coherent traversal along multi-hop reasoning paths. We also design a progress-based step-wise policy optimization, which provides dense learning signals by modulating advantages according to intermediate reasoning progress within a graph, rather than relying solely on final outcomes. Experiments on multi-hop question answering benchmarks demonstrate that ProGraph-R1 consistently improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality over existing GraphRAG methods.'}

We show that retrieval relevance metrics (e.g., NDCG) correlate weakly with end-to-end QA quality and can even become negatively correlated under multi-passage injection, where redundancy and mild conflicts destabilize generation. We propose \\textbf{Information Gain Pruning (IGP)}, a deployment-friendly reranking-and-pruning module that selects evidence using a generator-aligned utility signal and filters weak or harmful passages before truncation, without changing existing budget interfaces. Across five open-domain QA benchmarks and multiple retrievers and generators, IGP consistently improves the quality--cost trade-off. In a representative multi-evidence setting, IGP delivers about +12--20% relative improvement in average F1 while reducing final-stage input tokens by roughly 76--79% compared to retriever-only baselines.'}

However, RAG is often challenged by reasoning-intensive question-answering (QA), since common retrieval methods like cosine similarity maximize relevance at the cost of introducing redundant content, which can reduce information recall. To address this, we introduce Diversity-Focused Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DF-RAG), which systematically incorporates diversity into the retrieval step to improve performance on complex, reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks. DF-RAG builds upon the Maximal Marginal Relevance framework to select information chunks that are both relevant to the query and maximally dissimilar from each other. A key innovation of DF-RAG is its ability to optimize the level of diversity for each query dynamically at test time without requiring any additional fine-tuning or prior information. We show that DF-RAG improves F1 performance on reasoning-intensive QA benchmarks by 4-10 percent over vanilla RAG using cosine similarity and also outperforms other established baselines. Furthermore, we estimate an Oracle ceiling of up to 18 percent absolute F1 gains over vanilla RAG, of which DF-RAG captures up to 91.3 percent.'}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and open-source Large Language Models are combined through multi-stage iterative workflows in the system's hybrid LangGraph architecture. The agent constructs an extensive Devito knowledge graph through document parsing, structure-aware segmentation, extraction of entity relationships, and Leiden-based community detection. GraphRAG optimisation enhances query performance across semantic communities that include seismic wave simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and performance tuning libraries. A reverse engineering component derives three-level query strategies for RAG retrieval through static analysis of Fortran source code. To deliver precise contextual information for language model guidance, the multi-stage retrieval pipeline performs parallel searching, concept expansion, community-scale retrieval, and semantic similarity analysis. Code synthesis is governed by Pydantic-based constraints to guarantee structured outputs and reliability. A comprehensive validation framework integrates conventional static analysis with the G-Eval approach, covering execution correctness, structural soundness, mathematical consistency, and API compliance. The overall agent workflow is implemented on the LangGraph framework and adopts concurrent processing to support quality-based iterative refinement and state-aware dynamic routing. The principal contribution lies in the incorporation of feedback mechanisms motivated by reinforcement learning, enabling a transition from static code translation toward dynamic and adaptive analytical behavior."}

In particular, while mRAG provides a practical capability to connect private datasets to improve model performance, it risks the leakage of private information from these datasets during inference. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to analyze the privacy risks inherent in the mRAG pipeline observed through standard model prompting. Specifically, we implement a case study that attempts to infer the inclusion of a visual asset, e.g. image, in the mRAG, and if present leak the metadata, e.g. caption, related to it. Our findings highlight the need for privacy-preserving mechanisms and motivate future research on mRAG privacy.'}
