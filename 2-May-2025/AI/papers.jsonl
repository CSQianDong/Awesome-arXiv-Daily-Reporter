Existing centralized IoV solutions often suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.'}

There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of {\\em leakage} and {\\em contamination} are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting. This makes AI Competitions an especially valuable (but underutilized) resource. Now is time for the field to view AI Competitions as the gold standard for empirical rigor in GenAI evaluation, and to harness and harvest their results with according value.'}

Experimental Evidence from Humans and GPT-4', 'authors': 'Phanish Puranam, Prothit Sen, Maciej Workiewicz', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00603', 'abstract': 'This study investigates whether large language models, specifically GPT4, can match human capabilities in analogical reasoning within strategic decision making contexts. Using a novel experimental design involving source to target matching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible analogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect analogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants exhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with stronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying matching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that requires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval. While current LLMs are proficient in generating candidate analogies, humans maintain a comparative advantage in recognizing deep structural similarities across domains. Error analysis reveals that AI errors arise from surface level matching, whereas human errors stem from misinterpretations of causal structure. Taken together, the results suggest a productive division of labor in AI assisted organizational decision making where LLMs may serve as broad analogy generators, while humans act as critical evaluators, applying the most contextually appropriate analogies to strategic problems.'}

Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective distribution of air purification infrastructure.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage framework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on each reasoning step of math solutions.

These failures to generalize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models. However, language models' in-context learning shows different inductive biases, and can generalize better in some of these cases. Here, we explore these differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based learning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and improve models' ability to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are constructed to isolate the knowledge in the dataset from that in pretraining, to create clean tests of generalization. We expose pretrained large models to controlled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context, or through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that require various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched settings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning (though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when fine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of knowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved generalization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning data. We show that this method improves generalization across various splits of our datasets and other benchmarks. Our results have implications for understanding the inductive biases of different modes of learning in language models, and practically improving their performance."}

Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.'}

Ensuring that the model accurately distinguishes messages from each role -- a concept we call \\emph{role separation} -- is crucial for consistent multi-role behavior. Although recent work often targets state-of-the-art prompt injection defenses, it remains unclear whether such methods truly teach LLMs to differentiate roles or merely memorize known triggers. In this paper, we examine \\emph{role-separation learning}: the process of teaching LLMs to robustly distinguish system and user tokens. Through a \\emph{simple, controlled experimental framework}, we find that fine-tuned models often rely on two proxies for role identification: (1) task type exploitation, and (2) proximity to begin-of-text. Although data augmentation can partially mitigate these shortcuts, it generally leads to iterative patching rather than a deeper fix. To address this, we propose reinforcing \\emph{invariant signals} that mark role boundaries by adjusting token-wise cues in the model's input encoding. In particular, manipulating position IDs helps the model learn clearer distinctions and reduces reliance on superficial proxies. By focusing on this mechanism-centered perspective, our work illuminates how LLMs can more reliably maintain consistent multi-role behavior without merely memorizing known prompts or triggers."}

FineScope leverages the Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) framework, inspired by its ability to produce interpretable feature representations, to extract domain-specific subsets from large datasets. We apply structured pruning with domain-specific constraints, ensuring that the resulting pruned models retain essential knowledge for the target domain. To further enhance performance, these pruned models undergo self-data distillation, leveraging SAE-curated datasets to restore key domain-specific information lost during pruning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that FineScope achieves highly competitive performance, outperforming several large-scale state-of-the-art LLMs in domain-specific tasks. Additionally, our results show that FineScope enables pruned models to regain a substantial portion of their original performance when fine-tuned with SAE-curated datasets. Furthermore, applying these datasets to fine-tune pretrained LLMs without pruning also improves their domain-specific accuracy, highlighting the robustness of our approach.

Existing methods suffer from performance degradation when extending to longer contexts. In this work, we introduce a novel context extension method that optimizes both fine-tuning and inference efficiency. Our method exploits a key observation: in the frequency domain, the energy distribution of the KV cache is primarily concentrated in low-frequency components. By filtering out the high-frequency components, the KV cache can be effectively compressed with minimal information loss. Building on this insight, we propose an efficient compression technique, FreqKV, that iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache to a fixed size in the frequency domain, applicable to both fine-tuning and inference. FreqKV introduces no additional parameters or architectural modifications. With minimal fine-tuning, LLMs can learn to leverage the limited cache that is compressed in the frequency domain and extend the context window efficiently. Experiments on various long context language modeling and understanding tasks demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method.'}

Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models learn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This behavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often scarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a challenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are available during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing modalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or specific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a common approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality combination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for clinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling pre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained model seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting rich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This allows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural changes, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of modalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy outperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate pre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training from scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and efficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value. Code and trained models are available at: this https URL'}

Despite advances in alignment and instruction tuning, LLMs can still generate outputs that are fluent yet fundamentally untrue. Understanding the cognitive dynamics that underlie these hallucinations remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to systematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing Prompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g., periodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a Hallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility, confidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple LLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more hallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied across models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from general-purpose ones. Our framework provides a reproducible testbed for studying hallucination vulnerability, and opens the door to developing safer, more introspective LLMs that can detect and self-regulate the onset of conceptual instability.'}

This study presents the first comprehensive human-centered analysis of anonymized pathological speech, using a structured perceptual protocol involving ten native and non-native German listeners with diverse linguistic, clinical, and technical backgrounds. Listeners evaluated anonymized-original utterance pairs from 180 speakers spanning Cleft Lip and Palate, Dysarthria, Dysglossia, Dysphonia, and age-matched healthy controls. Speech was anonymized using state-of-the-art automatic methods (equal error rates in the range of 30-40%). Listeners completed Turing-style discrimination and quality rating tasks under zero-shot (single-exposure) and few-shot (repeated-exposure) conditions. Discrimination accuracy was high overall (91% zero-shot; 93% few-shot), but varied by disorder (repeated-measures ANOVA: p=0.007), ranging from 96% (Dysarthria) to 86% (Dysphonia). Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality (from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns (one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners rated original speech slightly higher than non-native listeners (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference nearly disappeared after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant gender-based bias was observed. Critically, human perceptual outcomes did not correlate with automatic privacy or clinical utility metrics. These results underscore the need for listener-informed, disorder- and context-specific anonymization strategies that preserve privacy while maintaining interpretability, communicative functions, and diagnostic utility, especially for vulnerable populations such as children.'}

This becomes even more critical during anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers' delivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly. Existing studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many works focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly model abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other features, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous events occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in these scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal attention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we design an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent neural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec to model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks and long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of couriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal circumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a memory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention mechanisms. The experiments on real-world logistics datasets during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2022 show the model outperforms the best baselines by 12.11% in MAE and 13.71% in MSE, demonstrating its superior performance over multiple competitive baselines."}

This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where couriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup simultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and delivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the pickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the delivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three main challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately interconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups have stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it challenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers' spatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior, but have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT, a Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first employ the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal dependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets. Then we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the imbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as an auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior courier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on real industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A system based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more than 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in Beijing."}

The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by continuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device models. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling machine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is unsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this context, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution, preserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative updates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor autonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial tasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL employs an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and task-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining lightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices. Moreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an autonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new task has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately allows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without additional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and THUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\\rm{SacFL}$ in both class-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios.

Recently, density-based methods have gained attention. However, existing algorithms struggle to simultaneously handle arbitrarily shaped, multi-density, high-dimensional data while maintaining strong outlier resistance. Clustering quality significantly deteriorates when data density varies complexly. This paper proposes a clustering algorithm based on the novel concept of Tightest Neighbors and introduces a data stream clustering theory based on the Skeleton Set. Based on these theories, this paper develops a new method, TNStream, a fully online algorithm. The algorithm adaptively determines the clustering radius based on local similarity, summarizing the evolution of multi-density data streams in micro-clusters. It then applies a Tightest Neighbors-based clustering algorithm to form final clusters. To improve efficiency in high-dimensional cases, Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is employed to structure micro-clusters, addressing the challenge of storing k-nearest neighbors. TNStream is evaluated on various synthetic and real-world datasets using different clustering metrics. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving clustering quality for multi-density data and validate the proposed data stream clustering theory.'}

First, they rely on predetermined data domains (e.g., data sources, task types), which may fail to capture critical semantic nuances, leaving performance on the table. Second, these methods scale with the number of domains in a computationally prohibitive way. We address these challenges via R&B, a framework that re-partitions training data based on semantic similarity (Regroup) to create finer-grained domains, and efficiently optimizes the data composition (Balance) by leveraging a Gram matrix induced by domain gradients obtained throughout training. Unlike prior works, it removes the need for additional compute to obtain evaluation information such as losses or gradients. We analyze this technique under standard regularity conditions and provide theoretical insights that justify R&B's effectiveness compared to non-adaptive mixing approaches. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of R&B on five diverse datasets ranging from natural language to reasoning and multimodal tasks.

We therefore present in this work a novel type of optimizer that carries with extremely lightweight state overloads, achieved through ultra-low-precision quantization. While previous efforts have achieved certain success with 8-bit or 4-bit quantization, our approach enables optimizers to operate at precision as low as 3 bits, or even 2 bits per state element. This is accomplished by identifying and addressing two critical challenges: the signal swamping problem in unsigned quantization that results in unchanged state dynamics, and the rapidly increased gradient variance in signed quantization that leads to incorrect descent directions. The theoretical analysis suggests a tailored logarithmic quantization for the former and a precision-specific momentum value for the latter. Consequently, the proposed SOLO achieves substantial memory savings (approximately 45 GB when training a 7B model) with minimal accuracy loss. We hope that SOLO can contribute to overcoming the bottleneck in computational resources, thereby promoting greater accessibility in fundamental research.'}

Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic, pixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus overlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we introduce \\textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that systematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both open-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian mechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects.

To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up training. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art approach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a faster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid usage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant use of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter efficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a parametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video representation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework that can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the spatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information, NVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter efficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels at once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video quality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed increase of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters) and an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic), compared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks, we demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264, HEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression.

Leveraging Bayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds, the method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth contours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to classify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A calibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical accuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual labels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate cancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent, transfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were available. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all scenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34 subjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated threshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted in over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting cases needing correction.

Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for enabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed decision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions. Nonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual assessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the level of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model that leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of these events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's performance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three major utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a 2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer Satisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression metrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the outcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ interpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of incorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the contributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency, fostering greater trust in the model's capabilities."}

This black-box access is especially limiting when constructing mixture-of-expert type ensemble models since the user cannot optimize each proprietary AI's internal parameters. Our problem naturally lends itself to a non-competitive game-theoretic lens where each proprietary AI (agent) is inherently competing against the other AI agents, with this competition arising naturally due to their obliviousness of the AI's to their internal structure. In contrast, the user acts as a central planner trying to synchronize the ensemble of competing AIs.\nWe show the existence of the unique Nash equilibrium in the online setting, which we even compute in closed-form by eliciting a feedback mechanism between any given time series and the sequence generated by each (proprietary) AI agent. Our solution is implemented as a decentralized, federated-learning algorithm in which each agent optimizes their structure locally on their machine without ever releasing any internal structure to the others. We obtain refined expressions for pre-trained models such as transformers, random feature models, and echo-state networks. Our ``proprietary federated learning'' algorithm is implemented on a range of real-world and synthetic time-series benchmarks. It achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in predictive accuracy over natural benchmarks, of which there are surprisingly few due to this natural problem still being largely unexplored."}

By operating on proto-objects rather than fixed patches, we significantly reduce the representational complexity: each image decomposes into fewer proto-objects than regular patches, and each proto-object can be efficiently encoded as a compact feature vector. This enables a substantially smaller self-attention module that processes richer semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that this proto-object-based approach matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance of patch-based implementations with 62% less parameters and 2.6 times less training time.'}

However, existing clinical prediction tools remain fundamentally flawed, often overestimating recurrence risk and failing to provide personalized insights for patient management. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning framework that integrates vector embeddings and attention mechanisms to improve NMIBC recurrence prediction performance. We incorporate vector embeddings for categorical variables such as smoking status and intravesical treatments, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between patient attributes and recurrence risk. These embeddings provide a richer representation of the data, enabling improved feature interactions and enhancing prediction performance. Our approach not only enhances performance but also provides clinicians with patient-specific insights by highlighting the most influential features contributing to recurrence risk for each patient. Our model achieves accuracy of 70% with tabular data, outperforming conventional statistical methods while providing clinician-friendly patient-level explanations through feature attention. Unlike previous studies, our approach identifies new important factors influencing recurrence, such as surgical duration and hospital stay, which had not been considered in existing NMIBC prediction models.'}

Multimodal memes, often utilized for playful or humorous expressions with visual and textual elements, are sometimes misused to disseminate hate speech against individuals or groups.

Leveraging the powerful generation and reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we address the tasks of detecting and mitigating hateful content. This paper presents two key contributions: first, a definition-guided prompting technique for detecting hateful memes, and second, a unified framework for mitigating hateful content in memes, named UnHateMeme, which works by replacing hateful textual and/or visual components. With our definition-guided prompts, VLMs achieve impressive performance on hateful memes detection task. Furthermore, our UnHateMeme framework, integrated with VLMs, demonstrates a strong capability to convert hateful memes into non-hateful forms that meet human-level criteria for hate speech and maintain multimodal coherence between image and text. Through empirical experiments, we show the effectiveness of state-of-the-art pretrained VLMs such as LLaVA, Gemini and GPT-4o on the proposed tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of their respective strengths and limitations for these tasks.

However, emerging evidence suggests that longer responses can sometimes degrade accuracy rather than improve it. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study of the relationship between reasoning length and answer correctness. We find that LLMs tend to overthink simple problems, generating unnecessarily long outputs, and underthink harder ones, failing to extend their reasoning when it is most needed. This indicates that models might misjudge problem difficulty and fail to calibrate their response length appropriately. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of length reduction with a preference optimization algorithm when simply preferring the shorter responses regardless of answer correctness. Experiments show that the generation length can be significantly reduced while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our findings highlight generation length as a meaningful signal for reasoning behavior and motivate further exploration into LLMs' self-awareness in reasoning length adaptation."}

Employing a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed quantitative shifts in usage patterns and attitudes as well as qualitative narratives of student experiences.\nWhile the overall frequency of GenAI usage for homework or programming projects remained largely stable, we observed large effect sizes in comfort and openness across conceptual, debugging, and homework problems. Notably, usage patterns for debugging also shifted statistically significantly, reflecting students\' more mindful and deliberate approach. Focus group discussions corroborated these results, suggesting that the intervention "bridged the gap" between naive GenAI usage and more nuanced, reflective integration of AI tools into coursework, ultimately heightening students\' awareness of their own skill development.\nThese findings suggest that structured, scaffolded interventions can enable students to harness GenAI\'s benefits without undermining essential competencies.

In this study, we propose a Fact-Consistency Evaluation Framework for assessing the semantic accuracy of LLM-generated SQL outputs using Exaone 3.5--an instruction-tuned, bilingual LLM optimized for enterprise tasks. We construct a domain-specific benchmark comprising 219 natural language business questions across five SQL complexity levels, derived from actual sales data in LG Electronics' internal BigQuery environment. Each question is paired with a gold-standard SQL query and a validated ground-truth answer. We evaluate model performance using answer accuracy, execution success rate, semantic error rate, and non-response rate. Experimental results show that while Exaone 3.5 performs well on simple aggregation tasks (93% accuracy in L1), it exhibits substantial degradation in arithmetic reasoning (4% accuracy in H1) and grouped ranking tasks (31% in H4), with semantic errors and non-responses concentrated in complex cases. Qualitative error analysis further identifies common failure types such as misapplied arithmetic logic, incomplete filtering, and incorrect grouping operations.

However, a key question remains unaddressed: what essential information should such self-generated data encapsulate? Existing approaches only produce step-by-step problem solutions, and fail to capture the abstract meta-knowledge necessary for generalization across similar problems. Drawing insights from cognitive science, where humans employ high-level abstraction to simplify complex problems before delving into specifics, we introduce a novel self-training algorithm: LEarning to Plan before Answering (LEPA). LEPA trains the LLM to formulate anticipatory plans, which serve as abstract meta-knowledge for problem-solving, before engaging with the intricacies of problems. This approach not only outlines the solution generation path but also shields the LLM from the distraction of irrelevant details. During data generation, LEPA first crafts an anticipatory plan based on the problem, and then generates a solution that aligns with both the plan and the problem. LEPA refines the plan through self-reflection, aiming to acquire plans that are instrumental in yielding correct solutions. During model optimization, the LLM is trained to predict both the refined plans and the corresponding solutions. By efficiently extracting and utilizing the anticipatory plans, LEPA demonstrates remarkable superiority over conventional algorithms on various challenging natural language reasoning benchmarks.'}

However, these end-to-end systems face key challenges, particularly in incorporating external knowledge, a capability commonly addressed by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in text-based large language models (LLMs). The core difficulty lies in the modality gap between input speech and retrieved textual knowledge, which hinders effective integration. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end RAG framework that directly retrieves relevant textual knowledge from speech queries, eliminating the need for intermediate speech-to-text conversion via techniques like ASR. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of end-to-end S2S dialogue systems while achieving higher retrieval efficiency. Although the overall performance still lags behind cascaded models, our framework offers a promising direction for enhancing knowledge integration in end-to-end S2S systems. We will release the code and dataset to support reproducibility and promote further research in this area.'}

The high quality of trees guarantees that all subjects, actions, objects and adverbials and their subclass relations within texts can be represented. The independency of trees ensures that there is no redundant representation between trees. The expressiveness of trees ensures that the majority of sentences can be accessed from each tree and the rest of sentences can be accessed from at least one tree so that the tree-based search mechanism can support querying in natural language. Experiments show that the average precision, recall and F1-score of the abstraction trees constructed by the subclass relations of subject, action, object and adverbial are all greater than 80%. The application of the proposed approach to supporting query in natural language demonstrates that different types of question patterns for querying subject or object have high coverage of texts, and searching multiple trees on subject, action, object and adverbial according to the question pattern can quickly reduce search space to locate target sentences, which can support precise operation on texts.'}

Addressing these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient lightweight medical vertical large language model architecture method, systematically solving the lightweight problem of medical large models from three dimensions: knowledge acquisition, model compression, and computational optimization. At the knowledge acquisition level, a knowledge transfer pipeline is designed from the fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distill-70B teacher model to the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B student model, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technology is adopted to precisely adjust key attention layers. At the model compression level, compression techniques including 4-bit weight quantization are implemented while preserving the core representation ability for medical reasoning. At the computational optimization level, inference optimization techniques such as Flash Attention acceleration and continuous batching are integrated, and a professional prompt template system is constructed to adapt to different types of medical problems. Experimental results on medical question-answering datasets show that the method proposed in this paper maintains professional accuracy while reducing memory consumption by 64.7\\% and inference latency by 12.4\\%, providing an effective solution for the application of medical large models in resource-constrained environments such as edge computing devices.'}

Prior work typically enhances tool-use abilities by either applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enforce tool-call correctness or distilling reasoning traces from stronger models for SFT. However, both approaches fall short, either omitting reasoning entirely or producing imitative reasoning that limits generalization. Inspired by the success of DeepSeek-R1 in eliciting reasoning through rule-based reinforcement learning, we develop the Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 series of tool-using language models using a similar training paradigm. Instead of restrictively supervising intermediate reasoning traces distilled from stronger models, Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1 is optimized with a binary reward that evaluates only the structural validity and functional correctness of tool invocations. This lightweight supervision allows the model to autonomously internalize reasoning strategies, without the need for annotated reasoning trajectories. Experiments on the BFCL and API-Bank benchmarks show that Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-7B and Nemotron-Research-Tool-N1-14B, built on Qwen-2.5-7B/14B-Instruct, achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming GPT-4o on both evaluations.'}

Previous research has shown that language models struggle with these complexities, typically focusing on single factors in isolation. We classify these relationships into four types: distracting, ambiguous, counterfactual, and duplicated. Our analysis reveals that no single approach effectively addresses all these interrelationships simultaneously. Therefore, we introduce Context Organizer (CORG), a framework that organizes multiple contexts into independently processed groups. This design allows the model to efficiently find all relevant answers while ensuring disambiguation. CORG consists of three key components: a graph constructor, a reranker, and an aggregator. Our results demonstrate that CORG balances performance and efficiency effectively, outperforming existing grouping methods and achieving comparable results to more computationally intensive, single-context approaches.'}

Second, we introduce a Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning objective that connects SQL execution accuracy to generalizable reasoning by encouraging steps that extend beyond task-specific syntax and transfer across datasets. Empirically, our approach improves performance on standard Text-to-SQL benchmarks and achieves substantial gains on reasoning-intensive datasets such as BIRD and CRT-QA, demonstrating enhanced generalization and interpretability. Specifically, the distilled-quantized LLaMA model achieved a 20\\% increase in accuracy when trained on Text-to-SQL tasks, while Qwen achieved a 5\\% increase.
