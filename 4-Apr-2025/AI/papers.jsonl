Throughout history of science, we have witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking, but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.'}

However, when these models are deployed in high-stakes verticals such as healthcare, education, and law, they often reveal notable limitations. For instance, they exhibit brittleness to minor variations in input data, present contextually uninformed decisions in critical settings, and undermine user trust by confidently producing or reproducing inaccuracies. These challenges in applying large models necessitate cross-disciplinary innovations to align the models\' capabilities with the needs of real-world applications. We introduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction of innovations aimed at meeting users\' requirements with large models. Through multiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across various fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the pipeline of transforming large models into useful "vertical systems", we also highlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework. Finally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners to (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific insights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii) uncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across verticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing benchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical challenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain experts, and human-computer interaction scholars).'}

However, while the overall capabilities of models show promising growth, our understanding of their internal reasoning processes remains limited, particularly concerning systematic inconsistencies or errors patterns of logical or inferential flaws. These inconsistencies may manifest as contradictory outputs, failure to generalize across similar tasks, or erroneous conclusions in specific contexts. Even detecting and measuring such reasoning discrepancies is challenging, as they may arise from opaque internal procedures, biases and imbalances in training data, or the inherent complexity of the task. Without effective methods to detect, measure, and mitigate these errors, there is a risk of deploying models that are biased, exploitable, or logically unreliable. This thesis aims to address these issues by producing novel methods for deep learning models that reason over knowledge graphs, natural language, and images. The thesis contributes two techniques for detecting and quantifying predictive inconsistencies originating from opaque internal procedures in natural language and image processing models. To mitigate inconsistencies from biases in training data, this thesis presents a data efficient sampling method to improve fairness and performance and a synthetic dataset generation approach in low resource scenarios. Finally, the thesis offers two techniques to optimize the models for complex reasoning tasks. These methods enhance model performance while allowing for more faithful and interpretable exploration and exploitation during inference. Critically, this thesis provides a comprehensive framework to improve the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of deep learning models across diverse tasks and modalities.'}

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple, yet effective alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Synthetic preference data with its low cost and high quality enable effective alignment through single- or multi-model generated preference data. Our study reveals a striking, safety-specific phenomenon associated with DPO alignment: Although multi-model generated data enhances performance on general tasks (ARC, Hellaswag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, Winogrande) by providing diverse responses, it also tends to facilitate reward hacking during training. This can lead to a high attack success rate (ASR) when models encounter jailbreaking prompts. The issue is particularly pronounced when employing stronger models like GPT-4o or larger models in the same family to generate chosen responses paired with target model self-generated rejected responses, resulting in dramatically poorer safety outcomes. Furthermore, with respect to safety, using solely self-generated responses (single-model generation) for both chosen and rejected pairs significantly outperforms configurations that incorporate responses from stronger models, whether used directly as chosen data or as part of a multi-model response pool. We demonstrate that multi-model preference data exhibits high linear separability between chosen and rejected responses, which allows models to exploit superficial cues rather than internalizing robust safety constraints. Our experiments, conducted on models from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families, consistently validate these findings.'}

Inspired by the success of large foundation models (for example, large language models and large vision models) pre-trained on massive datasets, we introduce OmniCellTOSG, the first dataset of cell text-omic signaling graphs (TOSGs). Each TOSG represents the signaling network of an individual or meta-cell and is labeled with information such as organ, disease, sex, age, and cell subtype. OmniCellTOSG offers two key contributions.

This approach calls for new joint models combining large language models and graph neural networks. Second, the dataset is built from single-cell RNA sequencing data of approximately 120 million cells from diverse tissues and conditions (healthy and diseased) and is fully compatible with PyTorch.

Our experiments, conducted on thirteen open-source and closed-source LLMs, reveal that introducing irrelevant context within the model's context window significantly degrades performance, suggesting that distinguishing essential from extraneous details remains a pressing challenge. Surprisingly, performance regressions are relatively insensitive to the complexity of the reasoning task, as measured by the number of steps required, and are not strictly correlated with model size. Moreover, we observe that certain perturbations inadvertently trigger chain-of-thought-like reasoning behaviors, even without explicit prompting. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLMs and underscore the need for improved robustness against noisy, misleading, and contextually dense inputs, paving the way for more resilient and reliable reasoning in real-world applications."}

This paper introduces a functional model of epistemic closure, in which cognitive, institutional, social, and infrastructural filters combine to make many alignment proposals illegible to existing evaluation systems. We present a weighted closure model supported by both theoretical and empirical sources, including a meta-analysis performed by an AI system on patterns of rejection and non-engagement with a framework for decentralized collective intelligence (DCI). We argue that the recursive failure to assess models like DCI is not just a sociological oversight but a structural attractor, mirroring the very risks of misalignment we aim to avoid in AGI. Without the adoption of DCI or a similarly recursive model of epistemic correction, we may be on a predictable path toward irreversible misalignment. The development and acceptance of this paper, first through simulated review and then through formal channels, provide a case study supporting its central claim: that epistemic closure can only be overcome by recursive modeling of the constraints that sustain it.'}

Existing editing methods often design a representation manipulation procedure by curating an edit direction in the text embedding or score space. However, such a procedure faces a key challenge: overestimating the edit strength harms visual consistency while underestimating it fails the editing task. Notably, each source image may require a different editing strength, and it is costly to search for an appropriate strength via trial-and-error. To address this challenge, we propose Concept Lancet (CoLan), a zero-shot plug-and-play framework for principled representation manipulation in diffusion-based image editing. At inference time, we decompose the source input in the latent (text embedding or diffusion score) space as a sparse linear combination of the representations of the collected visual concepts. This allows us to accurately estimate the presence of concepts in each image, which informs the edit. Based on the editing task (replace/add/remove), we perform a customized concept transplant process to impose the corresponding editing direction. To sufficiently model the concept space, we curate a conceptual representation dataset, CoLan-150K, which contains diverse descriptions and scenarios of visual terms and phrases for the latent dictionary.

Most notably, we demonstrate that applying SAEs to intervene on a CLIP vision encoder, directly steer output from multimodal LLMs (e.g., LLaVA) without any modifications to the underlying model. These findings emphasize the practicality and efficacy of SAEs as an unsupervised approach for enhancing both the interpretability and control of VLMs.'}

Dvornek, John A. Onofrey', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02819', 'abstract': "Symmetry, where certain features remain invariant under geometric transformations, can often serve as a powerful prior in designing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While conventional CNNs inherently support translational equivariance, extending this property to rotation and reflection has proven challenging, often forcing a compromise between equivariance, efficiency, and information loss. In this work, we introduce Gaussian Mixture Ring Convolution (GMR-Conv), an efficient convolution kernel that smooths radial symmetry using a mixture of Gaussian-weighted rings. This design mitigates discretization errors of circular kernels, thereby preserving robust rotation and reflection equivariance without incurring computational overhead. We further optimize both the space and speed efficiency of GMR-Conv via a novel parameterization and computation strategy, allowing larger kernels at an acceptable cost. Extensive experiments on eight classification and one segmentation datasets demonstrate that GMR-Conv not only matches conventional CNNs' performance but can also surpass it in applications with orientation-less data. GMR-Conv is also proven to be more robust and efficient than the state-of-the-art equivariant learning methods. Our work provides inspiring empirical evidence that carefully applied radial symmetry can alleviate the challenges of information loss, marking a promising advance in equivariant network architectures.

To address this, we introduce KUMO, a generative evaluation framework designed specifically for assessing reasoning in LLMs. KUMO synergistically combines LLMs with symbolic engines to dynamically produce diverse, multi-turn reasoning tasks that are partially observable and adjustable in difficulty. Through an automated pipeline, KUMO continuously generates novel tasks across open-ended domains, compelling models to demonstrate genuine generalization rather than memorization. We evaluated 23 state-of-the-art LLMs on 5,000 tasks across 100 domains created by KUMO, benchmarking their reasoning abilities against university students. Our findings reveal that many LLMs have outperformed university-level performance on easy reasoning tasks, and reasoning-scaled LLMs reach university-level performance on complex reasoning challenges. Moreover, LLM performance on KUMO tasks correlates strongly with results on newly released real-world reasoning benchmarks, underscoring KUMO's value as a robust, enduring assessment tool for genuine LLM reasoning capabilities."}

However, scaling imitation learning for large robot foundation models remains challenging due to its reliance on high-quality expert demonstrations. Meanwhile, large amounts of video data depicting a wide range of environments and diverse behaviors are readily available. This data provides a rich source of information about real-world dynamics and agent-environment interactions. Leveraging this data directly for imitation learning, however, has proven difficult due to the lack of action annotation required for most contemporary methods. In this work, we present Unified World Models (UWM), a framework that allows for leveraging both video and action data for policy learning. Specifically, a UWM integrates an action diffusion process and a video diffusion process within a unified transformer architecture, where independent diffusion timesteps govern each modality. We show that by simply controlling each diffusion timestep, UWM can flexibly represent a policy, a forward dynamics, an inverse dynamics, and a video generator. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we show that: (1) UWM enables effective pretraining on large-scale multitask robot datasets with both dynamics and action predictions, resulting in more generalizable and robust policies than imitation learning, (2) UWM naturally facilitates learning from action-free video data through independent control of modality-specific diffusion timesteps, further improving the performance of finetuned policies. Our results suggest that UWM offers a promising step toward harnessing large, heterogeneous datasets for scalable robot learning, and provides a simple unification between the often disparate paradigms of imitation learning and world modeling.

As these AI systems become increasingly integrated into workflows, they offer unprecedented opportunities for augmenting human thinking while simultaneously risking cognitive erosion through passive consumption of generated answers. This tension is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks, where effective solutions require deep contextualization and integration of domain knowledge. Unlike structured tasks with established metrics, measuring the quality of human-LLM interaction in such open-ended tasks poses significant challenges due to the absence of ground truth and the iterative nature of solution development. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes interaction patterns along two dimensions: cognitive activity mode (exploration vs. exploitation) and cognitive engagement mode (constructive vs. detrimental). This framework provides systematic measurements to evaluate when LLMs are effective tools for thought rather than substitutes for human cognition, advancing theoretical understanding and practical guidance for developing AI systems that protect and augment human cognitive capabilities.'}

Domestic service robots with monitoring capabilities can enhance safety and provide essential support. Although image-based methods have advanced considerably in the past decade, their adoption remains limited by concerns over privacy and sensitivity to low-light or dark conditions. As an alternative, millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar can produce point cloud data which is privacy-preserving. However, processing the sparse and noisy point clouds remains a long-standing challenge. While graph-based methods and attention mechanisms show promise, they predominantly rely on "fixed" kernels; kernels that are applied uniformly across all neighbourhoods, highlighting the need for adaptive approaches that can dynamically adjust their kernels to the specific geometry of each local neighbourhood in point cloud data. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an adaptive approach within the graph convolutional framework. Instead of a single shared weight function, our Multi-Head Adaptive Kernel (MAK) module generates multiple dynamic kernels, each capturing different aspects of the local feature space. By progressively refining local features while maintaining global spatial context, our method enables convolution kernels to adapt to varying local features.

Here, we show that LLMs systematically reinforce the Matthew effect in citations by consistently favoring highly cited papers when generating references. This pattern persists across scientific domains despite significant field-specific variations in existence rates, which refer to the proportion of generated references that match existing records in external bibliometric databases. Analyzing 274,951 references generated by GPT-4o for 10,000 papers, we find that LLM recommendations diverge from traditional citation patterns by preferring more recent references with shorter titles and fewer authors. Emphasizing their content-level relevance, the generated references are semantically aligned with the content of each paper at levels comparable to the ground truth references and display similar network effects while reducing author self-citations.

Existing methods, which employ video generation models to synthesize novel views, suffer from limited video length and scene inconsistency, leading to artifacts and distortions during further reconstruction. To address this issue, we construct noisy samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and maintain scene consistency. However, for latent features with the perception field that spans both known and unknown regions, such latent-level momentum restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions. Therefore, we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner, we can iteratively recover a 3D scene, avoiding the limitation of video length.

To address this, we propose TaLoS which allows to build sparse task vectors with minimal interference without requiring explicit linearization and sharing information across tasks. We find that pre-trained models contain a subset of parameters with consistently low gradient sensitivity across tasks, and that sparsely updating only these parameters allows for promoting weight disentanglement during fine-tuning.

Specifically, we show that (a) a simple combination of the FSW embedding with an MLP achieves state-of-the-art performance in learning the (non-sliced) Wasserstein distance; and (b) replacing max-pooling with the FSW embedding makes PointNet significantly more robust to parameter reduction, with only minor performance degradation even after a 40-fold reduction.'}

FAICO presents key aspects of AI communication and their impacts on user experience to guide the design of effective AI communication. We then show actionable ways to translate our framework into two practical tools: design cards for designers and a configuration tool for users. The design cards enable designers to consider AI communication strategies that cater to a diverse range of users in co-creative contexts, while the configuration tool empowers users to customize AI communication based on their needs and creative workflows.

Furthermore, we present an approach for temporal action segmentation that tackles this challenge. Our approach leverages a shared representation at both the sequence and segment levels to reduce the impact of view differences during training. We achieve this by introducing a sequence loss and an action loss, which together facilitate consistent video and action representations across different views.

Given that the information such as the position and geometric characteristics of obstacles is random, the control parameters of the robot, such as velocity and angular velocity, are also prone to random deviations. To address this issue in the framework of the Industrial Internet Robot Collaboration System, this paper proposes a global path control scheme for mobile robots based on deep learning. First of all, the dynamic equation of the mobile robot is established. According to the linear velocity and angular velocity of the mobile robot, its motion behaviors are divided into obstacle - avoidance behavior, target - turning behavior, and target approaching behavior. Subsequently, the neural network method in deep learning is used to build a global path planning model for the robot. On this basis, a fuzzy controller is designed with the help of a fuzzy control algorithm to correct the deviations that occur during path planning, thereby achieving optimized control of the robot's global path. In addition, considering edge computing optimization, the proposed model can process local data at the edge device, reducing the communication burden between the robot and the central server, and improving the real time performance of path planning. The experimental results show that for the mobile robot controlled by the research method in this paper, the deviation distance of the path angle is within 5 cm, the deviation convergence can be completed within 10 ms, and the planned path is shorter. This indicates that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the global path planning ability of mobile robots in the industrial Internet environment and promote the collaborative operation of robots through edge computing optimization."}

Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud.

Despite its simplicity, LiDAR captures only the near side of objects, making center-based detectors prone to poor localization accuracy in cross-domain tasks with varying point distributions. Meanwhile, existing evaluation metrics designed for single-domain assessment also suffer from overfitting due to dataset-specific size variations. A key question arises: Do we really need models to maintain excellent performance in the entire 3D bounding boxes after being applied across domains? Actually, one of our main focuses is on preventing collisions between vehicles and other obstacles, especially in cross-domain scenarios where correctly predicting the sizes is much more difficult. To address these issues, we rethink cross-domain 3D object detection from a practical perspective. We propose two new metrics that evaluate a model's ability to detect objects' closer-surfaces to the LiDAR sensor. Additionally, we introduce EdgeHead, a refinement head that guides models to focus more on learnable closer surfaces, significantly improving cross-domain performance under both our new and traditional BEV/3D metrics. Furthermore, we argue that predicting the nearest corner rather than the object center enhances robustness. We propose a novel 3D object detector, coined as CornerPoint3D, which is built upon CenterPoint and uses heatmaps to supervise the learning and detection of the nearest corner of each object. Our proposed methods realize a balanced trade-off between the detection quality of entire bounding boxes and the locating accuracy of closer surfaces to the LiDAR sensor, outperforming the traditional center-based detector CenterPoint in multiple cross-domain tasks and providing a more practically reasonable and robust cross-domain 3D object detection solution."}

In this paper, we argue for the reification of fairness not only as a property of ADM, but also as an epistemic right of an individual to acquire information about the decisions that affect them and use that information to contest and seek effective redress against those decisions, in case they are proven to be discriminatory. We examine key concepts from existing research not only in algorithmic fairness but also in explainable artificial intelligence, accountability, and contestability. Integrating notions from these domains, we propose a conceptual framework to ascertain fairness by combining different tools that empower the end-users of ADM systems. Our framework shifts the focus from technical solutions aimed at practitioners to mechanisms that enable individuals to understand, challenge, and verify the fairness of decisions, and also serves as a blueprint for organizations and policymakers, bridging the gap between technical requirements and practical, user-centered accountability.'}

Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate the negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to employ collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the malicious collaborative knowledge from the user's historical interactions inserted by attackers. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand insufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework (RETURN) by retrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles and enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to identify potential perturbations within the users' historical sequences by retrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we further retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by using either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble recommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions.

Building on the Poisson cognitive hierarchy theory, this paper also presents a novel driving scenario generation method. The method controls the proportion of vehicles with different driving styles in the scenario using Poisson and binomial distributions, thus generating controllable and diverse driving environments.

Existing token pruning and feature merging methods often sacrifice critical temporal dependencies or dilute semantic information. We introduce differential distillation, a principled approach that systematically preserves task-relevant information while suppressing redundancy. Based on this principle, we develop ViLaMP, a hierarchical video-language model that processes hour-long videos at ``mixed precision'' through two key mechanisms: (1) differential keyframe selection that maximizes query relevance while maintaining temporal distinctiveness at the frame level and (2) differential feature merging that preserves query-salient features in non-keyframes at the patch level. Hence, ViLaMP retains full information in keyframes while reducing non-keyframes to their most salient features, resembling mixed-precision training. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViLaMP's superior performance across four video understanding benchmarks, particularly on long-form content. Notably, ViLaMP can process ultra-long videos (up to 10K frames) on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, achieving substantial computational efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance."}

Therefore, this paper proposes a reasoning method for intra-type and inter-type message passing based on static relationships. This method constructs a dual graph for intra-type message passing reasoning and builds a heterogeneous graph based on static relationships for inter-type message passing reasoning. The intra-type message passing reasoning model captures the neighborhood information of targets and relationships related to the question in the dual graph, updating the dual graph to obtain intra-type clues for answering the question. The inter-type message passing reasoning model captures the neighborhood information of targets and relationships from different categories related to the question in the heterogeneous graph, updating the heterogeneous graph to obtain inter-type clues for answering the question.

However, it has limitations, particularly in the third trimester, where the complexity of the fetal brain requires high image quality for extracting quantitative data. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers superior image quality and tissue differentiation but is less available, expensive, and requires time-consuming acquisition. Thus, transforming ultrasonic images into an MRI-mimicking display may be advantageous and allow better tissue anatomy presentation. To address this goal, we have examined the use of artificial intelligence, implementing a diffusion model renowned for generating high-quality images. The proposed method, termed "Dual Diffusion Imposed Correlation" (DDIC), leverages a diffusion-based translation methodology, assuming a shared latent space between ultrasound and MRI domains. Model training was obtained utilizing the "HC18" dataset for ultrasound and the "CRL fetal brain atlas" along with the "FeTA " datasets for MRI. The generated pseudo-MRI images provide notable improvements in visual discrimination of brain tissue, especially in the lateral ventricles and the Sylvian fissure, characterized by enhanced contrast clarity. Improvement was demonstrated in Mutual information, Peak signal-to-noise ratio, Fréchet Inception Distance, and Contrast-to-noise ratio. Findings from these evaluations indicate statistically significant superior performance of the DDIC compared to other translation methodologies.

So we hypothesize that mBART is inherently good at text-to-gloss tasks. To find support against this hypothesis, we trained mBART-50 on PHOENIX-14T benchmark and evaluated it with existing literature. Our mBART-50 finetune demonstrated State-of-the-Art performance on PHOENIX-14T benchmark, far outperforming existing models in all 6 metrics (ScareBLEU = 63.89, BLEU-1 = 55.14, BLEU-2 = 38.07, BLEU-3 = 27.13, BLEU-4 = 20.68, COMET = 0.624). Based on the results, this study proposes a new paradigm for text-to-gloss task using mBART models. Additionally, our results show that BdSL text-to-gloss task can greatly benefit from rule-based synthetic dataset.'}

However, most existing hybrid frameworks rely on explicit recurrent formulations, which suffer from numerical instability and error accumulation during long-horizon forecasting. In this work, we introduce Im-PiNDiff, a novel implicit physics-integrated neural differentiable solver for stable and accurate modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics. Inspired by deep equilibrium models, Im-PiNDiff advances the state using implicit fixed-point layers, enabling robust long-term simulation while remaining fully end-to-end differentiable. To enable scalable training, we introduce a hybrid gradient propagation strategy that integrates adjoint-state methods with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. This approach eliminates the need to store intermediate solver states and decouples memory complexity from the number of solver iterations, significantly reducing training overhead. We further incorporate checkpointing techniques to manage memory in long-horizon rollouts. Numerical experiments on various spatiotemporal PDE systems, including advection-diffusion processes, Burgers' dynamics, and multi-physics chemical vapor infiltration processes, demonstrate that Im-PiNDiff achieves superior predictive performance, enhanced numerical stability, and substantial reductions in memory and runtime cost relative to explicit and naive implicit baselines.

Existing fault tolerance methods protect each operation separately using decoupled kernels, incurring substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we propose a novel error-resilient framework for Transformer models, integrating end-to-end fault tolerant attention (EFTA) to improve inference reliability against soft errors. Our approach enables error detection and correction within a fully fused attention kernel, reducing redundant data access and thereby mitigating memory faults. To further enhance error coverage and reduce overhead, we design a hybrid fault tolerance scheme tailored for the EFTA, introducing for the first time: 1) architecture-aware algorithm-based fault tolerance (ABFT) using tensor checksum, which minimizes inter-thread communication overhead on tensor cores during error detection; 2) selective neuron value restriction, which selectively applies adaptive fault tolerance constraints to neuron values, balancing error coverage and overhead; 3) unified verification, reusing checksums to streamline multiple computation steps into a single verification process.

In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning (MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning granularities-including channels, query, key, heads, embeddings, and blocks. MDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture latency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance between latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned structure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints. This versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDP significantly outperforms previous methods, especially at high pruning ratios. On ImageNet, MDP achieves a 28% speed increase with a +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior work like HALP for ResNet50 pruning.

Participants engaged in a multi-prompt conversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat intent-based expectations with observed interactions. We found that: 1) Several aspects of pre-chat expectations are closely associated with users' prior experiences with ChatGPT, search engines, and virtual assistants; 2) Prior system experience shapes language use and prompting behavior. Frequent ChatGPT users reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts. Users with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational queries with minimal modifications. Users of virtual assistants favored directive, command-like prompts, reinforcing functional fixedness; 3) When the system failed to meet expectations, participants generated more detailed prompts with increased linguistic diversity, reflecting adaptive shifts.

As the size of these models increases, they achieve outstanding results. Given their widespread use, many explainability techniques are developed based on these models. However, this process becomes computationally expensive due to the large size of the models. Additionally, transformers interpret input information through tokens that fragment input words into sequences lacking inherent semantic meaning, complicating the explanation of the model from the very beginning. This study proposes a novel methodology to achieve explainability in natural language processing tasks by automatically converting sentences into graphs and maintaining semantics through nodes and relations that express fundamental linguistic concepts. It also allows the subsequent exploitation of this knowledge in subsequent tasks, making it possible to obtain trends and understand how the model associates the different elements inside the text with the explained task.

In contrast, identifying the $k$ most important features can already be sufficiently insightful and yields the potential to leverage algorithmic opportunities connected to the field of multi-armed bandits.

In this paper, we propose a drug-target association prediction model HCAF-DTA based on cross-attention fusion hypergraph neural network. The model innovatively introduces hypergraph representation in the feature extraction stage: drug molecule hypergraphs are constructed based on the tree decomposition algorithm, and the sub-structural and global features extracted by fusing the hypergraph neural network with the graphical neural network through hopping connections, in which the hyper edges can efficiently characterise the functional functional groups and other key chemical features; for the protein feature extraction, a weighted graph is constructed based on the residues predicted by the ESM model contact maps to construct weighted graphs, and multilayer graph neural networks were used to capture spatial dependencies. In the prediction stage, a bidirectional multi-head cross-attention mechanism is designed to model intermolecular interactions from the dual viewpoints of atoms and amino acids, and cross-modal features with correlated information are fused by attention. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as Davis and KIBA show that HCAF-DTA outperforms state of the arts in all three performance evaluation metrics, with the MSE metrics reaching 0.198 and 0.122, respectively, with an improvement of up to 4% from the optimal baseline.'}

In this work, we propose Random Conditioning, a novel approach that pairs noised images with randomly selected text conditions to enable efficient, image-free knowledge distillation. By leveraging this technique, we show that the student can generate concepts unseen in the training images. When applied to conditional diffusion model distillation, our method allows the student to explore the condition space without generating condition-specific images, resulting in notable improvements in both generation quality and efficiency.

However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss.

These additional requirements introduce complexities that existing code-generation benchmarks often fail to capture, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs for RTL generation. To address this gap, we propose TuRTLe, a unified evaluation framework designed to systematically assess LLMs across key RTL generation tasks. TuRTLe integrates multiple existing benchmarks and automates the evaluation process, enabling a comprehensive assessment of LLM performance in syntax correctness, functional correctness, synthesis, PPA optimization, and exact line completion. Using this framework, we benchmark a diverse set of open LLMs and analyze their strengths and weaknesses in EDA-specific tasks. Our results show that reasoning-based models, such as DeepSeek R1, consistently outperform others across multiple evaluation criteria, but at the cost of increased computational overhead and inference latency.

Addressing these limitations, this paper introduces a novel AGV path planning approach for 3D warehouse environments that leverages a hybrid framework combining ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) with deep learning models, called NAHACO (Neural Adaptive Heuristic Ant Colony Optimization). NAHACO integrates three key innovations: first, an innovative heuristic algorithm for 3D warehouse cargo modeling using multidimensional tensors, which addresses the challenge of achieving superior heuristic accuracy; second, integration of a congestion-aware loss function within the ACO framework to adjust path costs based on traffic and capacity constraints, called CARL (Congestion-Aware Reinforce Loss), enabling dynamic heuristic calibration for optimizing ACO-based path planning; and third, an adaptive attention mechanism that captures multi-scale spatial features, thereby addressing dynamic heuristic calibration for further optimization of ACO-based path planning and AGV navigation. NAHACO significantly boosts path planning efficiency, yielding faster computation times and superior performance over both vanilla and state-of-the-art methods, while automatically adapting to warehouse constraints for real-time optimization. NAHACO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, lowering the total cost by up to 24.7% on TSP benchmarks.

Though it is difficult to evaluate the best course of action without knowing the unknown, the unknown can often be understood through models, maps, or common sense. However, previous work has shown that improving estimates of information gain through such prior knowledge leads to greedy behavior and ultimately causes backtracking, which degrades coverage performance. In fact, any information gain maximization will exhibit this behavior, even without prior knowledge. Information gained at task completion is constant, and cannot be maximized for. It is therefore an unsuitable choice as an optimization objective. Instead, information gain is a decision criterion for determining which candidate states should still be considered for exploration. The task therefore becomes to reach completion with the shortest total path. Since determining the shortest path is typically intractable, it is necessary to rely on a heuristic or estimate to identify candidate states that minimize the total path length. To address this, we propose a heuristic that reduces backtracking by preferring candidate states that are close to the robot, but far away from other candidate states. We evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic in simulation against an information gain-based approach and frontier exploration, and show that our method significantly decreases total path length, both with and without prior knowledge of the environment.'}
