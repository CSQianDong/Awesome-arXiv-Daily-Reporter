# A Representationalist, Functionalist and Naturalistic Conception of Intelligence as a Foundation for AGI 

**Authors**: Rolf Pfister  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07600)  

**Abstract**: The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the ability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously unknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such as deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as abstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are applied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are obtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but only correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and contingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is functionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the desired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by attributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This representational and functional conception of intelligence enables a naturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as intentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of intelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can gain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited by the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.

# Queueing, Predictions, and LLMs: Challenges and Open Problems 

**Authors**: Michael Mitzenmacher, Rana Shahout  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07545)  

**Abstract**: Queueing systems present many opportunities for applying machine-learning predictions, such as estimated service times, to improve system performance. This integration raises numerous open questions about how predictions can be effectively leveraged to improve scheduling decisions. Recent studies explore queues with predicted service times, typically aiming to minimize job time in the system. We review these works, highlight the effectiveness of predictions, and present open questions on queue performance. We then move to consider an important practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large Language Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and highlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular, we consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems are inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory footprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and multiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We provide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and introduce new models and open problems that arise from them. We argue that there are significant opportunities for applying insights and analysis from queueing theory to scheduling in LLM systems.

**Authors**: Maurice Ongala, Ruth Kiraka, Jyoti Choundrie, Javan Okello  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07540)  

**Abstract**: This protocol outlines a scoping review designed to systematically map the existing body of evidence on AI-enabled knowledge sharing in resource-limited non-profit healthcare organizations. The review aims to investigate how such technologies enhance collaboration and decision-making, particularly in the context of reduced external support following the cessation of USAID operations. Guided by three theoretical frameworks namely, the Resource-Based View, Dynamic Capabilities Theory, and Absorptive Capacity Theory, this study will explore the dual role of AI as a strategic resource and an enabler of organizational learning and agility. The protocol details a rigorous methodological approach based on PRISMA-ScR guidelines, encompassing a systematic search strategy across multiple databases, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and a structured data extraction process. By integrating theoretical insights with empirical evidence, this scoping review seeks to identify critical gaps in the literature and inform the design of effective, resource-optimized AI solutions in non-profit healthcare settings.

# From Text to Visuals: Using LLMs to Generate Math Diagrams with Vector Graphics 

**Authors**: Jaewook Lee, Jeongah Lee, Wanyong Feng, Andrew Lan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07429)  

**Abstract**: Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new possibilities for enhancing math education by automating support for both teachers and students. While prior work has focused on generating math problems and high-quality distractors, the role of visualization in math learning remains under-explored. Diagrams are essential for mathematical thinking and problem-solving, yet manually creating them is time-consuming and requires domain-specific expertise, limiting scalability. Recent research on using LLMs to generate Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating diagram creation. Unlike pixel-based images, SVGs represent geometric figures using XML, allowing seamless scaling and adaptability. Educational platforms such as Khan Academy and IXL already use SVGs to display math problems and hints. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related diagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We address three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math diagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG is an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what prompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate SVG-based diagrams. Our contributions include defining the task of automatically generating SVG-based diagrams for math hints, developing an LLM prompting-based pipeline, and identifying key strategies for improving diagram generation. Additionally, we introduce a Visual Question Answering-based evaluation setup and conduct ablation studies to assess different pipeline variations. By automating the math diagram creation, we aim to provide students and teachers with accurate, conceptually relevant visual aids that enhance problem-solving and learning experiences.

# Encoding Argumentation Frameworks to Propositional Logic Systems 

**Authors**: Shuai Tang, Jiachao Wu, Ning Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07351)  

**Abstract**: The theory of argumentation frameworks ($AF$s) has been a useful tool for artificial intelligence. The research of the connection between $AF$s and logic is an important branch. This paper generalizes the encoding method by encoding $AF$s as logical formulas in different propositional logic systems. It studies the relationship between models of an AF by argumentation semantics, including Dung's classical semantics and Gabbay's equational semantics, and models of the encoded formulas by semantics of propositional logic systems. Firstly, we supplement the proof of the regular encoding function in the case of encoding $AF$s to the 2-valued propositional logic system. Then we encode $AF$s to 3-valued propositional logic systems and fuzzy propositional logic systems and explore the model relationship. This paper enhances the connection between $AF$s and propositional logic systems. It also provides a new way to construct new equational semantics by choosing different fuzzy logic operations.

# Human Machine Co-Adaptation Model and Its Convergence Analysis 

**Authors**: Steven W. Su, Yaqi Li, Kairui Guo, Rob Duffield  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07319)  

**Abstract**: The key to robot-assisted rehabilitation lies in the design of the human-machine interface, which must accommodate the needs of both patients and machines. Current interface designs primarily focus on machine control algorithms, often requiring patients to spend considerable time adapting. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the Cooperative Adaptive Markov Decision Process (CAMDPs) model to address the fundamental aspects of the interactive learning process, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance. We establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of CAMDPs and ensure the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium points. Leveraging these conditions, we guarantee the system's convergence to a unique Nash equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore scenarios with multiple Nash equilibrium points, devising strategies to adjust both Value Evaluation and Policy Improvement algorithms to enhance the likelihood of converging to the global minimal Nash equilibrium point. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions and algorithms, demonstrating their applicability and robustness in practical settings. The proposed conditions for convergence and the identification of a unique optimal Nash equilibrium contribute to the development of more effective adaptive systems for human users in robot-assisted rehabilitation.

# Automatic Curriculum Design for Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination 

**Authors**: Won-Sang You, Tae-Gwan Ha, Seo-Young Lee, Kyung-Joong Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07275)  

**Abstract**: Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate with humans without using human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen environments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should consider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination ability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these challenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in competitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends the multi-agent UED approach to a zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a utility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination setting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more effectively than the previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI coordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using human proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline models and achieves a high human-AI coordination performance in unseen environments.

# A Zero-shot Learning Method Based on Large Language Models for Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Embedding 

**Authors**: Bingchen Liu, Jingchen Li, Naixing Xu, Xin Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07202)  

**Abstract**: Zero-shot learning (ZL) is crucial for tasks involving unseen categories, such as natural language processing, image classification, and cross-lingual transfer. Current applications often fail to accurately infer and handle new relations or entities involving unseen categories, severely limiting their scalability and practicality in open-domain scenarios. ZL learning faces the challenge of effectively transferring semantic information of unseen categories in multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) embedding representation learning. In this paper, we propose ZSLLM, a framework for zero-shot embedding learning of MMKGs using large language models (LLMs). We leverage textual modality information of unseen categories as prompts to fully utilize the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, enabling semantic information transfer across different modalities for unseen categories. Through model-based learning, the embedding representation of unseen categories in MMKG is enhanced. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

# Lawful and Accountable Personal Data Processing with GDPR-based Access and Usage Control in Distributed Systems 

**Authors**: L. Thomas van Binsbergen, Marten C. Steketee, Milen G. Kebede, Heleen L. Janssen, Tom M. van Engers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07172)  

**Abstract**: Compliance with the GDPR privacy regulation places a significant burden on organisations regarding the handling of personal data. The perceived efforts and risks of complying with the GDPR further increase when data processing activities span across organisational boundaries, as is the case in both small-scale data sharing settings and in large-scale international data spaces.
This paper addresses these concerns by proposing a case-generic method for automated normative reasoning that establishes legal arguments for the lawfulness of data processing activities. The arguments are established on the basis of case-specific legal qualifications made by privacy experts, bringing the human in the loop. The obtained expert system promotes transparency and accountability, remains adaptable to extended or altered interpretations of the GDPR, and integrates into novel or existing distributed data processing systems.
This result is achieved by defining a formal ontology and semantics for automated normative reasoning based on an analysis of the purpose-limitation principle of the GDPR. The ontology and semantics are implemented in eFLINT, a domain-specific language for specifying and reasoning with norms. The XACML architecture standard, applicable to both access and usage control, is extended, demonstrating how GDPR-based normative reasoning can integrate into (existing, distributed) systems for data processing. The resulting system is designed and critically assessed in reference to requirements extracted from the GPDR.

**Authors**: Longchao Da, Tiejin Chen, Zhuoheng Li, Shreyas Bachiraju, Huaiyuan Yao, Xiyang Hu, Zhengzhong Tu, Yue Zhao, Dongjie Wang, Xuanyu, Zhou, Ram Pendyala, Benjamin Stabler, Yezhou Yang, Xuesong Zhou, Hua Wei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07158)  

**Abstract**: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) into transportation planning has the potential to revolutionize tasks such as demand forecasting, infrastructure design, policy evaluation, and traffic simulation. However, there is a critical need for a systematic framework to guide the adoption of GenAI in this interdisciplinary domain. In this survey, we, a multidisciplinary team of researchers spanning computer science and transportation engineering, present the first comprehensive framework for leveraging GenAI in transportation planning. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes existing applications and methodologies into two perspectives: transportation planning tasks and computational techniques. From the transportation planning perspective, we examine the role of GenAI in automating descriptive, predictive, generative, simulation, and explainable tasks to enhance mobility systems. From the computational perspective, we detail advancements in data preparation, domain-specific fine-tuning, and inference strategies, such as retrieval-augmented generation and zero-shot learning tailored to transportation applications. Additionally, we address critical challenges, including data scarcity, explainability, bias mitigation, and the development of domain-specific evaluation frameworks that align with transportation goals like sustainability, equity, and system efficiency. This survey aims to bridge the gap between traditional transportation planning methodologies and modern AI techniques, fostering collaboration and innovation. By addressing these challenges and opportunities, we seek to inspire future research that ensures ethical, equitable, and impactful use of generative AI in transportation planning.

# Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer 

**Authors**: Ali Baheri, Cecilia O. Alm  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07148)  

**Abstract**: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.

# Correctness Learning: Deductive Verification Guided Learning for Human-AI Collaboration 

**Authors**: Zhao Jin, Lu Jin, Yizhe Luo, Shuo Feng, Yucheng Shi, Kai Zheng, Xinde Yu, Mingliang Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07096)  

**Abstract**: Despite significant progress in AI and decision-making technologies in safety-critical fields, challenges remain in verifying the correctness of decision output schemes and verification-result driven design. We propose correctness learning (CL) to enhance human-AI collaboration integrating deductive verification methods and insights from historical high-quality schemes. The typical pattern hidden in historical high-quality schemes, such as change of task priorities in shared resources, provides critical guidance for intelligent agents in learning and decision-making. By utilizing deductive verification methods, we proposed patten-driven correctness learning (PDCL), formally modeling and reasoning the adaptive behaviors-or 'correctness pattern'-of system agents based on historical high-quality schemes, capturing the logical relationships embedded within these schemes. Using this logical information as guidance, we establish a correctness judgment and feedback mechanism to steer the intelligent decision model toward the 'correctness pattern' reflected in historical high-quality schemes. Extensive experiments across multiple working conditions and core parameters validate the framework's components and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving decision-making and resource optimization.

# Rule-Based Conflict-Free Decision Framework in Swarm Confrontation 

**Authors**: Zhaoqi Dong, Zhinan Wang, Quanqi Zheng, Bin Xu, Lei Chen, Jinhu Lv  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07077)  

**Abstract**: Traditional rule--based decision--making methods with interpretable advantage, such as finite state machine, suffer from the jitter or deadlock(JoD) problems in extremely dynamic scenarios. To realize agent swarm confrontation, decision conflicts causing many JoD problems are a key issue to be solved. Here, we propose a novel decision--making framework that integrates probabilistic finite state machine, deep convolutional networks, and reinforcement learning to implement interpretable intelligence into agents. Our framework overcomes state machine instability and JoD problems, ensuring reliable and adaptable decisions in swarm confrontation. The proposed approach demonstrates effective performance via enhanced human--like cooperation and competitive strategies in the rigorous evaluation of real experiments, outperforming other methods.

# ReAgent: Reversible Multi-Agent Reasoning for Knowledge-Enhanced Multi-Hop QA 

**Authors**: Zhao Xinjie, Fan Gao, Rui Yang, Yingjian Chen, Yuyang Wang, Ying Zhu, Jiacheng Tang, Irene Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06951)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved multi-hop question answering (QA) through direct Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the irreversible nature of CoT leads to error accumulation, making it challenging to correct mistakes in multi-hop reasoning. This paper introduces ReAgent: a Reversible multi-Agent collaborative framework augmented with explicit backtracking mechanisms, enabling reversible multi-hop reasoning. By incorporating text-based retrieval, information aggregation and validation, our system can detect and correct errors mid-reasoning, leading to more robust and interpretable QA outcomes. The framework and experiments serve as a foundation for future work on error-tolerant QA systems. Empirical evaluations across three benchmarks indicate ReAgent's efficacy, yielding average about 6\% improvements against baseline models.

# Enhancing Time Series Forecasting via Logic-Inspired Regularization 

**Authors**: Jianqi Zhang, Jingyao Wang, Xingchen Shen, Wenwen Qiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06867)  

**Abstract**: Time series forecasting (TSF) plays a crucial role in many applications. Transformer-based methods are one of the mainstream techniques for TSF. Existing methods treat all token dependencies equally. However, we find that the effectiveness of token dependencies varies across different forecasting scenarios, and existing methods ignore these differences, which affects their performance. This raises two issues: (1) What are effective token dependencies? (2) How can we learn effective dependencies? From a logical perspective, we align Transformer-based TSF methods with the logical framework and define effective token dependencies as those that ensure the tokens as atomic formulas (Issue 1). We then align the learning process of Transformer methods with the process of obtaining atomic formulas in logic, which inspires us to design a method for learning these effective dependencies (Issue 2). Specifically, we propose Attention Logic Regularization (Attn-L-Reg), a plug-and-play method that guides the model to use fewer but more effective dependencies by making the attention map sparse, thereby ensuring the tokens as atomic formulas and improving prediction performance. Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis confirm the effectiveness of Attn-L-Reg.

# Dubito Ergo Sum: Exploring AI Ethics 

**Authors**: Viktor Dorfler, Giles Cuthbert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06788)  

**Abstract**: We paraphrase Descartes' famous dictum in the area of AI ethics where the "I doubt and therefore I am" is suggested as a necessary aspect of morality. Therefore AI, which cannot doubt itself, cannot possess moral agency. Of course, this is not the end of the story. We explore various aspects of the human mind that substantially differ from AI, which includes the sensory grounding of our knowing, the act of understanding, and the significance of being able to doubt ourselves. The foundation of our argument is the discipline of ethics, one of the oldest and largest knowledge projects of human history, yet, we seem only to be beginning to get a grasp of it. After a couple of thousand years of studying the ethics of humans, we (humans) arrived at a point where moral psychology suggests that our moral decisions are intuitive, and all the models from ethics become relevant only when we explain ourselves. This recognition has a major impact on what and how we can do regarding AI ethics. We do not offer a solution, we explore some ideas and leave the problem open, but we hope somewhat better understood than before our study.

# Beyond Black-Box Benchmarking: Observability, Analytics, and Optimization of Agentic Systems 

**Authors**: Dany Moshkovich, Hadar Mulian, Sergey Zeltyn, Natti Eder, Inna Skarbovsky, Roy Abitbol  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06745)  

**Abstract**: The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional "black box" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.

# Agent models: Internalizing Chain-of-Action Generation into Reasoning models 

**Authors**: Yuxiang Zhang, Yuqi Yang, Jiangming Shu, Xinyan Wen, Jitao Sang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06580)  

**Abstract**: Traditional agentic workflows rely on external prompts to manage interactions with tools and the environment, which limits the autonomy of reasoning models. We position \emph{Large Agent Models (LAMs)} that internalize the generation of \emph{Chain-of-Action (CoA)}, enabling the model to autonomously decide when and how to use external tools. Our proposed AutoCoA framework combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL), allowing the model to seamlessly switch between reasoning and action while efficiently managing environment interactions. Main components include step-level action triggering, trajectory-level CoA optimization, and an internal world model to reduce real-environment interaction costs. Evaluations on open-domain QA tasks demonstrate that AutoCoA-trained agent models significantly outperform ReAct-based workflows in task completion, especially in tasks that require long-term reasoning and multi-step actions. Code and dataset are available at this https URL

# ProJudge: A Multi-Modal Multi-Discipline Benchmark and Instruction-Tuning Dataset for MLLM-based Process Judges 

**Authors**: Jiaxin Ai, Pengfei Zhou, Zhaopan Xu, Ming Li, Fanrui Zhang, Zizhen Li, Jianwen Sun, Yukang Feng, Baojin Huang, Zhongyuan Wang, Kaipeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06553)  

**Abstract**: As multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit errors when solving scientific problems, evaluating the validity of their reasoning processes is critical for ensuring reliability and uncovering fine-grained model weaknesses. Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice. However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain. To address this, we introduce ProJudgeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges. ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors. Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we further propose ProJudge-173k, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a Dynamic Dual-Phase fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models. All the resources will be released to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation.

# ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test: A Critical Analysis 

**Authors**: Marco Giunti  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06551)  

**Abstract**: This paper critically examines the recent publication "ChatGPT-4 in the Turing Test" by Restrepo Echavarría (2025), challenging its central claims regarding the absence of minimally serious test implementations and the conclusion that ChatGPT-4 fails the Turing Test. The analysis reveals that the criticisms based on rigid criteria and limited experimental data are not fully justified. More importantly, the paper makes several constructive contributions that enrich our understanding of Turing Test implementations. It demonstrates that two distinct formats--the three-player and two-player tests--are both valid, each with unique methodological implications. The work distinguishes between absolute criteria (reflecting an optimal 50% identification rate in a three-player format) and relative criteria (which measure how closely a machine's performance approximates that of a human), offering a more nuanced evaluation framework. Furthermore, the paper clarifies the probabilistic underpinnings of both test types by modeling them as Bernoulli experiments--correlated in the three-player version and uncorrelated in the two-player version. This formalization allows for a rigorous separation between the theoretical criteria for passing the test, defined in probabilistic terms, and the experimental data that require robust statistical methods for proper interpretation. In doing so, the paper not only refutes key aspects of the criticized study but also lays a solid foundation for future research on objective measures of how closely an AI's behavior aligns with, or deviates from, that of a human being.

# ExKG-LLM: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Expansion of Cognitive Neuroscience Knowledge Graphs 

**Authors**: Ali Sarabadani, Kheirolah Rahsepar Fard, Hamid Dalvand  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06479)  

**Abstract**: The paper introduces ExKG-LLM, a framework designed to automate the expansion of cognitive neuroscience knowledge graphs (CNKG) using large language models (LLMs). It addresses limitations in existing tools by enhancing accuracy, completeness, and usefulness in CNKG. The framework leverages a large dataset of scientific papers and clinical reports, applying state-of-the-art LLMs to extract, optimize, and integrate new entities and relationships. Evaluation metrics include precision, recall, and graph density. Results show significant improvements: precision (0.80, +6.67%), recall (0.81, +15.71%), F1 score (0.805, +11.81%), and increased edge nodes (21.13% and 31.92%). Graph density slightly decreased, reflecting a broader but more fragmented structure. Engagement rates rose by 20%, while CNKG diameter increased to 15, indicating a more distributed structure. Time complexity improved to O(n log n), but space complexity rose to O(n2), indicating higher memory usage. ExKG-LLM demonstrates potential for enhancing knowledge generation, semantic search, and clinical decision-making in cognitive neuroscience, adaptable to broader scientific fields.

# SKG-LLM: Developing a Mathematical Model for Stroke Knowledge Graph Construction Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Ali Sarabadani, Kheirolah Rahsepar Fard, Hamid Dalvand  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06475)  

**Abstract**: The purpose of this study is to introduce SKG-LLM. A knowledge graph (KG) is constructed from stroke-related articles using mathematical and large language models (LLMs). SKG-LLM extracts and organizes complex relationships from the biomedical literature, using it to increase the accuracy and depth of KG in stroke research. In the proposed method, GPT-4 was used for data pre-processing, and the extraction of embeddings was also done by GPT-4 in the whole KG construction process. The performance of the proposed model was tested with two evaluation criteria: Precision and Recall. For further validation of the proposed model, GPT-4 was used. Compared with Wikidata and WN18RR, the proposed KG-LLM approach performs better, especially in precision and recall. By including GPT-4 in the preprocessing process, the SKG-LLM model achieved a precision score of 0.906 and a recall score of 0.923. Expert reviews further improved the results and increased precision to 0.923 and recall to 0.918. The knowledge graph constructed by SKG-LLM contains 2692 nodes and 5012 edges, which are 13 distinct types of nodes and 24 types of edges.

# Think Twice, Click Once: Enhancing GUI Grounding via Fast and Slow Systems 

**Authors**: Fei Tang, Yongliang Shen, Hang Zhang, Siqi Chen, Guiyang Hou, Wenqi Zhang, Wenqiao Zhang, Kaitao Song, Weiming Lu, Yueting Zhuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06470)  

**Abstract**: Humans can flexibly switch between different modes of thinking based on task complexity: from rapid intuitive judgments to in-depth analytical understanding. However, current Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding systems which locate interface elements based on natural language instructions rely solely on immediate prediction without reasoning, struggling to understand complex interface layouts with nested structures and hierarchical relationships, limiting their effectiveness on complex interfaces. Inspired by human dual-system cognition, we present Focus, a novel GUI grounding framework that combines fast prediction with systematic analysis. The framework dynamically switches between rapid and deliberate processing through an adaptive system switching based on task complexity, optimizing both efficiency and accuracy. Focus decomposes grounding into progressive stages: interface summarization, visual focused analysis, and precise coordinate prediction. This structured decomposition enables systematic understanding of both interface layouts and visual relationships. Extensive experiments show that Focus achieves state-of-the-art performance using only 300K of the training data with a 2B parameter model compared to existing approaches. Focus demonstrates superior performance particularly in complex GUI scenarios, achieving 77.4% average accuracy on ScreenSpot and 13.3% on the more challenging ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals the effectiveness of this dual-system approach while demonstrating its potential for improving complex GUI interaction scenarios.

# Explaining Control Policies through Predicate Decision Diagrams 

**Authors**: Debraj Chakraborty, Clemens Dubslaff, Sudeep Kanav, Jan Kretinsky, Christoph Weinhuber  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06420)  

**Abstract**: Safety-critical controllers of complex systems are hard to construct manually. Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.

**Abstract**: Despite the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation agents, there has been limited integration of computer science research and established negotiation theory to develop new theories of AI negotiation. To bridge this gap, we conducted an International AI Negotiations Competition in which participants iteratively designed and refined prompts for large language model (LLM) negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 120,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that fundamental principles from established human-human negotiation theory remain crucial in AI-AI negotiations. Specifically, agents exhibiting high warmth fostered higher counterpart subjective value and reached deals more frequently, which enabled them to create and claim more value in integrative settings. However, conditional on reaching a deal, warm agents claimed less value while dominant agents claimed more value. These results align with classic negotiation theory emphasizing relationship-building, assertiveness, and preparation. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by negotiation theory, particularly regarding the effectiveness of AI-specific strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. The agent that won our competition implemented an approach that blended traditional negotiation preparation frameworks with AI-specific methods. Together, these results suggest the importance of establishing a new theory of AI negotiations that integrates established negotiation theory with AI-specific strategies to optimize agent performance. Our research suggests this new theory must account for the unique characteristics of autonomous agents and establish the conditions under which traditional negotiation theory applies in automated settings.

**Authors**: Alex Casella, Wayne Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06410)  

**Abstract**: The rise of Agentic applications and automation in the Voice AI industry has led to an increased reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) to navigate graph-based logic workflows composed of nodes and edges. However, existing methods face challenges such as alignment errors in complex workflows and hallucinations caused by excessive context size. To address these limitations, we introduce the Performant Agentic Framework (PAF), a novel system that assists LLMs in selecting appropriate nodes and executing actions in order when traversing complex graphs. PAF combines LLM-based reasoning with a mathematically grounded vector scoring mechanism, achieving both higher accuracy and reduced latency. Our approach dynamically balances strict adherence to predefined paths with flexible node jumps to handle various user inputs efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that PAF significantly outperforms baseline methods, paving the way for scalable, real-time Conversational AI systems in complex business environments.

# Optimizing Minimum Vertex Cover Solving via a GCN-assisted Heuristic Algorithm 

**Authors**: Enqiang Zhu, Qiqi Bao, Yu Zhang, Chanjuan Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06396)  

**Abstract**: The problem of finding a minimum vertex cover (MVC) in a graph is a well-known NP-hard problem with significant practical applications in optimization and scheduling. Its complexity, combined with the increasing scale of problems, underscores the need for efficient and effective algorithms. However, existing heuristic algorithms for MVC often rely on simplistic initialization strategies and overlook the impact of edge attributes and neighborhood information on vertex selection. In this paper, we introduce GCNIVC, a novel heuristic search algorithm designed to address the limitations of existing methods for solving MVC problems in large-scale graphs. Our approach features two main innovations. First, it utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture the global structure of graphs, which enables the generation of high-quality initial solutions that enhance the efficiency of the subsequent search process. Second, GCNIVC introduces a new heuristic that employs three containers and the concept of double-covered edges (dc-edges), improving search efficiency and providing greater flexibility for adding and removing operations based on edge attributes. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that GCNIVC outperforms state-of-the-art MVC algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Our results highlight the effectiveness of GCNIVC's GCN-assisted initialization and its edge-informed search strategy. This study not only advances the understanding of MVC problem-solving but also contributes a new tool for addressing large-scale graph optimization challenges.

# Causal Discovery and Inference towards Urban Elements and Associated Factors 

**Authors**: Tao Feng, Yunke Zhang, Xiaochen Fan, Huandong Wang, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06395)  

**Abstract**: To uncover the city's fundamental functioning mechanisms, it is important to acquire a deep understanding of complicated relationships among citizens, location, and mobility behaviors. Previous research studies have applied direct correlation analysis to investigate such relationships. Nevertheless, due to the ubiquitous confounding effects, empirical correlation analysis may not accurately reflect underlying causal relationships among basic urban elements. In this paper, we propose a novel urban causal computing framework to comprehensively explore causalities and confounding effects among a variety of factors across different types of urban elements. In particular, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to discover the potential causal graph, which depicts the causal relations between urban factors. The causal graph further serves as the guidance for estimating causal effects between pair-wise urban factors by propensity score matching. After removing the confounding effects from correlations, we leverage significance levels of causal effects in downstream urban mobility prediction tasks. Experimental studies on open-source urban datasets show that the discovered causal graph demonstrates a hierarchical structure, where citizens affect locations, and they both cause changes in urban mobility behaviors. Experimental results in urban mobility prediction tasks further show that the proposed method can effectively reduce confounding effects and enhance performance of urban computing tasks.

**Abstract**: Ensuring safe and effective use of AI requires understanding and anticipating its performance on novel tasks, from advanced scientific challenges to transformed workplace activities. So far, benchmarking has guided progress in AI, but it has offered limited explanatory and predictive power for general-purpose AI systems, given the low transferability across diverse tasks. In this paper, we introduce general scales for AI evaluation that can explain what common AI benchmarks really measure, extract ability profiles of AI systems, and predict their performance for new task instances, in- and out-of-distribution. Our fully-automated methodology builds on 18 newly-crafted rubrics that place instance demands on general scales that do not saturate. Illustrated for 15 large language models and 63 tasks, high explanatory power is unleashed from inspecting the demand and ability profiles, bringing insights on the sensitivity and specificity exhibited by different benchmarks, and how knowledge, metacognition and reasoning are affected by model size, chain-of-thought and distillation. Surprisingly, high predictive power at the instance level becomes possible using these demand levels, providing superior estimates over black-box baseline predictors based on embeddings or finetuning, especially in out-of-distribution settings (new tasks and new benchmarks). The scales, rubrics, battery, techniques and results presented here represent a major step for AI evaluation, underpinning the reliable deployment of AI in the years ahead.

# Higher-Order Belief in Incomplete Information MAIDs 

**Authors**: Jack Foxabbott, Rohan Subramani, Francis Rhys Ward  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06323)  

**Abstract**: Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) are probabilistic graphical models which represent strategic interactions between agents. MAIDs are equivalent to extensive form games (EFGs) but have a more compact and informative structure. However, MAIDs cannot, in general, represent settings of incomplete information -- wherein agents have different beliefs about the game being played, and different beliefs about each-other's beliefs. In this paper, we introduce incomplete information MAIDs (II-MAIDs). We define both infinite and finite-depth II-MAIDs and prove an equivalence relation to EFGs with incomplete information and no common prior over types. We prove that II-MAIDs inherit classical equilibria concepts via this equivalence, but note that these solution concepts are often unrealistic in the setting with no common prior because they violate common knowledge of rationality. We define a more realistic solution concept based on recursive best-response. Throughout, we describe an example with a hypothetical AI agent undergoing evaluation to illustrate the applicability of II-MAIDs.

# LapSum -- One Method to Differentiate Them All: Ranking, Sorting and Top-k Selection 

**Authors**: Łukasz Struski, Michał B. Bednarczyk, Igor T. Podolak, Jacek Tabor  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06242)  

**Abstract**: We present a novel technique for constructing differentiable order-type operations, including soft ranking, soft top-k selection, and soft permutations. Our approach leverages an efficient closed-form formula for the inverse of the function LapSum, defined as the sum of Laplace distributions. This formulation ensures low computational and memory complexity in selecting the highest activations, enabling losses and gradients to be computed in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for high-dimensional vectors and large $k$ values. Furthermore, we provide efficient implementations for both CPU and CUDA environments, underscoring the practicality and scalability of our method for large-scale ranking and differentiable ordering problems.

# Breaking Free from MMI: A New Frontier in Rationalization by Probing Input Utilization 

**Authors**: Wei Liu, Zhiying Deng, Zhongyu Niu, Jun Wang, Haozhao Wang, Zhigang Zeng, Ruixuan Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06202)  

**Abstract**: Extracting a small subset of crucial rationales from the full input is a key problem in explainability research. The most widely used fundamental criterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion. In this paper, we first demonstrate that MMI suffers from diminishing marginal returns. Once part of the rationale has been identified, finding the remaining portions contributes only marginally to increasing the mutual information, making it difficult to use MMI to locate the rest. In contrast to MMI that aims to reproduce the prediction, we seek to identify the parts of the input that the network can actually utilize.
This is achieved by comparing how different rationale candidates match the capability space of the weight matrix. The weight matrix of a neural network is typically low-rank, meaning that the linear combinations of its column vectors can only cover part of the directions in a high-dimensional space (high-dimension: the dimensions of an input vector). If an input is fully utilized by the network, {it generally matches these directions (e.g., a portion of a hypersphere), resulting in a representation with a high norm. Conversely, if an input primarily falls outside (orthogonal to) these directions}, its representation norm will approach zero, behaving like noise that the network cannot effectively utilize. Building on this, we propose using the norms of rationale candidates as an alternative objective to MMI. Through experiments on four text classification datasets and one graph classification dataset using three network architectures (GRUs, BERT, and GCN), we show that our method outperforms MMI and its improved variants in identifying better rationales. We also compare our method with a representative LLM (llama-3.1-8b-instruct) and find that our simple method gets comparable results to it and can sometimes even outperform it.

# Object-Centric World Model for Language-Guided Manipulation 

**Authors**: Youngjoon Jeong, Junha Chun, Soonwoo Cha, Taesup Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06170)  

**Abstract**: A world model is essential for an agent to predict the future and plan in domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. To achieve this, recent advancements have focused on video generation, which has gained significant attention due to the impressive success of diffusion models. However, these models require substantial computational resources. To address these challenges, we propose a world model leveraging object-centric representation space using slot attention, guided by language instructions. Our model perceives the current state as an object-centric representation and predicts future states in this representation space conditioned on natural language instructions. This approach results in a more compact and computationally efficient model compared to diffusion-based generative alternatives. Furthermore, it flexibly predicts future states based on language instructions, and offers a significant advantage in manipulation tasks where object recognition is crucial. In this paper, we demonstrate that our latent predictive world model surpasses generative world models in visuo-linguo-motor control tasks, achieving superior sample and computation efficiency. We also investigate the generalization performance of the proposed method and explore various strategies for predicting actions using object-centric representations.

# VACT: A Video Automatic Causal Testing System and a Benchmark 

**Authors**: Haotong Yang, Qingyuan Zheng, Yunjian Gao, Yongkun Yang, Yangbo He, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06163)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of text-conditioned Video Generation Models (VGMs), the quality of generated videos has significantly improved, bringing these models closer to functioning as ``*world simulators*'' and making real-world-level video generation more accessible and cost-effective. However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.

# System 0/1/2/3: Quad-process theory for multi-timescale embodied collective cognitive systems 

**Authors**: Tadahiro Taniguchi, Yasushi Hirai, Masahiro Suzuki, Shingo Murata, Takato Horii, Kazutoshi Tanaka  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06138)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

# MANDARIN: Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Dynamic Delirium and Coma Prediction in ICU Patients: Development and Validation of an Acute Brain Dysfunction Prediction Model 

**Authors**: Miguel Contreras, Jessica Sena, Andrea Davidson, Jiaqing Zhang, Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Yuanfang Ren, Ziyuan Guan, Jeremy Balch, Tyler Loftus, Subhash Nerella, Azra Bihorac, Parisa Rashidi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06059)  

**Abstract**: Acute brain dysfunction (ABD) is a common, severe ICU complication, presenting as delirium or coma and leading to prolonged stays, increased mortality, and cognitive decline. Traditional screening tools like the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) rely on intermittent assessments, causing delays and inconsistencies. In this study, we propose MANDARIN (Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Dynamic Delirium and Coma Prediction in ICU Patients), a 1.5M-parameter mixture-of-experts neural network to predict ABD in real-time among ICU patients. The model integrates temporal and static data from the ICU to predict the brain status in the next 12 to 72 hours, using a multi-branch approach to account for current brain status. The MANDARIN model was trained on data from 92,734 patients (132,997 ICU admissions) from 2 hospitals between 2008-2019 and validated externally on data from 11,719 patients (14,519 ICU admissions) from 15 hospitals and prospectively on data from 304 patients (503 ICU admissions) from one hospital in 2021-2024. Three datasets were used: the University of Florida Health (UFH) dataset, the electronic ICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU), and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. MANDARIN significantly outperforms the baseline neurological assessment scores (GCS, CAM, and RASS) for delirium prediction in both external (AUROC 75.5% CI: 74.2%-76.8% vs 68.3% CI: 66.9%-69.5%) and prospective (AUROC 82.0% CI: 74.8%-89.2% vs 72.7% CI: 65.5%-81.0%) cohorts, as well as for coma prediction (external AUROC 87.3% CI: 85.9%-89.0% vs 72.8% CI: 70.6%-74.9%, and prospective AUROC 93.4% CI: 88.5%-97.9% vs 67.7% CI: 57.7%-76.8%) with a 12-hour lead time. This tool has the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making by continuously monitoring the brain status of patients in the ICU.

# DSGBench: A Diverse Strategic Game Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-based Agents in Complex Decision-Making Environments 

**Authors**: Wenjie Tang, Yuan Zhou, Erqiang Xu, Keyan Cheng, Minne Li, Liquan Xiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06047)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Model~(LLM) based agents have been increasingly popular in solving complex and dynamic tasks, which requires proper evaluation systems to assess their capabilities. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks usually either focus on single-objective tasks or use overly broad assessing metrics, failing to provide a comprehensive inspection of the actual capabilities of LLM-based agents in complicated decision-making tasks. To address these issues, we introduce DSGBench, a more rigorous evaluation platform for strategic decision-making. Firstly, it incorporates six complex strategic games which serve as ideal testbeds due to their long-term and multi-dimensional decision-making demands and flexibility in customizing tasks of various difficulty levels or multiple targets. Secondly, DSGBench employs a fine-grained evaluation scoring system which examines the decision-making capabilities by looking into the performance in five specific dimensions and offering a comprehensive assessment in a well-designed way. Furthermore, DSGBench also incorporates an automated decision-tracking mechanism which enables in-depth analysis of agent behaviour patterns and the changes in their strategies. We demonstrate the advances of DSGBench by applying it to multiple popular LLM-based agents and our results suggest that DSGBench provides valuable insights in choosing LLM-based agents as well as improving their future development. DSGBench is available at this https URL.

# Bayesian Graph Traversal 

**Authors**: William N. Caballero, Phillip R. Jenkins, David Banks, Matthew Robbins  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05963)  

**Abstract**: This research considers Bayesian decision-analytic approaches toward the traversal of an uncertain graph. Namely, a traveler progresses over a graph in which rewards are gained upon a node's first visit and costs are incurred for every edge traversal. The traveler knows the graph's adjacency matrix and his starting position but does not know the rewards and costs. The traveler is a Bayesian who encodes his beliefs about these values using a Gaussian process prior and who seeks to maximize his expected utility over these beliefs. Adopting a decision-analytic perspective, we develop sequential decision-making solution strategies for this coupled information-collection and network-routing problem. We show that the problem is NP-Hard and derive properties of the optimal walk. These properties provide heuristics for the traveler's problem that balance exploration and exploitation. We provide a practical case study focused on the use of unmanned aerial systems for public safety and empirically study policy performance in myriad Erdos-Renyi settings.

# Enhancing Reasoning with Collaboration and Memory 

**Authors**: Julie Michelman, Nasrin Baratalipour, Matthew Abueg  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05944)  

**Abstract**: We envision a continuous collaborative learning system where groups of LLM agents work together to solve reasoning problems, drawing on memory they collectively build to improve performance as they gain experience. This work establishes the foundations for such a system by studying the interoperability of chain-of-thought reasoning styles, multi-agent collaboration, and memory banks. Extending beyond the identical agents of self-consistency, we introduce varied-context agents with diverse exemplars and a summarizer agent in place of voting. We generate frozen and continuously learned memory banks of exemplars and pair them with fixed, random, and similarity-based retrieval mechanisms. Our systematic study reveals where various methods contribute to reasoning performance of two LLMs on three grounded reasoning tasks, showing that random exemplar selection can often beat more principled approaches, and in some tasks, inclusion of any exemplars serves only to distract both weak and strong models.

# Quantum-like cognition and decision making in the light of quantum measurement theory 

**Authors**: Miho Fuyama, Andrei Khrennikov, Masanao Ozawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05859)  

**Abstract**: We characterize the class of quantum measurements that matches the applications of quantum theory to cognition (and decision making) - quantum-like modeling. Projective measurements describe the canonical measurements of the basic observables of quantum physics. However, the combinations of the basic cognitive effects, such as the question order and response replicability effects, cannot be described by projective measurements. We motivate the use of the special class of quantum measurements, namely {\it sharp repeatable non-projective measurements} - ${\cal SR\bar{P}}. $ This class is practically unused in quantum physics. Thus, physics and cognition explore different parts of quantum measurement theory. Quantum-like modeling isn't automatic borrowing of the quantum formalism. Exploring the class ${\cal SR\bar{P}}$ highlights the role of {\it noncommutativity of the state update maps generated by measurement back action.} Thus, ``non-classicality'' in quantum physics as well as quantum-like modeling for cognition is based on two different types of noncommutativity, of operators (observables) and instruments (state update maps): {\it observable-noncommutativity} vs. {\it state update-noncommutativity}. We speculate that distinguishing quantum-like properties of the cognitive effects are the expressions of the latter, or possibly both.

# Market-based Architectures in RL and Beyond 

**Authors**: Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, Long Tran-Thanh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05828)  

**Abstract**: Market-based agents refer to reinforcement learning agents which determine their actions based on an internal market of sub-agents. We introduce a new type of market-based algorithm where the state itself is factored into several axes called ``goods'', which allows for greater specialization and parallelism than existing market-based RL algorithms. Furthermore, we argue that market-based algorithms have the potential to address many current challenges in AI, such as search, dynamic scaling and complete feedback, and demonstrate that they may be seen to generalize neural networks; finally, we list some novel ways that market algorithms may be applied in conjunction with Large Language Models for immediate practical applicability.

# DriveGen: Towards Infinite Diverse Traffic Scenarios with Large Models 

**Authors**: Shenyu Zhang, Jiaguo Tian, Zhengbang Zhu, Shan Huang, Jucheng Yang, Weinan Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05808)  

**Abstract**: Microscopic traffic simulation has become an important tool for autonomous driving training and testing. Although recent data-driven approaches advance realistic behavior generation, their learning still relies primarily on a single real-world dataset, which limits their diversity and thereby hinders downstream algorithm optimization. In this paper, we propose DriveGen, a novel traffic simulation framework with large models for more diverse traffic generation that supports further customized designs. DriveGen consists of two internal stages: the initialization stage uses large language model and retrieval technique to generate map and vehicle assets; the rollout stage outputs trajectories with selected waypoint goals from visual language model and a specific designed diffusion planner. Through this two-staged process, DriveGen fully utilizes large models' high-level cognition and reasoning of driving behavior, obtaining greater diversity beyond datasets while maintaining high realism. To support effective downstream optimization, we additionally develop DriveGen-CS, an automatic corner case generation pipeline that uses failures of the driving algorithm as additional prompt knowledge for large models without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Experiments show that our generated scenarios and corner cases have a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Downstream experiments further verify that the synthesized traffic of DriveGen provides better optimization of the performance of typical driving algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.

# A Comprehensive Survey of Fuzzy Implication Functions 

**Authors**: Raquel Fernandez-Peralta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05702)  

**Abstract**: Fuzzy implication functions are a key area of study in fuzzy logic, extending the classical logical conditional to handle truth degrees in the interval $[0,1]$. While existing literature often focuses on a limited number of families, in the last ten years many new families have been introduced, each defined by specific construction methods and having different key properties. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of the diverse families of fuzzy implication functions, emphasizing their motivations, properties, and potential applications. By organizing the information schematically, this document serves as a valuable resource for both theoretical researchers seeking to avoid redundancy and practitioners looking to select appropriate operators for specific applications.

# NeuroChat: A Neuroadaptive AI Chatbot for Customizing Learning Experiences 

**Authors**: Dünya Baradari, Nataliya Kosmyna, Oscar Petrov, Rebecah Kaplun, Pattie Maes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07599)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI is transforming education by enabling personalized, on-demand learning experiences. However, AI tutors lack the ability to assess a learner's cognitive state in real time, limiting their adaptability. Meanwhile, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neuroadaptive systems have successfully enhanced engagement by dynamically adjusting learning content. This paper presents NeuroChat, a proof-of-concept neuroadaptive AI tutor that integrates real-time EEG-based engagement tracking with generative AI. NeuroChat continuously monitors a learner's cognitive engagement and dynamically adjusts content complexity, response style, and pacing using a closed-loop system. We evaluate this approach in a pilot study (n=24), comparing NeuroChat to a standard LLM-based chatbot. Results indicate that NeuroChat enhances cognitive and subjective engagement but does not show an immediate effect on learning outcomes. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of real-time cognitive feedback in LLMs, highlighting new directions for adaptive learning, AI tutoring, and human-AI interaction.

# Denoising Hamiltonian Network for Physical Reasoning 

**Authors**: Congyue Deng, Brandon Y. Feng, Cecilia Garraffo, Alan Garbarz, Robin Walters, William T. Freeman, Leonidas Guibas, Kaiming He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07596)  

**Abstract**: Machine learning frameworks for physical problems must capture and enforce physical constraints that preserve the structure of dynamical systems. Many existing approaches achieve this by integrating physical operators into neural networks. While these methods offer theoretical guarantees, they face two key limitations: (i) they primarily model local relations between adjacent time steps, overlooking longer-range or higher-level physical interactions, and (ii) they focus on forward simulation while neglecting broader physical reasoning tasks. We propose the Denoising Hamiltonian Network (DHN), a novel framework that generalizes Hamiltonian mechanics operators into more flexible neural operators. DHN captures non-local temporal relationships and mitigates numerical integration errors through a denoising mechanism. DHN also supports multi-system modeling with a global conditioning mechanism. We demonstrate its effectiveness and flexibility across three diverse physical reasoning tasks with distinct inputs and outputs.

# Filter Images First, Generate Instructions Later: Pre-Instruction Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning 

**Authors**: Bardia Safaei, Faizan Siddiqui, Jiacong Xu, Vishal M. Patel, Shao-Yuan Lo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07591)  

**Abstract**: Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

# When Large Vision-Language Model Meets Large Remote Sensing Imagery: Coarse-to-Fine Text-Guided Token Pruning 

**Authors**: Junwei Luo, Yingying Zhang, Xue Yang, Kang Wu, Qi Zhu, Lei Liang, Jingdong Chen, Yansheng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07588)  

**Abstract**: Efficient vision-language understanding of large Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) is meaningful but challenging. Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings. Dataset and code are in this https URL.

# Robusto-1 Dataset: Comparing Humans and VLMs on real out-of-distribution Autonomous Driving VQA from Peru 

**Authors**: Dunant Cusipuma, David Ortega, Victor Flores-Benites, Arturo Deza  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07587)  

**Abstract**: As multimodal foundational models start being deployed experimentally in Self-Driving cars, a reasonable question we ask ourselves is how similar to humans do these systems respond in certain driving situations -- especially those that are out-of-distribution? To study this, we create the Robusto-1 dataset that uses dashcam video data from Peru, a country with one of the worst (aggressive) drivers in the world, a high traffic index, and a high ratio of bizarre to non-bizarre street objects likely never seen in training. In particular, to preliminarly test at a cognitive level how well Foundational Visual Language Models (VLMs) compare to Humans in Driving, we move away from bounding boxes, segmentation maps, occupancy maps or trajectory estimation to multi-modal Visual Question Answering (VQA) comparing both humans and machines through a popular method in systems neuroscience known as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA). Depending on the type of questions we ask and the answers these systems give, we will show in what cases do VLMs and Humans converge or diverge allowing us to probe on their cognitive alignment. We find that the degree of alignment varies significantly depending on the type of questions asked to each type of system (Humans vs VLMs), highlighting a gap in their alignment.

# Denoising Score Distillation: From Noisy Diffusion Pretraining to One-Step High-Quality Generation 

**Authors**: Tianyu Chen, Yasi Zhang, Zhendong Wang, Ying Nian Wu, Oscar Leong, Mingyuan Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07578)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-resolution, realistic images across diverse natural distributions. However, their performance heavily relies on high-quality training data, making it challenging to learn meaningful distributions from corrupted samples. This limitation restricts their applicability in scientific domains where clean data is scarce or costly to obtain. In this work, we introduce denoising score distillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training high-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a diffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it into a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While score distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion models, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality, particularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise levels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe summarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace of the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the generator. This perspective reframes score distillation as not only a tool for efficiency but also a mechanism for improving generative models, particularly in low-quality data settings.

# Optimizing Test-Time Compute via Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Yuxiao Qu, Matthew Y. R. Yang, Amrith Setlur, Lewis Tunstall, Edward Emanuel Beeching, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Aviral Kumar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07572)  

**Abstract**: Training models to effectively use test-time compute is crucial for improving the reasoning performance of LLMs. Current methods mostly do so via fine-tuning on search traces or running RL with 0/1 outcome reward, but do these approaches efficiently utilize test-time compute? Would these approaches continue to scale as the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We formalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement learning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending test-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream from the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to use a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the efficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff exploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would also provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token stream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one can do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome 0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in the output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual success. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or MRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT leads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token efficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.

# Runtime Detection of Adversarial Attacks in AI Accelerators Using Performance Counters 

**Authors**: Habibur Rahaman, Atri Chatterjee, Swarup Bhunia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07568)  

**Abstract**: Rapid adoption of AI technologies raises several major security concerns, including the risks of adversarial perturbations, which threaten the confidentiality and integrity of AI applications. Protecting AI hardware from misuse and diverse security threats is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we propose SAMURAI, a novel framework for safeguarding against malicious usage of AI hardware and its resilience to attacks. SAMURAI introduces an AI Performance Counter (APC) for tracking dynamic behavior of an AI model coupled with an on-chip Machine Learning (ML) analysis engine, known as TANTO (Trained Anomaly Inspection Through Trace Observation). APC records the runtime profile of the low-level hardware events of different AI operations. Subsequently, the summary information recorded by the APC is processed by TANTO to efficiently identify potential security breaches and ensure secure, responsible use of AI. SAMURAI enables real-time detection of security threats and misuse without relying on traditional software-based solutions that require model integration. Experimental results demonstrate that SAMURAI achieves up to 97% accuracy in detecting adversarial attacks with moderate overhead on various AI models, significantly outperforming conventional software-based approaches. It enhances security and regulatory compliance, providing a comprehensive solution for safeguarding AI against emergent threats.

# Inductive Moment Matching 

**Authors**: Linqi Zhou, Stefano Ermon, Jiaming Song  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07565)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion models and Flow Matching generate high-quality samples but are slow at inference, and distilling them into few-step models often leads to instability and extensive tuning. To resolve these trade-offs, we propose Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a new class of generative models for one- or few-step sampling with a single-stage training procedure. Unlike distillation, IMM does not require pre-training initialization and optimization of two networks; and unlike Consistency Models, IMM guarantees distribution-level convergence and remains stable under various hyperparameters and standard model architectures. IMM surpasses diffusion models on ImageNet-256x256 with 1.99 FID using only 8 inference steps and achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on CIFAR-10 for a model trained from scratch.

# KSOD: Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand 

**Authors**: Haoran Li, Junfeng Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07550)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet still produce errors in domain-specific tasks. To further improve their performance, we propose KSOD (Knowledge Supplement for LLMs On Demand), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to improve their capabilities with knowledge-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT). KSOD analyzes the causes of errors from the perspective of knowledge deficiency by identifying potential missing knowledge in LLM that may lead to the errors. Subsequently, KSOD tunes a knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the identified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD supplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module. Tuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and knowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four general benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance of LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their performance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of improving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.

# Geometric Retargeting: A Principled, Ultrafast Neural Hand Retargeting Algorithm 

**Authors**: Zhao-Heng Yin, Changhao Wang, Luis Pineda, Krishna Bodduluri, Tingfan Wu, Pieter Abbeel, Mustafa Mukadam  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07541)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Geometric Retargeting (GeoRT), an ultrafast, and principled neural hand retargeting algorithm for teleoperation, developed as part of our recent Dexterity Gen (DexGen) system. GeoRT converts human finger keypoints to robot hand keypoints at 1KHz, achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy with significantly fewer hyperparameters. This high-speed capability enables flexible postprocessing, such as leveraging a foundational controller for action correction like DexGen. GeoRT is trained in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for manual annotation of hand pairs. The core of GeoRT lies in novel geometric objective functions that capture the essence of retargeting: preserving motion fidelity, ensuring configuration space (C-space) coverage, maintaining uniform response through high flatness, pinch correspondence and preventing self-collisions. This approach is free from intensive test-time optimization, offering a more scalable and practical solution for real-time hand retargeting.

# LMM-R1: Empowering 3B LMMs with Strong Reasoning Abilities Through Two-Stage Rule-Based RL 

**Authors**: Yingzhe Peng, Gongrui Zhang, Miaosen Zhang, Zhiyuan You, Jie Liu, Qipeng Zhu, Kai Yang, Xingzhong Xu, Xin Geng, Xu Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07536)  

**Abstract**: Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges from the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning, particularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural constraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.
While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its multimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due to ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded foundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{\method}, a two-stage framework adapting rule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \textbf{Foundational Reasoning Enhancement (FRE)} followed by \textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training (MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only data with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning capabilities to multimodal domains.
Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that \method achieves 4.83\% and 4.5\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only benchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\% gain in complex Football Game tasks. These results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective multimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses costly high-quality multimodal training data.

# TokenButler: Token Importance is Predictable 

**Authors**: Yash Akhauri, Ahmed F AbouElhamayed, Yifei Gao, Chi-Chih Chang, Nilesh Jain, Mohamed S. Abdelfattah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07518)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the Key-Value (KV) Cache to store token history, enabling efficient decoding of tokens. As the KV-Cache grows, it becomes a major memory and computation bottleneck, however, there is an opportunity to alleviate this bottleneck, especially because prior research has shown that only a small subset of tokens contribute meaningfully to each decoding step. A key challenge in finding these critical tokens is that they are dynamic, and heavily input query-dependent. Existing methods either risk quality by evicting tokens permanently, or retain the full KV-Cache but rely on retrieving chunks (pages) of tokens at generation, failing at dense, context-rich tasks. Additionally, many existing KV-Cache sparsity methods rely on inaccurate proxies for token importance. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenButler, a high-granularity, query-aware predictor that learns to identify these critical tokens. By training a light-weight predictor with less than 1.2% parameter overhead, TokenButler prioritizes tokens based on their contextual, predicted importance. This improves perplexity & downstream accuracy by over 8% relative to SoTA methods for estimating token importance. We evaluate TokenButler on a novel synthetic small-context co-referential retrieval task, demonstrating near-oracle accuracy. Code, models and benchmarks: this https URL

# Language Models Fail to Introspect About Their Knowledge of Language 

**Authors**: Siyuan Song, Jennifer Hu, Kyle Mahowald  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07513)  

**Abstract**: There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can introspect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more interpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in linguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking "Is this sentence grammatical?"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection across 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of theoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in both domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically grounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether models' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal knowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a model's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what would be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge. While both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high task accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged "self-access". Our findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect, and add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be conflated with models' linguistic generalizations.

# Interference-Aware Super-Constellation Design for NOMA 

**Authors**: Mojtaba Vaezi, Xinliang Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07509)  

**Abstract**: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems

# From Centralized to Decentralized Federated Learning: Theoretical Insights, Privacy Preservation, and Robustness Challenges 

**Authors**: Qiongxiu Li, Wenrui Yu, Yufei Xia, Jun Pang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07505)  

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without directly sharing individual's raw data. FL can be implemented in either a centralized (server-based) or decentralized (peer-to-peer) manner. In this survey, we present a novel perspective: the fundamental difference between centralized FL (CFL) and decentralized FL (DFL) is not merely the network topology, but the underlying training protocol: separate aggregation vs. joint optimization. We argue that this distinction in protocol leads to significant differences in model utility, privacy preservation, and robustness to attacks. We systematically review and categorize existing works in both CFL and DFL according to the type of protocol they employ. This taxonomy provides deeper insights into prior research and clarifies how various approaches relate or differ. Through our analysis, we identify key gaps in the literature. In particular, we observe a surprising lack of exploration of DFL approaches based on distributed optimization methods, despite their potential advantages. We highlight this under-explored direction and call for more research on leveraging distributed optimization for federated learning. Overall, this work offers a comprehensive overview from centralized to decentralized FL, sheds new light on the core distinctions between approaches, and outlines open challenges and future directions for the field.

# V2Flow: Unifying Visual Tokenization and Large Language Model Vocabularies for Autoregressive Image Generation 

**Authors**: Guiwei Zhang, Tianyu Zhang, Mohan Zhou, Yalong Bai, Biye Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07493)  

**Abstract**: We propose V2Flow, a novel tokenizer that produces discrete visual tokens capable of high-fidelity reconstruction, while ensuring structural and latent distribution alignment with the vocabulary space of large language models (LLMs). Leveraging this tight visual-vocabulary coupling, V2Flow enables autoregressive visual generation on top of existing LLMs. Our approach formulates visual tokenization as a flow-matching problem, aiming to learn a mapping from a standard normal prior to the continuous image distribution, conditioned on token sequences embedded within the LLMs vocabulary space. The effectiveness of V2Flow stems from two core designs. First, we propose a Visual Vocabulary resampler, which compresses visual data into compact token sequences, with each represented as a soft categorical distribution over LLM's vocabulary. This allows seamless integration of visual tokens into existing LLMs for autoregressive visual generation. Second, we present a masked autoregressive Rectified-Flow decoder, employing a masked transformer encoder-decoder to refine visual tokens into contextually enriched embeddings. These embeddings then condition a dedicated velocity field for precise reconstruction. Additionally, an autoregressive rectified-flow sampling strategy is incorporated, ensuring flexible sequence lengths while preserving competitive reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments show that V2Flow outperforms mainstream VQ-based tokenizers and facilitates autoregressive visual generation on top of existing. this https URL

# Efficient Membership Inference Attacks by Bayesian Neural Network 

**Authors**: Zhenlong Liu, Wenyu Jiang, Feng Zhou, Hongxin Wei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07482)  

**Abstract**: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to estimate whether a specific data point was used in the training of a given model. Previous attacks often utilize multiple reference models to approximate the conditional score distribution, leading to significant computational overhead. While recent work leverages quantile regression to estimate conditional thresholds, it fails to capture epistemic uncertainty, resulting in bias in low-density regions. In this work, we propose a novel approach - Bayesian Membership Inference Attack (BMIA), which performs conditional attack through Bayesian inference. In particular, we transform a trained reference model into Bayesian neural networks by Laplace approximation, enabling the direct estimation of the conditional score distribution by probabilistic model parameters. Our method addresses both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty with only a reference model, enabling efficient and powerful MIA. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of BMIA.

# Advancing Vietnamese Information Retrieval with Learning Objective and Benchmark 

**Authors**: Phu-Vinh Nguyen, Minh-Nam Tran, Long Nguyen, Dien Dinh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07470)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of natural language processing, many language models have been invented for multiple tasks. One important task is information retrieval (IR), which requires models to retrieve relevant documents. Despite its importance in many real-life applications, especially in retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems, this task lacks Vietnamese benchmarks. This situation causes difficulty in assessing and comparing many existing Vietnamese embedding language models on the task and slows down the advancement of Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) research. In this work, we aim to provide the Vietnamese research community with a new benchmark for information retrieval, which mainly focuses on retrieval and reranking tasks. Furthermore, we also present a new objective function based on the InfoNCE loss function, which is used to train our Vietnamese embedding model. Our function aims to be better than the origin in information retrieval tasks. Finally, we analyze the effect of temperature, a hyper-parameter in both objective functions, on the performance of text embedding models.

# MedAgentsBench: Benchmarking Thinking Models and Agent Frameworks for Complex Medical Reasoning 

**Authors**: Xiangru Tang, Daniel Shao, Jiwoong Sohn, Jiapeng Chen, Jiayi Zhang, Jinyu Xiang, Fang Wu, Yilun Zhao, Chenglin Wu, Wenqi Shi, Arman Cohan, Mark Gerstein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07459)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on existing medical question-answering benchmarks. This high performance makes it increasingly difficult to meaningfully evaluate and differentiate advanced methods. We present MedAgentsBench, a benchmark that focuses on challenging medical questions requiring multi-step clinical reasoning, diagnosis formulation, and treatment planning-scenarios where current models still struggle despite their strong performance on standard tests. Drawing from seven established medical datasets, our benchmark addresses three key limitations in existing evaluations: (1) the prevalence of straightforward questions where even base models achieve high performance, (2) inconsistent sampling and evaluation protocols across studies, and (3) lack of systematic analysis of the interplay between performance, cost, and inference time. Through experiments with various base models and reasoning methods, we demonstrate that the latest thinking models, DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3, exhibit exceptional performance in complex medical reasoning tasks. Additionally, advanced search-based agent methods offer promising performance-to-cost ratios compared to traditional approaches. Our analysis reveals substantial performance gaps between model families on complex questions and identifies optimal model selections for different computational constraints. Our benchmark and evaluation framework are publicly available at this https URL.

# Is a Good Foundation Necessary for Efficient Reinforcement Learning? The Computational Role of the Base Model in Exploration 

**Authors**: Dylan J. Foster, Zakaria Mhammedi, Dhruv Rohatgi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07453)  

**Abstract**: Language model alignment (or, reinforcement learning) techniques that leverage active exploration -- deliberately encouraging the model to produce diverse, informative responses -- offer the promise of super-human capabilities. However, current understanding of algorithm design primitives for computationally efficient exploration with language models is limited. To better understand how to leverage access to powerful pre-trained generative models to improve the efficiency of exploration, we introduce a new computational framework for RL with language models, in which the learner interacts with the model through a sampling oracle. Focusing on the linear softmax model parameterization, we provide new results that reveal the computational-statistical tradeoffs of efficient exploration:
1. Necessity of coverage: Coverage refers to the extent to which the pre-trained model covers near-optimal responses -- a form of hidden knowledge. We show that coverage, while not necessary for data efficiency, lower bounds the runtime of any algorithm in our framework.
2. Inference-time exploration: We introduce a new algorithm, SpannerSampling, which obtains optimal data efficiency and is computationally efficient whenever the pre-trained model enjoys sufficient coverage, matching our lower bound. SpannerSampling leverages inference-time computation with the pre-trained model to reduce the effective search space for exploration.
3. Insufficiency of training-time interventions: We contrast the result above by showing that training-time interventions that produce proper policies cannot achieve similar guarantees in polynomial time.
4. Computational benefits of multi-turn exploration: Finally, we show that under additional representational assumptions, one can achieve improved runtime (replacing sequence-level coverage with token-level coverage) through multi-turn exploration.

# Divide and Conquer Self-Supervised Learning for High-Content Imaging 

**Authors**: Lucas Farndale, Paul Henderson, Edward W Roberts, Ke Yuan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07444)  

**Abstract**: Self-supervised representation learning methods often fail to learn subtle or complex features, which can be dominated by simpler patterns which are much easier to learn. This limitation is particularly problematic in applications to science and engineering, as complex features can be critical for discovery and analysis. To address this, we introduce Split Component Embedding Registration (SpliCER), a novel architecture which splits the image into sections and distils information from each section to guide the model to learn more subtle and complex features without compromising on simpler features. SpliCER is compatible with any self-supervised loss function and can be integrated into existing methods without modification. The primary contributions of this work are as follows: i) we demonstrate that existing self-supervised methods can learn shortcut solutions when simple and complex features are both present; ii) we introduce a novel self-supervised training method, SpliCER, to overcome the limitations of existing methods, and achieve significant downstream performance improvements; iii) we demonstrate the effectiveness of SpliCER in cutting-edge medical and geospatial imaging settings. SpliCER offers a powerful new tool for representation learning, enabling models to uncover complex features which could be overlooked by other methods.

# RePO: ReLU-based Preference Optimization 

**Authors**: Junkang Wu, Kexin Huang, Xue Wang, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Jiancan Wu, Xiangnan He, Xiang Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07426)  

**Abstract**: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical for real-world deployment, yet existing methods like RLHF face computational and stability challenges. While DPO establishes an offline paradigm with single hyperparameter $\beta$, subsequent methods like SimPO reintroduce complexity through dual parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$). We propose {ReLU-based Preference Optimization (RePO)}, a streamlined algorithm that eliminates $\beta$ via two advances: (1) retaining SimPO's reference-free margins but removing $\beta$ through gradient analysis, and (2) adopting a ReLU-based max-margin loss that naturally filters trivial pairs. Theoretically, RePO is characterized as SimPO's limiting case ($\beta \to \infty$), where the logistic weighting collapses to binary thresholding, forming a convex envelope of the 0-1 loss. Empirical results on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that RePO outperforms DPO and SimPO across multiple base models, requiring only one hyperparameter to tune.

# Brain Inspired Adaptive Memory Dual-Net for Few-Shot Image Classification 

**Authors**: Kexin Di, Xiuxing Li, Yuyang Han, Ziyu Li, Qing Li, Xia Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07396)  

**Abstract**: Few-shot image classification has become a popular research topic for its wide application in real-world scenarios, however the problem of supervision collapse induced by single image-level annotation remains a major challenge. Existing methods aim to tackle this problem by locating and aligning relevant local features. However, the high intra-class variability in real-world images poses significant challenges in locating semantically relevant local regions under few-shot settings. Drawing inspiration from the human's complementary learning system, which excels at rapidly capturing and integrating semantic features from limited examples, we propose the generalization-optimized Systems Consolidation Adaptive Memory Dual-Network, SCAM-Net. This approach simulates the systems consolidation of complementary learning system with an adaptive memory module, which successfully addresses the difficulty of identifying meaningful features in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, we construct a Hippocampus-Neocortex dual-network that consolidates structured representation of each category, the structured representation is then stored and adaptively regulated following the generalization optimization principle in a long-term memory inside Neocortex. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed model has achieved state-of-the-art performance.

# TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Ruidong Chen, Honglin Guo, Lanjun Wang, Chenyu Zhang, Weizhi Nie, An-An Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07389)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: this http URL. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.

# Is My Text in Your AI Model? Gradient-based Membership Inference Test applied to LLMs 

**Authors**: Gonzalo Mancera, Daniel de Alcala, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Tolosana, Aythami Morales  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07384)  

**Abstract**: This work adapts and studies the gradient-based Membership Inference Test (gMINT) to the classification of text based on LLMs. MINT is a general approach intended to determine if given data was used for training machine learning models, and this work focuses on its application to the domain of Natural Language Processing. Using gradient-based analysis, the MINT model identifies whether particular data samples were included during the language model training phase, addressing growing concerns about data privacy in machine learning. The method was evaluated in seven Transformer-based models and six datasets comprising over 2.5 million sentences, focusing on text classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate MINTs robustness, achieving AUC scores between 85% and 99%, depending on data size and model architecture. These findings highlight MINTs potential as a scalable and reliable tool for auditing machine learning models, ensuring transparency, safeguarding sensitive data, and fostering ethical compliance in the deployment of AI/NLP technologies.

# Artificial Utopia: Simulation and Intelligent Agents for a Democratised Future 

**Authors**: Yannick Oswald  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07364)  

**Abstract**: Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.

# The Economics of p(doom): Scenarios of Existential Risk and Economic Growth in the Age of Transformative AI 

**Authors**: Jakub Growiec, Klaus Prettner  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07341)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a diverse set of predictions about its long-term impact on humanity. A central focus is the potential emergence of transformative AI (TAI), eventually capable of outperforming humans in all economically valuable tasks and fully automating labor. Discussed scenarios range from human extinction after a misaligned TAI takes over ("AI doom") to unprecedented economic growth and abundance ("post-scarcity"). However, the probabilities and implications of these scenarios remain highly uncertain. Here, we organize the various scenarios and evaluate their associated existential risks and economic outcomes in terms of aggregate welfare. Our analysis shows that even low-probability catastrophic outcomes justify large investments in AI safety and alignment research. We find that the optimizing representative individual would rationally allocate substantial resources to mitigate extinction risk; in some cases, she would prefer not to develop TAI at all. This result highlights that current global efforts in AI safety and alignment research are vastly insufficient relative to the scale and urgency of existential risks posed by TAI. Our findings therefore underscore the need for stronger safeguards to balance the potential economic benefits of TAI with the prevention of irreversible harm. Addressing these risks is crucial for steering technological progress toward sustainable human prosperity.

# Research and Design on Intelligent Recognition of Unordered Targets for Robots Based on Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Yiting Mao, Dajun Tao, Shengyuan Zhang, Tian Qi, Keqin Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07340)  

**Abstract**: In the field of robot target recognition research driven by artificial intelligence (AI), factors such as the disordered distribution of targets, the complexity of the environment, the massive scale of data, and noise interference have significantly restricted the improvement of target recognition accuracy. Against the backdrop of the continuous iteration and upgrading of current AI technologies, to meet the demand for accurate recognition of disordered targets by intelligent robots in complex and changeable scenarios, this study innovatively proposes an AI - based intelligent robot disordered target recognition method using reinforcement learning. This method processes the collected target images with the bilateral filtering algorithm, decomposing them into low - illumination images and reflection images. Subsequently, it adopts differentiated AI strategies, compressing the illumination images and enhancing the reflection images respectively, and then fuses the two parts of images to generate a new image. On this basis, this study deeply integrates deep learning, a core AI technology, with the reinforcement learning algorithm. The enhanced target images are input into a deep reinforcement learning model for training, ultimately enabling the AI - based intelligent robot to efficiently recognize disordered targets. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only significantly improve the quality of target images but also enable the AI - based intelligent robot to complete the recognition task of disordered targets with higher efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating extremely high application value and broad development prospects in the field of AI robots.

# Temporal Triplane Transformers as Occupancy World Models 

**Authors**: Haoran Xu, Peixi Peng, Guang Tan, Yiqian Chang, Yisen Zhao, Yonghong Tian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07338)  

**Abstract**: Recent years have seen significant advances in world models, which primarily focus on learning fine-grained correlations between an agent's motion trajectory and the resulting changes in its surrounding environment. However, existing methods often struggle to capture such fine-grained correlations and achieve real-time predictions. To address this, we propose a new 4D occupancy world model for autonomous driving, termed T$^3$Former. T$^3$Former begins by pre-training a compact triplane representation that efficiently compresses the 3D semantically occupied environment. Next, T$^3$Former extracts multi-scale temporal motion features from the historical triplane and employs an autoregressive approach to iteratively predict the next triplane changes. Finally, T$^3$Former combines the triplane changes with the previous ones to decode them into future occupancy results and ego-motion trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of T$^3$Former, achieving 1.44$\times$ faster inference speed (26 FPS), while improving the mean IoU to 36.09 and reducing the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters.

# Mitigating Hallucinations in YOLO-based Object Detection Models: A Revisit to Out-of-Distribution Detection 

**Authors**: Weicheng He, Changshun Wu, Chih-Hong Cheng, Xiaowei Huang, Saddek Bensalem  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07330)  

**Abstract**: Object detection systems must reliably perceive objects of interest without being overly confident to ensure safe decision-making in dynamic environments. Filtering techniques based on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection are commonly added as an extra safeguard to filter hallucinations caused by overconfidence in novel objects. Nevertheless, evaluating YOLO-family detectors and their filters under existing OoD benchmarks often leads to unsatisfactory performance. This paper studies the underlying reasons for performance bottlenecks and proposes a methodology to improve performance fundamentally. Our first contribution is a calibration of all existing evaluation results: Although images in existing OoD benchmark datasets are claimed not to have objects within in-distribution (ID) classes (i.e., categories defined in the training dataset), around 13% of objects detected by the object detector are actually ID objects. Dually, the ID dataset containing OoD objects can also negatively impact the decision boundary of filters. These ultimately lead to a significantly imprecise performance estimation. Our second contribution is to consider the task of hallucination reduction as a joint pipeline of detectors and filters. By developing a methodology to carefully synthesize an OoD dataset that semantically resembles the objects to be detected, and using the crafted OoD dataset in the fine-tuning of YOLO detectors to suppress the objectness score, we achieve a 88% reduction in overall hallucination error with a combined fine-tuned detection and filtering system on the self-driving benchmark BDD-100K. Our code and dataset are available at: this https URL.

**Authors**: Hao Zhou, Guergana Savova, Lijing Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07329)  

**Abstract**: The impact of random seeds in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) has been largely overlooked despite its potential influence on model this http URL this study, we systematically evaluate the effects of random seeds on LLMs using the GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks. We analyze the macro-level impact through traditional metrics like accuracy and F1, calculating their mean and variance to quantify performance fluctuations. To capture the micro-level effects, we introduce a novel metric, consistency, measuring the stability of individual predictions across runs. Our experiments reveal significant variance at both macro and micro levels, underscoring the need for careful consideration of random seeds in fine-tuning and evaluation.

# AI Biases as Asymmetries: A Review to Guide Practice 

**Authors**: Gabriella Waters, Phillip Honenberger  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07326)  

**Abstract**: The understanding of bias in AI is currently undergoing a revolution. Initially understood as errors or flaws, biases are increasingly recognized as integral to AI systems and sometimes preferable to less biased alternatives. In this paper, we review the reasons for this changed understanding and provide new guidance on two questions: First, how should we think about and measure biases in AI systems, consistent with the new understanding? Second, what kinds of bias in an AI system should we accept or even amplify, and what kinds should we minimize or eliminate, and why? The key to answering both questions, we argue, is to understand biases as "violations of a symmetry standard" (following Kelly). We distinguish three main types of asymmetry in AI systems-error biases, inequality biases, and process biases-and highlight places in the pipeline of AI development and application where bias of each type is likely to be good, bad, or inevitable.

# Dynamic Path Navigation for Motion Agents with LLM Reasoning 

**Authors**: Yubo Zhao, Qi Wu, Yifan Wang, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07323)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalizable reasoning and planning capabilities. However, their efficacies in spatial path planning and obstacle-free trajectory generation remain underexplored. Leveraging LLMs for navigation holds significant potential, given LLMs' ability to handle unseen scenarios, support user-agent interactions, and provide global control across complex systems, making them well-suited for agentic planning and humanoid motion generation. As one of the first studies in this domain, we explore the zero-shot navigation and path generation capabilities of LLMs by constructing a dataset and proposing an evaluation protocol. Specifically, we represent paths using anchor points connected by straight lines, enabling movement in various directions. This approach offers greater flexibility and practicality compared to previous methods while remaining simple and intuitive for LLMs. We demonstrate that, when tasks are well-structured in this manner, modern LLMs exhibit substantial planning proficiency in avoiding obstacles while autonomously refining navigation with the generated motion to reach the target. Further, this spatial reasoning ability of a single LLM motion agent interacting in a static environment can be seamlessly generalized in multi-motion agents coordination in dynamic environments. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on single-step planning or local policies, our training-free LLM-based method enables global, dynamic, closed-loop planning, and autonomously resolving collision issues.

# Experimental Exploration: Investigating Cooperative Interaction Behavior Between Humans and Large Language Model Agents 

**Authors**: Guanxuan Jiang, Yuyang Wang, Pan Hui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07320)  

**Abstract**: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI agents as autonomous decision-makers present significant opportunities and challenges for human-AI cooperation. While many studies have explored human cooperation with AI as tools, the role of LLM-augmented autonomous agents in competitive-cooperative interactions remains under-examined. This study investigates human cooperative behavior by engaging 30 participants who interacted with LLM agents exhibiting different characteristics (purported human, purported rule-based AI agent, and LLM agent) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Findings show significant differences in cooperative behavior based on the agents' purported characteristics and the interaction effect of participants' genders and purported characteristics. We also analyzed human response patterns, including game completion time, proactive favorable behavior, and acceptance of repair efforts. These insights offer a new perspective on human interactions with LLM agents in competitive cooperation contexts, such as virtual avatars or future physical entities. The study underscores the importance of understanding human biases toward AI agents and how observed behaviors can influence future human-AI cooperation dynamics.

# Self-Corrective Task Planning by Inverse Prompting with Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Jiho Lee, Hayun Lee, Jonghyeon Kim, Kyungjae Lee, Eunwoo Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07317)  

**Abstract**: In robot task planning, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in generating complex and long-horizon action sequences. However, it is observed that LLMs often produce responses that sound plausible but are not accurate. To address these problems, existing methods typically employ predefined error sets or external knowledge sources, requiring human efforts and computation resources. Recently, self-correction approaches have emerged, where LLM generates and refines plans, identifying errors by itself. Despite their effectiveness, they are more prone to failures in correction due to insufficient reasoning. In this paper, we introduce InversePrompt, a novel self-corrective task planning approach that leverages inverse prompting to enhance interpretability. Our method incorporates reasoning steps to provide clear, interpretable feedback. It generates inverse actions corresponding to the initially generated actions and verifies whether these inverse actions can restore the system to its original state, explicitly validating the logical coherence of the generated this http URL results on benchmark datasets show an average 16.3% higher success rate over existing LLM-based task planning methods. Our approach offers clearer justifications for feedback in real-world environments, resulting in more successful task completion than existing self-correction approaches across various scenarios.

# Group-robust Sample Reweighting for Subpopulation Shifts via Influence Functions 

**Authors**: Rui Qiao, Zhaoxuan Wu, Jingtan Wang, Pang Wei Koh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07315)  

**Abstract**: Machine learning models often have uneven performance among subpopulations (a.k.a., groups) in the data distributions. This poses a significant challenge for the models to generalize when the proportions of the groups shift during deployment. To improve robustness to such shifts, existing approaches have developed strategies that train models or perform hyperparameter tuning using the group-labeled data to minimize the worst-case loss over groups. However, a non-trivial amount of high-quality labels is often required to obtain noticeable improvements. Given the costliness of the labels, we propose to adopt a different paradigm to enhance group label efficiency: utilizing the group-labeled data as a target set to optimize the weights of other group-unlabeled data. We introduce Group-robust Sample Reweighting (GSR), a two-stage approach that first learns the representations from group-unlabeled data, and then tinkers the model by iteratively retraining its last layer on the reweighted data using influence functions. Our GSR is theoretically sound, practically lightweight, and effective in improving the robustness to subpopulation shifts. In particular, GSR outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches that require the same amount or even more group labels.

# Distilling Knowledge into Quantum Vision Transformers for Biomedical Image Classification 

**Authors**: Thomas Boucher, Evangelos B. Mazomenos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07294)  

**Abstract**: Quantum vision transformers (QViTs) build on vision transformers (ViTs) by replacing linear layers within the self-attention mechanism with parameterised quantum neural networks (QNNs), harnessing quantum mechanical properties to improve feature representation. This hybrid approach aims to achieve superior performance, with significantly reduced model complexity as a result of the enriched feature representation, requiring fewer parameters. This paper proposes a novel QViT model for biomedical image classification and investigates its performance against comparable ViTs across eight diverse datasets, encompassing various modalities and classification tasks. We assess models trained from scratch and those pre-trained using knowledge distillation (KD) from high-quality teacher models. Our findings demonstrate that QViTs outperform comparable ViTs with average ROC AUC (0.863 vs 0.846) and accuracy (0.710 vs 0.687) when trained from scratch, and even compete with state-of-the-art classical models in multiple tasks, whilst being significantly more efficient (89% reduction in GFLOPs and 99.99% in parameter number). Additionally, we find that QViTs and ViTs respond equally well to KD, with QViT pre-training performance scaling with model complexity. This is the first investigation into the efficacy of deploying QViTs with KD for computer-aided diagnosis. Our results highlight the enormous potential of quantum machine learning (QML) in biomedical image analysis.

# VizTrust: A Visual Analytics Tool for Capturing User Trust Dynamics in Human-AI Communication 

**Authors**: Xin Wang, Stephanie Tulk Jesso, Sadamori Kojaku, David M Neyens, Min Sun Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07279)  

**Abstract**: Trust plays a fundamental role in shaping the willingness of users to engage and collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, measuring user trust remains challenging due to its complex and dynamic nature. While traditional survey methods provide trust levels for long conversations, they fail to capture its dynamic evolution during ongoing interactions. Here, we present VizTrust, which addresses this challenge by introducing a real-time visual analytics tool that leverages a multi-agent collaboration system to capture and analyze user trust dynamics in human-agent communication. Built on established human-computer trust scales-competence, integrity, benevolence, and predictability-, VizTrust enables stakeholders to observe trust formation as it happens, identify patterns in trust development, and pinpoint specific interaction elements that influence trust. Our tool offers actionable insights into human-agent trust formation and evolution in real time through a dashboard, supporting the design of adaptive conversational agents that responds effectively to user trust signals.

# Federated Learning in NTNs: Design, Architecture and Challenges 

**Authors**: Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07272)  

**Abstract**: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.

**Authors**: Yuwei Niu, Munan Ning, Mengren Zheng, Bin Lin, Peng Jin, Jiaqi Liao, Kunpeng Ning, Bin Zhu, Li Yuan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07265)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-Image (T2I) models are capable of generating high-quality artistic creations and visual content. However, existing research and evaluation standards predominantly focus on image realism and shallow text-image alignment, lacking a comprehensive assessment of complex semantic understanding and world knowledge integration in text to image generation. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{WISE}$, the first benchmark specifically designed for $\textbf{W}$orld Knowledge-$\textbf{I}$nformed $\textbf{S}$emantic $\textbf{E}$valuation. WISE moves beyond simple word-pixel mapping by challenging models with 1000 meticulously crafted prompts across 25 sub-domains in cultural common sense, spatio-temporal reasoning, and natural science. To overcome the limitations of traditional CLIP metric, we introduce $\textbf{WiScore}$, a novel quantitative metric for assessing knowledge-image alignment. Through comprehensive testing of 20 models (10 dedicated T2I models and 10 unified multimodal models) using 1,000 structured prompts spanning 25 subdomains, our findings reveal significant limitations in their ability to effectively integrate and apply world knowledge during image generation, highlighting critical pathways for enhancing knowledge incorporation and application in next-generation T2I models.

# COMODO: Cross-Modal Video-to-IMU Distillation for Efficient Egocentric Human Activity Recognition 

**Authors**: Baiyu Chen, Wilson Wongso, Zechen Li, Yonchanok Khaokaew, Hao Xue, Flora Salim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07259)  

**Abstract**: Egocentric video-based models capture rich semantic information and have demonstrated strong performance in human activity recognition (HAR). However, their high power consumption, privacy concerns, and dependence on lighting conditions limit their feasibility for continuous on-device recognition. In contrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and privacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale annotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation framework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the IMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a pretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue, aligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings. By distilling knowledge from video representations, our approach enables the IMU encoder to inherit rich semantic information from video while preserving its efficiency for real-world applications. Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets demonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification performance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised fine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization. Benefiting from its simplicity, our method is also generally applicable to various video and time-series pre-trained models, offering the potential to leverage more powerful teacher and student foundation models in future research. The code is available at this https URL .

**Authors**: Xinyu Nan, Meng He, Zifan Chen, Bin Dong, Lei Tang, Li Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07248)  

**Abstract**: The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers remains significantly high, particularly in China, emphasizing the importance of accurate prognostic assessments and effective treatment strategies. Research shows a strong correlation between abdominal muscle and fat tissue composition and patient outcomes. However, existing manual methods for analyzing abdominal tissue composition are time-consuming and costly, limiting clinical research scalability. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-driven tool for automated analysis of abdominal CT scans to effectively identify and segment muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. Our tool integrates a multi-view localization model and a high-precision 2D nnUNet-based segmentation model, demonstrating a localization accuracy of 90% and a Dice Score Coefficient of 0.967 for segmentation. Furthermore, it features an interactive interface that allows clinicians to refine the segmentation results, ensuring high-quality outcomes effectively. Our tool offers a standardized method for effectively extracting critical abdominal tissues, potentially enhancing the management and treatment for gastrointestinal cancers.

# LLM-C3MOD: A Human-LLM Collaborative System for Cross-Cultural Hate Speech Moderation 

**Authors**: Junyeong Park, Seogyeong Jeong, Seyoung Song, Yohan Lee, Alice Oh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07237)  

**Abstract**: Content moderation is a global challenge, yet major tech platforms prioritize high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages with scarce native moderators. Since effective moderation depends on understanding contextual cues, this imbalance increases the risk of improper moderation due to non-native moderators' limited cultural understanding. Through a user study, we identify that non-native moderators struggle with interpreting culturally-specific knowledge, sentiment, and internet culture in the hate speech moderation. To assist them, we present LLM-C3MOD, a human-LLM collaborative pipeline with three steps: (1) RAG-enhanced cultural context annotations; (2) initial LLM-based moderation; and (3) targeted human moderation for cases lacking LLM consensus. Evaluated on a Korean hate speech dataset with Indonesian and German participants, our system achieves 78% accuracy (surpassing GPT-4o's 71% baseline), while reducing human workload by 83.6%. Notably, human moderators excel at nuanced contents where LLMs struggle. Our findings suggest that non-native moderators, when properly supported by LLMs, can effectively contribute to cross-cultural hate speech moderation.

**Authors**: Haicheng Liao, Hanlin Kong, Bonan Wang, Chengyue Wang, Wang Ye, Zhengbing He, Chengzhong Xu, Zhenning Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07234)  

**Abstract**: Accurate motion forecasting is crucial for safe autonomous driving (AD). This study proposes CoT-Drive, a novel approach that enhances motion forecasting by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and a chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting method. We introduce a teacher-student knowledge distillation strategy to effectively transfer LLMs' advanced scene understanding capabilities to lightweight language models (LMs), ensuring that CoT-Drive operates in real-time on edge devices while maintaining comprehensive scene understanding and generalization capabilities. By leveraging CoT prompting techniques for LLMs without additional training, CoT-Drive generates semantic annotations that significantly improve the understanding of complex traffic environments, thereby boosting the accuracy and robustness of predictions. Additionally, we present two new scene description datasets, Highway-Text and Urban-Text, designed for fine-tuning lightweight LMs to generate context-specific semantic annotations. Comprehensive evaluations of five real-world datasets demonstrate that CoT-Drive outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness and efficiency in handling complex traffic scenarios. Overall, this study is the first to consider the practical application of LLMs in this field. It pioneers the training and use of a lightweight LLM surrogate for motion forecasting, setting a new benchmark and showcasing the potential of integrating LLMs into AD systems.

# Cross-Lingual IPA Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot NER 

**Authors**: Jimin Sohn, David R. Mortensen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07214)  

**Abstract**: Existing approaches to zero-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) for low-resource languages have primarily relied on machine translation, whereas more recent methods have shifted focus to phonemic representation. Building upon this, we investigate how reducing the phonemic representation gap in IPA transcription between languages with similar phonetic characteristics enables models trained on high-resource languages to perform effectively on low-resource languages. In this work, we propose CONtrastive Learning with IPA (CONLIPA) dataset containing 10 English and high resource languages IPA pairs from 10 frequently used language families. We also propose a cross-lingual IPA Contrastive learning method (IPAC) using the CONLIPA dataset. Furthermore, our proposed dataset and methodology demonstrate a substantial average gain when compared to the best performing baseline.

# Discrete Gaussian Process Representations for Optimising UAV-based Precision Weed Mapping 

**Authors**: Jacob Swindell, Madeleine Darbyshire, Marija Popovic, Riccardo Polvara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07210)  

**Abstract**: Accurate agricultural weed mapping using UAVs is crucial for precision farming applications. Traditional methods rely on orthomosaic stitching from rigid flight paths, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming. Gaussian Process (GP)-based mapping offers continuous modelling of the underlying variable (i.e. weed distribution) but requires discretisation for practical tasks like path planning or visualisation. Current implementations often default to quadtrees or gridmaps without systematically evaluating alternatives. This study compares five discretisation methods: quadtrees, wedgelets, top-down binary space partition (BSP) trees using least square error (LSE), bottom-up BSP trees using graph merging, and variable-resolution hexagonal grids. Evaluations on real-world weed distributions measure visual similarity, mean squared error (MSE), and computational efficiency. Results show quadtrees perform best overall, but alternatives excel in specific scenarios: hexagons or BSP LSE suit fields with large, dominant weed patches, while quadtrees are optimal for dispersed small-scale distributions. These findings highlight the need to tailor discretisation approaches to weed distribution patterns (patch size, density, coverage) rather than relying on default methods. By choosing representations based on the underlying distribution, we can improve mapping accuracy and efficiency for precision agriculture applications.

# DeFine: A Decomposed and Fine-Grained Annotated Dataset for Long-form Article Generation 

**Authors**: Ming Wang, Fang Wang, Minghao Hu, Li He, Haiyang Wang, Jun Zhang, Tianwei Yan, Li Li, Zhunchen Luo, Wei Luo, Xiaoying Bai, Guotong Geng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07170)  

**Abstract**: Long-form article generation (LFAG) presents challenges such as maintaining logical consistency, comprehensive topic coverage, and narrative coherence across extended articles. Existing datasets often lack both the hierarchical structure and fine-grained annotation needed to effectively decompose tasks, resulting in shallow, disorganized article generation. To address these limitations, we introduce DeFine, a Decomposed and Fine-grained annotated dataset for long-form article generation. DeFine is characterized by its hierarchical decomposition strategy and the integration of domain-specific knowledge with multi-level annotations, ensuring granular control and enhanced depth in article generation. To construct the dataset, a multi-agent collaborative pipeline is proposed, which systematically segments the generation process into four parts: Data Miner, Cite Retreiver, Q&A Annotator and Data Cleaner. To validate the effectiveness of DeFine, we designed and tested three LFAG baselines: the web retrieval, the local retrieval, and the grounded reference. We fine-tuned the Qwen2-7b-Instruct model using the DeFine training dataset. The experimental results showed significant improvements in text quality, specifically in topic coverage, depth of information, and content fidelity. Our dataset publicly available to facilitate future research.

# Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms 

**Authors**: Jiaming Song, Linqi Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07154)  

**Abstract**: Recent years have seen significant advancements in foundation models through generative pre-training, yet algorithmic innovation in this space has largely stagnated around autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation creates a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence. We argue that an inference-first perspective, which prioritizes scaling efficiency during inference time across sequence length and refinement steps, can inspire novel generative pre-training algorithms. Using Inductive Moment Matching (IMM) as a concrete example, we demonstrate how addressing limitations in diffusion models' inference process through targeted modifications yields a stable, single-stage algorithm that achieves superior sample quality with over an order of magnitude greater inference efficiency.

# PTMs-TSCIL Pre-Trained Models Based Class-Incremental Learning 

**Authors**: Yuanlong Wu, Mingxing Nie, Tao Zhu, Liming Chen, Huansheng Ning, Yaping Wan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07153)  

**Abstract**: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for time series data faces critical challenges in balancing stability against catastrophic forgetting and plasticity for new knowledge acquisition, particularly under real-world constraints where historical data access is restricted. While pre-trained models (PTMs) have shown promise in CIL for vision and NLP domains, their potential in time series class-incremental learning (TSCIL) remains underexplored due to the scarcity of large-scale time series pre-trained models. Prompted by the recent emergence of large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) for time series data, we present the first exploration of PTM-based Time Series Class-Incremental Learning (TSCIL). Our approach leverages frozen PTM backbones coupled with incrementally tuning the shared adapter, preserving generalization capabilities while mitigating feature drift through knowledge distillation. Furthermore, we introduce a Feature Drift Compensation Network (DCN), designed with a novel two-stage training strategy to precisely model feature space transformations across incremental tasks. This allows for accurate projection of old class prototypes into the new feature space. By employing DCN-corrected prototypes, we effectively enhance the unified classifier retraining, mitigating model feature drift and alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our method yielding final accuracy gains of 1.4%-6.1% across all datasets compared to existing PTM-based approaches. Our work establishes a new paradigm for TSCIL, providing insights into stability-plasticity optimization for continual learning systems.

# MRCEval: A Comprehensive, Challenging and Accessible Machine Reading Comprehension Benchmark 

**Authors**: Shengkun Ma, Hao Peng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07144)  

**Abstract**: Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an essential task in evaluating natural language understanding. Existing MRC datasets primarily assess specific aspects of reading comprehension (RC), lacking a comprehensive MRC benchmark. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes the key capabilities required for RC. Based on this taxonomy, we construct MRCEval, an MRC benchmark that leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) as both sample generators and selection judges. MRCEval is a comprehensive, challenging and accessible benchmark designed to assess the RC capabilities of LLMs thoroughly, covering 13 distinct RC skills with a total of 2.1K high-quality multi-choice questions. We perform an extensive evaluation of 28 widely used open-source and proprietary models, highlighting that MRC continues to present significant challenges even in the era of LLMs.

# A Comprehensive Survey of Mixture-of-Experts: Algorithms, Theory, and Applications 

**Authors**: Siyuan Mu, Sen Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07137)  

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved astonishing successes in many domains, especially with the recent breakthroughs in the development of foundational large models. These large models, leveraging their extensive training data, provide versatile solutions for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, as modern datasets become increasingly diverse and complex, the development of large AI models faces two major challenges: (1) the enormous consumption of computational resources and deployment difficulties, and (2) the difficulty in fitting heterogeneous and complex data, which limits the usability of the models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models has recently attracted much attention in addressing these challenges, by dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant sub-models to process input data. It has been shown that MoEs can significantly improve model performance and efficiency with fewer resources, particularly excelling in handling large-scale, multimodal data. Given the tremendous potential MoE has demonstrated across various domains, it is urgent to provide a comprehensive summary of recent advancements of MoEs in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE have their limitations, e.g., being outdated or lacking discussion on certain key areas, and we aim to address these gaps. In this paper, we first introduce the basic design of MoE, including gating functions, expert networks, routing mechanisms, training strategies, and system design. We then explore the algorithm design of MoE in important machine learning paradigms such as continual learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, and reinforcement learning. Additionally, we summarize theoretical studies aimed at understanding MoE and review its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions.

**Authors**: Deuksin Kwon, Jiwon Hae, Emma Clift, Daniel Shamsoddini, Jonathan Gratch, Gale M. Lucas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07129)  

**Abstract**: Negotiation requires dynamically balancing self-interest and cooperation to maximize one's own utility. Yet, existing agents struggle due to bounded rationality in human data, low adaptability to counterpart behavior, and limited strategic reasoning. To address this, we introduce principle-driven negotiation agents, powered by ASTRA, a novel framework for turn-level offer optimization grounded in two core principles: opponent modeling and Tit-for-Tat reciprocity. ASTRA operates in three stages: (1) interpreting counterpart behavior, (2) optimizing counteroffers via a linear programming (LP) solver, and (3) selecting offers based on negotiation tactics and the partner's acceptance probability. Through simulations and human evaluations, our agent effectively adapts to an opponent's shifting stance and achieves favorable outcomes through enhanced adaptability and strategic reasoning. Beyond improving negotiation performance, it also serves as a powerful coaching tool, offering interpretable strategic feedback and optimal offer recommendations.

**Authors**: Chaoran E, Chenghan Chen, Yuyang Shi, Haiyun Wang, Peixin Hua, Xiwen Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07110)  

**Abstract**: Methods: A method of the pulsation for a pVAD is proposed (AP-pVAD Model). AP-pVAD Model consists of two parts: NPQ Model and LSTM-Transformer Model. (1)The NPQ Model determines the mathematical relationship between motor speed, pressure, and flow rate for the pVAD. (2)The Attention module of Transformer neural network is integrated into the LSTM neural network to form the new LSTM-Transformer Model to predict the pulsation time characteristic points for adjusting the motor speed of the pVAD. Results: The AP-pVAD Model is validated in three hydraulic experiments and an animal experiment. (1)The pressure provided by pVAD calculated with the NPQ Model has a maximum error of only 2.15 mmHg compared to the expected values. (2)The pulsation time characteristic points predicted by the LSTM-Transformer Model shows a maximum prediction error of 1.78ms, which is significantly lower than other methods. (3)The in-vivo test of pVAD in animal experiment has significant improvements in aortic pressure. Animals survive for over 27 hours after the initiation of pVAD operation. Conclusion: (1)For a given pVAD, motor speed has a linear relationship with pressure and a quadratic relationship with flow. (2)Deep learning can be used to predict pulsation characteristic time points, with the LSTM-Transformer Model demonstrating minimal prediction error and better robust performance under conditions of limited dataset sizes, elevated noise levels, and diverse hyperparameter combinations, demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.

**Authors**: Shuhe Wang, Xiaoya Li, Jiwei Li, Guoyin Wang, Xiaofei Sun, Bob Zhu, Han Qiu, Mo Yu, Shengjie Shen, Eduard Hovy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07091)  

**Abstract**: Due to the data-driven nature of current face identity (FaceID) customization methods, all state-of-the-art models rely on large-scale datasets containing millions of high-quality text-image pairs for training. However, none of these datasets are publicly available, which restricts transparency and hinders further advancements in the field.
To address this issue, in this paper, we collect and release FaceID-6M, the first large-scale, open-source FaceID dataset containing 6 million high-quality text-image pairs. Filtered from LAION-5B \cite{schuhmann2022laion}, FaceID-6M undergoes a rigorous image and text filtering steps to ensure dataset quality, including resolution filtering to maintain high-quality images and faces, face filtering to remove images that lack human faces, and keyword-based strategy to retain descriptions containing human-related terms (e.g., nationality, professions and names). Through these cleaning processes, FaceID-6M provides a high-quality dataset optimized for training powerful FaceID customization models, facilitating advancements in the field by offering an open resource for research and development.
We conduct extensive experiments to show the effectiveness of our FaceID-6M, demonstrating that models trained on our FaceID-6M dataset achieve performance that is comparable to, and slightly better than currently available industrial models. Additionally, to support and advance research in the FaceID customization community, we make our code, datasets, and models fully publicly available. Our codes, models, and datasets are available at: this https URL.

**Authors**: Spyros Kondylatos, Nikolaos Ioannis Bountos, Dimitrios Michail, Xiao Xiang Zhu, Gustau Camps-Valls, Ioannis Papoutsis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07082)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in Computer Vision have introduced the concept of pretrained representation uncertainty, enabling zero-shot uncertainty estimation. This holds significant potential for Earth Observation (EO), where trustworthiness is critical, yet the complexity of EO data poses challenges to uncertainty-aware methods. In this work, we investigate the generalization of representation uncertainty in EO, considering the domain's unique semantic characteristics. We pretrain uncertainties on large EO datasets and propose an evaluation framework to assess their zero-shot performance in multi-label classification and segmentation EO tasks. Our findings reveal that, unlike uncertainties pretrained on natural images, EO-pretraining exhibits strong generalization across unseen EO domains, geographic locations, and target granularities, while maintaining sensitivity to variations in ground sampling distance. We demonstrate the practical utility of pretrained uncertainties showcasing their alignment with task-specific uncertainties in downstream tasks, their sensitivity to real-world EO image noise, and their ability to generate spatial uncertainty estimates out-of-the-box. Initiating the discussion on representation uncertainty in EO, our study provides insights into its strengths and limitations, paving the way for future research in the field. Code and weights are available at: this https URL.

# An Experience Report on Regression-Free Repair of Deep Neural Network Model 

**Authors**: Takao Nakagawa, Susumu Tokumoto, Shogo Tokui, Fuyuki Ishikawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07079)  

**Abstract**: Systems based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in industry. In the process of system operation, DNNs need to be updated in order to improve their performance. When updating DNNs, systems used in companies that require high reliability must have as few regressions as possible. Since the update of DNNs has a data-driven nature, it is difficult to suppress regressions as expected by developers. This paper identifies the requirements for DNN updating in industry and presents a case study using techniques to meet those requirements. In the case study, we worked on satisfying the requirement to update models trained on car images collected in Fujitsu assuming security applications without regression for a specific class. We were able to suppress regression by customizing the objective function based on NeuRecover, a DNN repair technique. Moreover, we discuss some of the challenges identified in the case study.

# NFIG: Autoregressive Image Generation with Next-Frequency Prediction 

**Authors**: Zhihao Huang, Xi Qiu, Yukuo Ma, Yifu Zhou, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07076)  

**Abstract**: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

# PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems 

**Authors**: Apivich Hemachandra, Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07070)  

**Abstract**: In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing PDEs, and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional.

# DistiLLM-2: A Contrastive Approach Boosts the Distillation of LLMs 

**Authors**: Jongwoo Ko, Tianyi Chen, Sungnyun Kim, Tianyu Ding, Luming Liang, Ilya Zharkov, Se-Young Yun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07067)  

**Abstract**: Despite the success of distillation in large language models (LLMs), most prior work applies identical loss functions to both teacher- and student-generated data. These strategies overlook the synergy between loss formulations and data types, leading to a suboptimal performance boost in student models. To address this, we propose DistiLLM-2, a contrastive approach that simultaneously increases the likelihood of teacher responses and decreases that of student responses by harnessing this synergy. Our extensive experiments show that DistiLLM-2 not only builds high-performing student models across a wide range of tasks, including instruction-following and code generation, but also supports diverse applications, such as preference alignment and vision-language extensions. These findings highlight the potential of a contrastive approach to enhance the efficacy of LLM distillation by effectively aligning teacher and student models across varied data types.

# Generative method for aerodynamic optimization based on classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model 

**Authors**: Shisong Deng, Qiang Zhang, Zhengyang Cai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07056)  

**Abstract**: Inverse design approach, which directly generates optimal aerodynamic shape with neural network models to meet designated performance targets, has drawn enormous attention. However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design approach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network, demonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes and struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance indicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based on the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM) is proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively capture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by adjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper and lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated pressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into airfoil geometries through a mapping model. Experimental results using classical transonic airfoils as examples show that the inverse design based on CDDPM can generate a variety of pressure coefficient distributions, which enriches the diversity of design results. Compared with current state-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM achieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a practical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based on global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy, aiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the inverse design framework. This work is not only suitable for the airfoils design, but also has the capability to apply to optimization process of general product parts targeting selected performance indicators.

# TIDE : Temporal-Aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion Transformers in Image Generation 

**Authors**: Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Le Zhuo, Yi Xin, Zhaokai Wang, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07050)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are a powerful yet underexplored class of generative models compared to U-Net-based diffusion models. To bridge this gap, we introduce TIDE (Temporal-aware Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretable Diffusion transformErs), a novel framework that enhances temporal reconstruction within DiT activation layers across denoising steps. TIDE employs Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) with a sparse bottleneck layer to extract interpretable and hierarchical features, revealing that diffusion models inherently learn hierarchical features at multiple levels (e.g., 3D, semantic, class) during generative pre-training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 1e-3 and a cosine similarity of 0.97, demonstrating superior accuracy in capturing activation dynamics along the denoising trajectory. Beyond interpretability, we showcase TIDE's potential in downstream applications such as sparse activation-guided image editing and style transfer, enabling improved controllability for generative systems. By providing a comprehensive training and evaluation protocol tailored for DiTs, TIDE contributes to developing more interpretable, transparent, and trustworthy generative models.

# DatawiseAgent: A Notebook-Centric LLM Agent Framework for Automated Data Science 

**Authors**: Ziming You, Yumiao Zhang, Dexuan Xu, Yiwei Lou, Yandong Yan, Wei Wang, Huaming Zhang, Yu Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07044)  

**Abstract**: Data Science tasks are multifaceted, dynamic, and often domain-specific. Existing LLM-based approaches largely concentrate on isolated phases, neglecting the interdependent nature of many data science tasks and limiting their capacity for comprehensive end-to-end support. We propose DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework that unifies interactions among user, agent and the computational environment through markdown and executable code cells, supporting flexible and adaptive automated data science. Built on a Finite State Transducer(FST), DatawiseAgent orchestrates four stages, including DSF-like planning, incremental execution, self-debugging, and post-filtering. Specifically, the DFS-like planning stage systematically explores the solution space, while incremental execution harnesses real-time feedback and accommodates LLM's limited capabilities to progressively complete tasks. The self-debugging and post-filtering modules further enhance reliability by diagnosing and correcting errors and pruning extraneous information. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including data analysis, visualization, and data modeling, show that DatawiseAgent consistently outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods across multiple model settings. These results highlight its potential to generalize across data science scenarios and lay the groundwork for more efficient, fully automated workflows.

**Authors**: Nardine Basta, Conor Atkins, Dali Kaafar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07036)  

**Abstract**: We present "Bot Wars," a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs) scam-baiters to counter phone scams through simulated adversarial dialogues. Our key contribution is a formal foundation for strategy emergence through chain-of-thought reasoning without explicit optimization. Through a novel two-layer prompt architecture, our framework enables LLMs to craft demographically authentic victim personas while maintaining strategic coherence. We evaluate our approach using a dataset of 3,200 scam dialogues validated against 179 hours of human scam-baiting interactions, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex adversarial dynamics. Our systematic evaluation through cognitive, quantitative, and content-specific metrics shows that GPT-4 excels in dialogue naturalness and persona authenticity, while Deepseek demonstrates superior engagement sustainability.

# Availability-aware Sensor Fusion via Unified Canonical Space for 4D Radar, LiDAR, and Camera 

**Authors**: Dong-Hee Paek, Seung-Hyun Kong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07029)  

**Abstract**: Sensor fusion of camera, LiDAR, and 4-dimensional (4D) Radar has brought a significant performance improvement in autonomous driving (AD). However, there still exist fundamental challenges: deeply coupled fusion methods assume continuous sensor availability, making them vulnerable to sensor degradation and failure, whereas sensor-wise cross-attention fusion methods struggle with computational cost and unified feature representation. This paper presents availability-aware sensor fusion (ASF), a novel method that employs unified canonical projection (UCP) to enable consistency in all sensor features for fusion and cross-attention across sensors along patches (CASAP) to enhance robustness of sensor fusion against sensor degradation and failure. As a result, the proposed ASF shows a superior object detection performance to the existing state-of-the-art fusion methods under various weather and sensor degradation (or failure) conditions; Extensive experiments on the K-Radar dataset demonstrate that ASF achieves improvements of 9.7% in AP BEV (87.2%) and 20.1% in AP 3D (73.6%) in object detection at IoU=0.5, while requiring a low computational cost. The code will be available at this https URL.

# Erase Diffusion: Empowering Object Removal Through Calibrating Diffusion Pathways 

**Authors**: Yi Liu, Hao Zhou, Wenxiang Shang, Ran Lin, Benlei Cui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07026)  

**Abstract**: Erase inpainting, or object removal, aims to precisely remove target objects within masked regions while preserving the overall consistency of the surrounding content. Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant strides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the emergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact diffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms constrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the potential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In contrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization paradigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the erasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO) paradigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with the objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion transition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during optimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object removal. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the sampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention (SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering self-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts while further enhancing the coherence of the generated content. With this design, our proposed EraDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages V5 dataset and demonstrates significant superiority in real-world scenarios.

**Authors**: Sriram Vasudevan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07025)  

**Abstract**: Labeled datasets are essential for modern search engines, which increasingly rely on supervised learning methods like Learning to Rank and massive amounts of data to power deep learning models. However, creating these datasets is both time-consuming and costly, leading to the common use of user click and activity logs as proxies for relevance. In this paper, we present a weak supervision approach to infer the quality of query-document pairs and apply it within a Learning to Rank framework to enhance the precision of a large-scale search system.

# Combating Partial Perception Deficit in Autonomous Driving with Multimodal LLM Commonsense 

**Authors**: Yuting Hu, Chenhui Xu, Ruiyang Qin, Dancheng Liu, Amir Nassereldine, Yiyu Shi, Jinjun Xiong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07020)  

**Abstract**: Partial perception deficits can compromise autonomous vehicle safety by disrupting environmental understanding. Current protocols typically respond with immediate stops or minimal-risk maneuvers, worsening traffic flow and lacking flexibility for rare driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose LLM-RCO, a framework leveraging large language models to integrate human-like driving commonsense into autonomous systems facing perception deficits. LLM-RCO features four key modules: hazard inference, short-term motion planner, action condition verifier, and safety constraint generator. These modules interact with the dynamic driving environment, enabling proactive and context-aware control actions to override the original control policy of autonomous agents. To improve safety in such challenging conditions, we construct DriveLM-Deficit, a dataset of 53,895 video clips featuring deficits of safety-critical objects, complete with annotations for LLM-based hazard inference and motion planning fine-tuning. Extensive experiments in adverse driving conditions with the CARLA simulator demonstrate that systems equipped with LLM-RCO significantly improve driving performance, highlighting its potential for enhancing autonomous driving resilience against adverse perception deficits. Our results also show that LLMs fine-tuned with DriveLM-Deficit can enable more proactive movements instead of conservative stops in the context of perception deficits.

# NukesFormers: Unpaired Hyperspectral Image Generation with Non-Uniform Domain Alignment 

**Authors**: Jiaojiao Li, Shiyao Duan, Haitao XU, Rui Song  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07004)  

**Abstract**: The inherent difficulty in acquiring accurately co-registered RGB-hyperspectral image (HSI) pairs has significantly impeded the practical deployment of current data-driven Hyperspectral Image Generation (HIG) networks in engineering applications. Gleichzeitig, the ill-posed nature of the aligning constraints, compounded with the complexities of mining cross-domain features, also hinders the advancement of unpaired HIG (UnHIG) tasks. In this paper, we conquer these challenges by modeling the UnHIG to range space interaction and compensations of null space through Range-Null Space Decomposition (RND) methodology. Specifically, the introduced contrastive learning effectively aligns the geometric and spectral distributions of unpaired data by building the interaction of range space, considering the consistent feature in degradation process. Following this, we map the frequency representations of dual-domain input and thoroughly mining the null space, like degraded and high-frequency components, through the proposed Non-uniform Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Extensive comparative experiments demonstrate that it establishes a new benchmark in UnHIG.

# Social Bias Benchmark for Generation: A Comparison of Generation and QA-Based Evaluations 

**Authors**: Jiho Jin, Woosung Kang, Junho Myung, Alice Oh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06987)  

**Abstract**: Measuring social bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but existing bias evaluation methods struggle to assess bias in long-form generation. We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.

# Understanding the Learning Dynamics of LoRA: A Gradient Flow Perspective on Low-Rank Adaptation in Matrix Factorization 

**Authors**: Ziqing Xu, Hancheng Min, Lachlan Ewen MacDonald, Jinqi Luo, Salma Tarmoun, Enrique Mallada, Rene Vidal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06982)  

**Abstract**: Despite the empirical success of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning pre-trained models, there is little theoretical understanding of how first-order methods with carefully crafted initialization adapt models to new tasks. In this work, we take the first step towards bridging this gap by theoretically analyzing the learning dynamics of LoRA for matrix factorization (MF) under gradient flow (GF), emphasizing the crucial role of initialization. For small initialization, we theoretically show that GF converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution, with smaller initialization leading to lower final error. Our analysis shows that the final error is affected by the misalignment between the singular spaces of the pre-trained model and the target matrix, and reducing the initialization scale improves alignment. To address this misalignment, we propose a spectral initialization for LoRA in MF and theoretically prove that GF with small spectral initialization converges to the fine-tuning task with arbitrary precision. Numerical experiments from MF and image classification validate our findings.

# Lightweight Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition 

**Authors**: Xinyu Xi, Hua Yang, Shentai Zhang, Yijie Liu, Sijin Sun, Xiuju Fu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06978)  

**Abstract**: Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of intelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine conservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this task presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where marine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes, which requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models alone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that integrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors generated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer semantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs an efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness and adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show that our model achieves 98$\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by 3.5$\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing the model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\%$ accuracy drop while significantly lowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution for real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in resource-limited settings.

# A Multimodal Benchmark Dataset and Model for Crop Disease Diagnosis 

**Authors**: Xiang Liu, Zhaoxiang Liu, Huan Hu, Zezhou Chen, Kohou Wang, Kai Wang, Shiguo Lian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06973)  

**Abstract**: While conversational generative AI has shown considerable potential in enhancing decision-making for agricultural professionals, its exploration has predominantly been anchored in text-based interactions. The evolution of multimodal conversational AI, leveraging vast amounts of image-text data from diverse sources, marks a significant stride forward. However, the application of such advanced vision-language models in the agricultural domain, particularly for crop disease diagnosis, remains underexplored. In this work, we present the crop disease domain multimodal (CDDM) dataset, a pioneering resource designed to advance the field of agricultural research through the application of multimodal learning techniques. The dataset comprises 137,000 images of various crop diseases, accompanied by 1 million question-answer pairs that span a broad spectrum of agricultural knowledge, from disease identification to management practices. By integrating visual and textual data, CDDM facilitates the development of sophisticated question-answering systems capable of providing precise, useful advice to farmers and agricultural professionals. We demonstrate the utility of the dataset by finetuning state-of-the-art multimodal models, showcasing significant improvements in crop disease diagnosis. Specifically, we employed a novel finetuning strategy that utilizes low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the visual encoder, adapter and language model simultaneously. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a finetuning strategy and a benchmark to stimulate further research in agricultural technology, aiming to bridge the gap between advanced AI techniques and practical agricultural applications. The dataset is available at https: //github.com/UnicomAI/UnicomBenchmark/tree/main/CDDMBench.

# Multi-Behavior Recommender Systems: A Survey 

**Authors**: Kyungho Kim, Sunwoo Kim, Geon Lee, Jinhong Jung, Kijung Shin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06963)  

**Abstract**: Traditional recommender systems primarily rely on a single type of user-item interaction, such as item purchases or ratings, to predict user preferences. However, in real-world scenarios, users engage in a variety of behaviors, such as clicking on items or adding them to carts, offering richer insights into their interests. Multi-behavior recommender systems leverage these diverse interactions to enhance recommendation quality, and research on this topic has grown rapidly in recent years. This survey provides a timely review of multi-behavior recommender systems, focusing on three key steps: (1) Data Modeling: representing multi-behaviors at the input level, (2) Encoding: transforming these inputs into vector representations (i.e., embeddings), and (3) Training: optimizing machine-learning models. We systematically categorize existing multi-behavior recommender systems based on the commonalities and differences in their approaches across the above steps. Additionally, we discuss promising future directions for advancing multi-behavior recommender systems.

# Capture Global Feature Statistics for One-Shot Federated Learning 

**Authors**: Zenghao Guan, Yucan Zhou, Xiaoyan Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06962)  

**Abstract**: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) necessitates numerous rounds of communication between the server and clients, posing significant challenges including high communication costs, connection drop risks and susceptibility to privacy attacks. One-shot FL has become a compelling learning paradigm to overcome above drawbacks by enabling the training of a global server model via a single communication round. However, existing one-shot FL methods suffer from expensive computation cost on the server or clients and cannot deal with non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data stably and effectively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes FedCGS, a novel Federated learning algorithm that Capture Global feature Statistics leveraging pre-trained models. With global feature statistics, we achieve training-free and heterogeneity-resistant one-shot FL. Furthermore, we extend its application to personalization scenario, where clients only need execute one extra communication round with server to download global statistics. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse data heterogeneity settings. Code is available at this https URL.

# Large Language Model Guided Progressive Feature Alignment for Multimodal UAV Object Detection 

**Authors**: Wentao Wu, Chenglong Li, Xiao Wang, Bin Luo, Qi Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06948)  

**Abstract**: Existing multimodal UAV object detection methods often overlook the impact of semantic gaps between modalities, which makes it difficult to achieve accurate semantic and spatial alignments, limiting detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) guided Progressive feature Alignment Network called LPANet, which leverages the semantic features extracted from a large language model to guide the progressive semantic and spatial alignment between modalities for multimodal UAV object detection. To employ the powerful semantic representation of LLM, we generate the fine-grained text descriptions of each object category by ChatGPT and then extract the semantic features using the large language model MPNet. Based on the semantic features, we guide the semantic and spatial alignments in a progressive manner as follows. First, we design the Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to pull the semantic features and multimodal visual features of each object closer, alleviating the semantic differences of objects between modalities. Second, we design the Explicit Spatial alignment Module (ESM) by integrating the semantic relations into the estimation of feature-level offsets, alleviating the coarse spatial misalignment between modalities. Finally, we design the Implicit Spatial alignment Module (ISM), which leverages the cross-modal correlations to aggregate key features from neighboring regions to achieve implicit spatial alignment. Comprehensive experiments on two public multimodal UAV object detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal UAV object detectors.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06926)  

**Abstract**: This paper investigates a critical aspect of large language model (LLM) performance: the optimal formatting of classification task options in prompts. Through an extensive experimental study, we compared two selection formats -- bullet points and plain English -- to determine their impact on model performance. Our findings suggest that presenting options via bullet points generally yields better results, although there are some exceptions. Furthermore, our research highlights the need for continued exploration of option formatting to drive further improvements in model performance.

# From Reusing to Forecasting: Accelerating Diffusion Models with TaylorSeers 

**Authors**: Jiacheng Liu, Chang Zou, Yuanhuiyi Lyu, Junjie Chen, Linfeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06923)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have revolutionized high-fidelity image and video synthesis, yet their computational demands remain prohibitive for real-time applications. To solve this problem, feature caching has been proposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous timesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at timesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion models decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors introduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To solve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of diffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at previous timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and continuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to approximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in future timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments demonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis, especially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost lossless acceleration of 4.99$\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\times$ on HunyuanVideo without additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with previous SOTA at $4.53$$\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the supplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

# Policy Regularization on Globally Accessible States in Cross-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Zhenghai Xue, Lang Feng, Jiacheng Xu, Kang Kang, Xiang Wen, Bo An, Shuicheng Yan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06893)  

**Abstract**: To learn from data collected in diverse dynamics, Imitation from Observation (IfO) methods leverage expert state trajectories based on the premise that recovering expert state distributions in other dynamics facilitates policy learning in the current one. However, Imitation Learning inherently imposes a performance upper bound of learned policies. Additionally, as the environment dynamics change, certain expert states may become inaccessible, rendering their distributions less valuable for imitation. To address this, we propose a novel framework that integrates reward maximization with IfO, employing F-distance regularized policy optimization. This framework enforces constraints on globally accessible states--those with nonzero visitation frequency across all considered dynamics--mitigating the challenge posed by inaccessible states. By instantiating F-distance in different ways, we derive two theoretical analysis and develop a practical algorithm called Accessible State Oriented Policy Regularization (ASOR). ASOR serves as a general add-on module that can be incorporated into various RL approaches, including offline RL and off-policy RL. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate ASOR's effectiveness in enhancing state-of-the-art cross-domain policy transfer algorithms, significantly improving their performance.

# Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Cannot Count, and Prompt Refinement Cannot Help 

**Authors**: Yuefan Cao, Xuyang Guo, Jiayan Huo, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang, Zhen Zhuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06884)  

**Abstract**: Generative modeling is widely regarded as one of the most essential problems in today's AI community, with text-to-image generation having gained unprecedented real-world impacts. Among various approaches, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success and have become the de facto solution for text-to-image generation. However, despite their impressive performance, these models exhibit fundamental limitations in adhering to numerical constraints in user instructions, frequently generating images with an incorrect number of objects. While several prior works have mentioned this issue, a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of this limitation remains lacking. To address this gap, we introduce T2ICountBench, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the counting ability of state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse set of generative models, including both open-source and private systems. It explicitly isolates counting performance from other capabilities, provides structured difficulty levels, and incorporates human evaluations to ensure high reliability.
Extensive evaluations with T2ICountBench reveal that all state-of-the-art diffusion models fail to generate the correct number of objects, with accuracy dropping significantly as the number of objects increases. Additionally, an exploratory study on prompt refinement demonstrates that such simple interventions generally do not improve counting accuracy. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges in numerical understanding within diffusion models and point to promising directions for future improvements.

# Interactive Medical Image Analysis with Concept-based Similarity Reasoning 

**Authors**: Ta Duc Huy, Sen Kim Tran, Phan Nguyen, Nguyen Hoang Tran, Tran Bao Sam, Anton van den Hengel, Zhibin Liao, Johan W. Verjans, Minh-Son To, Vu Minh Hieu Phan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06873)  

**Abstract**: The ability to interpret and intervene model decisions is important for the adoption of computer-aided diagnosis methods in clinical workflows. Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model. However, these concepts are at the image level, which hinders the model from pinpointing the exact patches the concepts are activated. Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.5\% across three biomedical datasets. Our code is released at this https URL.

# Lost-in-the-Middle in Long-Text Generation: Synthetic Dataset, Evaluation Framework, and Mitigation 

**Authors**: Junhao Zhang, Richong Zhang, Fanshuang Kong, Ziyang Miao, Yanhan Ye, Yaowei Zheng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06868)  

**Abstract**: Existing long-text generation methods primarily concentrate on producing lengthy texts from short inputs, neglecting the long-input and long-output tasks. Such tasks have numerous practical applications while lacking available benchmarks. Moreover, as the input grows in length, existing methods inevitably encounter the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. In this paper, we first introduce a Long Input and Output Benchmark (LongInOutBench), including a synthetic dataset and a comprehensive evaluation framework, addressing the challenge of the missing benchmark. We then develop the Retrieval-Augmented Long-Text Writer (RAL-Writer), which retrieves and restates important yet overlooked content, mitigating the "lost-in-the-middle" issue by constructing explicit prompts. We finally employ the proposed LongInOutBench to evaluate our RAL-Writer against comparable baselines, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code has been released at this https URL.

# Graphormer-Guided Task Planning: Beyond Static Rules with LLM Safety Perception 

**Authors**: Wanjing Huang, Tongjie Pan, Yalan Ye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06866)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role in robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating feasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains underdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception, making them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency hazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a Graphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based decision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a dynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk factors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike existing methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework introduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines safety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more flexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive safety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct experiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates improvements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task adaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static rule-based and LLM-only baselines.

# Enhanced Multi-Tuple Extraction for Alloys: Integrating Pointer Networks and Augmented Attention 

**Authors**: Mengzhe Hei, Zhouran Zhang, Qingbao Liu, Yan Pan, Xiang Zhao, Yongqian Peng, Yicong Ye, Xin Zhang, Shuxin Bai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06861)  

**Abstract**: Extracting high-quality structured information from scientific literature is crucial for advancing material design through data-driven methods. Despite the considerable research in natural language processing for dataset extraction, effective approaches for multi-tuple extraction in scientific literature remain scarce due to the complex interrelations of tuples and contextual ambiguities. In the study, we illustrate the multi-tuple extraction of mechanical properties from multi-principal-element alloys and presents a novel framework that combines an entity extraction model based on MatSciBERT with pointer networks and an allocation model utilizing inter- and intra-entity attention. Our rigorous experiments on tuple extraction demonstrate impressive F1 scores of 0.963, 0.947, 0.848, and 0.753 across datasets with 1, 2, 3, and 4 tuples, confirming the effectiveness of the model. Furthermore, an F1 score of 0.854 was achieved on a randomly curated dataset. These results highlight the model's capacity to deliver precise and structured information, offering a robust alternative to large language models and equipping researchers with essential data for fostering data-driven innovations.

# AttFC: Attention Fully-Connected Layer for Large-Scale Face Recognition with One GPU 

**Authors**: Zhuowen Zheng, Yain-Whar Si, Xiaochen Yuan, Junwei Duan, Ke Wang, Xiaofan Li, Xinyuan Zhang, Xueyuan Gong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06839)  

**Abstract**: Nowadays, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the availability of large-scale datasets, the face recognition (FR) model has achieved exceptional performance. However, since the parameter magnitude of the fully connected (FC) layer directly depends on the number of identities in the dataset. If training the FR model on large-scale datasets, the size of the model parameter will be excessively huge, leading to substantial demand for computational resources, such as time and memory. This paper proposes the attention fully connected (AttFC) layer, which could significantly reduce computational resources. AttFC employs an attention loader to generate the generative class center (GCC), and dynamically store the class center with Dynamic Class Container (DCC). DCC only stores a small subset of all class centers in FC, thus its parameter count is substantially less than the FC layer. Also, training face recognition models on large-scale datasets with one GPU often encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues. AttFC overcomes this and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.

# Towards a Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma 

**Authors**: Somayeh Farahani, Marjaneh Hejazi, Antonio Di Ieva, Emad Fatemizadeh, Sidong Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06828)  

**Abstract**: Accurate, noninvasive glioma characterization is crucial for effective clinical management. Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p<=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.

# Towards Fine-Grained Video Question Answering 

**Authors**: Wei Dai, Alan Luo, Zane Durante, Debadutta Dash, Arnold Milstein, Kevin Schulman, Ehsan Adeli, Li Fei-Fei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06820)  

**Abstract**: In the rapidly evolving domain of video understanding, Video Question Answering (VideoQA) remains a focal point. However, existing datasets exhibit gaps in temporal and spatial granularity, which consequently limits the capabilities of existing VideoQA methods. This paper introduces the Multi-Object Multi-Actor Question Answering (MOMA-QA) dataset, which is designed to address these shortcomings by emphasizing temporal localization, spatial relationship reasoning, and entity-centric queries. With ground truth scene graphs and temporal interval annotations, MOMA-QA is ideal for developing models for fine-grained video understanding. Furthermore, we present a novel video-language model, SGVLM, which incorporates a scene graph predictor, an efficient frame retriever, and a pre-trained large language model for temporal localization and fine-grained relationship understanding. Evaluations on MOMA-QA and other public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, setting new benchmarks for VideoQA.

# Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Knowledge Mining from Large Models 

**Authors**: Yuchen Mao, Hongwei Li, Yinyi Lai, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Peng Qi, Yunjie Yang, Chengjia Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06816)  

**Abstract**: Large-scale vision models like SAM have extensive visual knowledge, yet their general nature and computational demands limit their use in specialized tasks like medical image segmentation. In contrast, task-specific models such as U-Net++ often underperform due to sparse labeled data. This study introduces a strategic knowledge mining method that leverages SAM's broad understanding to boost the performance of small, locally hosted deep learning models.
In our approach, we trained a U-Net++ model on a limited labeled dataset and extend its capabilities by converting SAM's output infered on unlabeled images into prompts. This process not only harnesses SAM's generalized visual knowledge but also iteratively improves SAM's prediction to cater specialized medical segmentation tasks via U-Net++. The mined knowledge, serving as "pseudo labels", enriches the training dataset, enabling the fine-tuning of the local network.
Applied to the Kvasir SEG and COVID-QU-Ex datasets which consist of gastrointestinal polyp and lung X-ray images respectively, our proposed method consistently enhanced the segmentation performance on Dice by 3% and 1% respectively over the baseline U-Net++ model, when the same amount of labelled data were used during training (75% and 50% of labelled data). Remarkably, our proposed method surpassed the baseline U-Net++ model even when the latter was trained exclusively on labeled data (100% of labelled data). These results underscore the potential of knowledge mining to overcome data limitations in specialized models by leveraging the broad, albeit general, knowledge of large-scale models like SAM, all while maintaining operational efficiency essential for clinical applications.

# Unlocking Generalization for Robotics via Modularity and Scale 

**Authors**: Murtaza Dalal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06814)  

**Abstract**: How can we build generalist robot systems? Scale may not be enough due to the significant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and the challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed robotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent generalization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this thesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by integrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale learning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is: how can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key insight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level control end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more efficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in building generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast amounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source of supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source: classical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires access to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these planners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce generalist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with large-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of performing zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key ingredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control, procedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real transfer. We demonstrate that this recipe can produce a single, generalist agent that can solve challenging long-horizon manipulation tasks in the real world.

# Can Proof Assistants Verify Multi-Agent Systems? 

**Authors**: Julian Alfredo Mendez, Timotheus Kampik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06812)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents the Soda language for verifying multi-agent systems. Soda is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with Soda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.

# Mitigating Preference Hacking in Policy Optimization with Pessimism 

**Authors**: Dhawal Gupta, Adam Fisch, Christoph Dann, Alekh Agarwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06810)  

**Abstract**: This work tackles the problem of overoptimization in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), a prevalent technique for aligning models with human preferences. RLHF relies on reward or preference models trained on \emph{fixed preference datasets}, and these models are unreliable when evaluated outside the support of this preference data, leading to the common reward or preference hacking phenomenon. We propose novel, pessimistic objectives for RLHF which are provably robust to overoptimization through the use of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and design practical algorithms, P3O and PRPO, to optimize these objectives. Our approach is derived for the general preference optimization setting, but can be used with reward models as well. We evaluate P3O and PRPO on the tasks of fine-tuning language models for document summarization and creating helpful assistants, demonstrating remarkable resilience to overoptimization.

# Privacy Auditing of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Ashwinee Panda, Xinyu Tang, Milad Nasr, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Prateek Mittal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06808)  

**Abstract**: Current techniques for privacy auditing of large language models (LLMs) have limited efficacy -- they rely on basic approaches to generate canaries which leads to weak membership inference attacks that in turn give loose lower bounds on the empirical privacy leakage. We develop canaries that are far more effective than those used in prior work under threat models that cover a range of realistic settings. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on multiple families of fine-tuned LLMs that our approach sets a new standard for detection of privacy leakage. For measuring the memorization rate of non-privately trained LLMs, our designed canaries surpass prior approaches. For example, on the Qwen2.5-0.5B model, our designed canaries achieve $49.6\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR, vastly surpassing the prior approach's $4.2\%$ TPR at $1\%$ FPR. Our method can be used to provide a privacy audit of $\varepsilon \approx 1$ for a model trained with theoretical $\varepsilon$ of 4. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a privacy audit of LLM training has achieved nontrivial auditing success in the setting where the attacker cannot train shadow models, insert gradient canaries, or access the model at every iteration.

# Actionable AI: Enabling Non Experts to Understand and Configure AI Systems 

**Authors**: Cécile Boulard, Sruthi Viswanathan, Wanda Fey, Thierry Jacquin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06803)  

**Abstract**: Interaction between humans and AI systems raises the question of how people understand AI systems. This has been addressed with explainable AI, the interpretability arising from users' domain expertise, or collaborating with AI in a stable environment. In the absence of these elements, we discuss designing Actionable AI, which allows non-experts to configure black-box agents. In this paper, we experiment with an AI-powered cartpole game and observe 22 pairs of participants to configure it via direct manipulation. Our findings suggest that, in uncertain conditions, non-experts were able to achieve good levels of performance. By influencing the behaviour of the agent, they exhibited an operational understanding of it, which proved sufficient to reach their goals. Based on this, we derive implications for designing Actionable AI systems. In conclusion, we propose Actionable AI as a way to open access to AI-based agents, giving end users the agency to influence such agents towards their own goals.

# Characterizing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Astrocyte-Like Units 

**Authors**: Christopher S. Yang, Sylvester J. Gates III, Dulara De Zoysa, Jaehoon Choe, Wolfgang Losert, Corey B. Hart  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06798)  

**Abstract**: Traditional artificial neural networks take inspiration from biological networks, using layers of neuron-like nodes to pass information for processing. More realistic models include spiking in the neural network, capturing the electrical characteristics more closely. However, a large proportion of brain cells are of the glial cell type, in particular astrocytes which have been suggested to play a role in performing computations. Here, we introduce a modified spiking neural network model with added astrocyte-like units in a neural network and asses their impact on learning. We implement the network as a liquid state machine and task the network with performing a chaotic time-series prediction task. We varied the number and ratio of neuron-like and astrocyte-like units in the network to examine the latter units effect on learning. We show that the combination of neurons and astrocytes together, as opposed to neural- and astrocyte-only networks, are critical for driving learning. Interestingly, we found that the highest learning rate was achieved when the ratio between astrocyte-like and neuron-like units was roughly 2 to 1, mirroring some estimates of the ratio of biological astrocytes to neurons. Our results demonstrate that incorporating astrocyte-like units which represent information across longer timescales can alter the learning rates of neural networks, and the proportion of astrocytes to neurons should be tuned appropriately to a given task.

# Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia 

**Authors**: Sabeen Ahmed, Nathan Parker, Margaret Park, Evan W. Davis, Jennifer B. Permuth, Matthew B. Schabath, Yasin Yilmaz, Ghulam Rasool  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06797)  

**Abstract**: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival.

**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Lu Dong, Sahana Rangasrinivasan, Ifeoma Nwogu, Srirangaraj Setlur, Venugopal Govindaraju  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06791)  

**Abstract**: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: this https URL

# GenDR: Lightning Generative Detail Restorator 

**Authors**: Yan Wang, Shijie Zhao, Kai Chen, Kexin Zhang, Junlin Li, Li Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06790)  

**Abstract**: Recent research applying text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to real-world super-resolution (SR) has achieved remarkable success. However, fundamental misalignments between T2I and SR targets result in a dilemma between inference speed and detail fidelity. Specifically, T2I tasks prioritize multi-step inversion to synthesize coherent outputs aligned with textual prompts and shrink the latent space to reduce generating complexity. Contrariwise, SR tasks preserve most information from low-resolution input while solely restoring high-frequency details, thus necessitating sufficient latent space and fewer inference steps. To bridge the gap, we present a one-step diffusion model for generative detail restoration, GenDR, distilled from a tailored diffusion model with larger latent space. In detail, we train a new SD2.1-VAE16 (0.9B) via representation alignment to expand latent space without enlarging the model size. Regarding step-distillation, we propose consistent score identity distillation (CiD) that incorporates SR task-specific loss into score distillation to leverage more SR priors and align the training target. Furthermore, we extend CiD with adversarial learning and representation alignment (CiDA) to enhance perceptual quality and accelerate training. We also polish the pipeline to achieve a more efficient inference. Experimental results demonstrate that GenDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity.

# Infinite Leagues Under the Sea: Photorealistic 3D Underwater Terrain Generation by Latent Fractal Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Tianyi Zhang, Weiming Zhi, Joshua Mangelson, Matthew Johnson-Roberson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06784)  

**Abstract**: This paper tackles the problem of generating representations of underwater 3D terrain. Off-the-shelf generative models, trained on Internet-scale data but not on specialized underwater images, exhibit downgraded realism, as images of the seafloor are relatively uncommon. To this end, we introduce DreamSea, a generative model to generate hyper-realistic underwater scenes. DreamSea is trained on real-world image databases collected from underwater robot surveys. Images from these surveys contain massive real seafloor observations and covering large areas, but are prone to noise and artifacts from the real world. We extract 3D geometry and semantics from the data with visual foundation models, and train a diffusion model that generates realistic seafloor images in RGBD channels, conditioned on novel fractal distribution-based latent embeddings. We then fuse the generated images into a 3D map, building a 3DGS model supervised by 2D diffusion priors which allows photorealistic novel view rendering. DreamSea is rigorously evaluated, demonstrating the ability to robustly generate large-scale underwater scenes that are consistent, diverse, and photorealistic. Our work drives impact in multiple domains, spanning filming, gaming, and robot simulation.

# Dr Genre: Reinforcement Learning from Decoupled LLM Feedback for Generic Text Rewriting 

**Authors**: Yufei Li, John Nham, Ganesh Jawahar, Lei Shu, David Uthus, Yun-Hsuan Sung, Chengrun Yang, Itai Rolnick, Yi Qiao, Cong Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06781)  

**Abstract**: Generic text rewriting is a prevalent large language model (LLM) application that covers diverse real-world tasks, such as style transfer, fact correction, and email editing. These tasks vary in rewriting objectives (e.g., factual consistency vs. semantic preservation), making it challenging to develop a unified model that excels across all dimensions. Existing methods often specialize in either a single task or a specific objective, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we introduce a generic model proficient in factuality, stylistic, and conversational rewriting tasks. To simulate real-world user rewrite requests, we construct a conversational rewrite dataset, ChatRewrite, that presents ``natural''-sounding instructions, from raw emails using LLMs. Combined with other popular rewrite datasets, including LongFact for the factuality rewrite task and RewriteLM for the stylistic rewrite task, this forms a broad benchmark for training and evaluating generic rewrite models. To align with task-specific objectives, we propose Dr Genre, a Decoupled-reward learning framework for Generic rewriting, that utilizes objective-oriented reward models with a task-specific weighting. Evaluation shows that \approach delivers higher-quality rewrites across all targeted tasks, improving objectives including instruction following (agreement), internal consistency (coherence), and minimal unnecessary edits (conciseness).

# Large Language Models Are Effective Human Annotation Assistants, But Not Good Independent Annotators 

**Authors**: Feng Gu, Zongxia Li, Carlos Rafael Colon, Benjamin Evans, Ishani Mondal, Jordan Lee Boyd-Graber  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06778)  

**Abstract**: Event annotation is important for identifying market changes, monitoring breaking news, and understanding sociological trends. Although expert annotators set the gold standards, human coding is expensive and inefficient. Unlike information extraction experiments that focus on single contexts, we evaluate a holistic workflow that removes irrelevant documents, merges documents about the same event, and annotates the events. Although LLM-based automated annotations are better than traditional TF-IDF-based methods or Event Set Curation, they are still not reliable annotators compared to human experts. However, adding LLMs to assist experts for Event Set Curation can reduce the time and mental effort required for Variable Annotation. When using LLMs to extract event variables to assist expert annotators, they agree more with the extracted variables than fully automated LLMs for annotation.

# Effectiveness of Zero-shot-CoT in Japanese Prompts 

**Authors**: Shusuke Takayama, Ian Frank  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06765)  

**Abstract**: We compare the effectiveness of zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in Japanese and English using ChatGPT-3.5 and 4o-mini. The technique of zero-shot CoT, which involves appending a phrase such as "Let's think step by step" to a prompt to encourage reasoning before answering, has been shown to offer LLM performance improvements in mathematical and reasoning tasks, particularly in English. We investigate how these effects transfer to Japanese using the Japanese Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark (JMMLU) and the Multi-task Language Understanding Benchmark (MMLU). Our results show that while zero-shot CoT prompting can lead to notable performance gains for some prompt categories in GPT-3.5, its impact in GPT-4o-mini is associated with significant performance declines. However, for Japanese prompts there remain certain categories, such as college mathematics and abstract algebra, that still exhibit improvements, despite the broader trend of diminishing effectiveness in more advanced models.

# SemHiTok: A Unified Image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical Codebook for Multimodal Understanding and Generation 

**Authors**: Zisheng Chen, Chunwei Wang, Xiuwei Chen, Hang Xu, Jianhua Han, Xiandan Liang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06764)  

**Abstract**: We present SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete feature representations for multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Recently, unified multimodal large models (MLLMs) for understanding and generation have sparked exploration within research community. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss functions for semantic feature reconstruction and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation tasks, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook which builds texture sub-codebooks on pre-trained semantic codebook. This design decouples the training of semantic reconstruction and pixel reconstruction and equips the tokenizer with low-level texture feature extraction capability without degradation of high-level semantic feature extraction ability. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves state-of-the-art rFID score at 256X256resolution compared to other unified tokenizers, and exhibits competitive performance on multimodal understanding and generation tasks.

# Vision-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Multimodal Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Wenxuan Huang, Bohan Jia, Zijie Zhai, Shaosheng Cao, Zheyu Ye, Fei Zhao, Yao Hu, Shaohui Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06749)  

**Abstract**: DeepSeek-R1-Zero has successfully demonstrated the emergence of reasoning capabilities in LLMs purely through Reinforcement Learning (RL). Inspired by this breakthrough, we explore how RL can be utilized to enhance the reasoning capability of MLLMs. However, direct training with RL struggles to activate complex reasoning capabilities such as questioning and reflection in MLLMs, due to the absence of substantial high-quality multimodal reasoning data. To address this issue, we propose the reasoning MLLM, Vision-R1, to improve multimodal reasoning capability. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality multimodal CoT dataset without human annotations by leveraging an existing MLLM and DeepSeek-R1 through modality bridging and data filtering to obtain a 200K multimodal CoT dataset, Vision-R1-cold dataset. It serves as cold-start initialization data for Vision-R1. To mitigate the optimization challenges caused by overthinking after cold start, we propose Progressive Thinking Suppression Training (PTST) strategy and employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with the hard formatting result reward function to gradually refine the model's ability to learn correct and complex reasoning processes on a 10K multimodal math dataset. Comprehensive experiments show our model achieves an average improvement of $\sim$6% across various multimodal math reasoning benchmarks. Vision-R1-7B achieves a 73.5% accuracy on the widely used MathVista benchmark, which is only 0.4% lower than the leading reasoning model, OpenAI O1. The datasets and code will be released in: this https URL .

# Fully-Decentralized MADDPG with Networked Agents 

**Authors**: Diego Bolliger, Lorenz Zauter, Robert Ziegler  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06747)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we devise three actor-critic algorithms with decentralized training for multi-agent reinforcement learning in cooperative, adversarial, and mixed settings with continuous action spaces. To this goal, we adapt the MADDPG algorithm by applying a networked communication approach between agents. We introduce surrogate policies in order to decentralize the training while allowing for local communication during training. The decentralized algorithms achieve comparable results to the original MADDPG in empirical tests, while reducing computational cost. This is more pronounced with larger numbers of agents.

# Gender Encoding Patterns in Pretrained Language Model Representations 

**Authors**: Mahdi Zakizadeh, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06734)  

**Abstract**: Gender bias in pretrained language models (PLMs) poses significant social and ethical challenges. Despite growing awareness, there is a lack of comprehensive investigation into how different models internally represent and propagate such biases. This study adopts an information-theoretic approach to analyze how gender biases are encoded within various encoder-based architectures. We focus on three key aspects: identifying how models encode gender information and biases, examining the impact of bias mitigation techniques and fine-tuning on the encoded biases and their effectiveness, and exploring how model design differences influence the encoding of biases. Through rigorous and systematic investigation, our findings reveal a consistent pattern of gender encoding across diverse models. Surprisingly, debiasing techniques often exhibit limited efficacy, sometimes inadvertently increasing the encoded bias in internal representations while reducing bias in model output distributions. This highlights a disconnect between mitigating bias in output distributions and addressing its internal representations. This work provides valuable guidance for advancing bias mitigation strategies and fostering the development of more equitable language models.

# ACAI for SBOs: AI Co-creation for Advertising and Inspiration for Small Business Owners 

**Authors**: Nimisha Karnatak, Adrien Baranes, Rob Marchant, Triona Butler, Kristen Olson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06729)  

**Abstract**: Small business owners (SBOs) often lack the resources and design experience needed to produce high-quality advertisements. To address this, we developed ACAI (AI Co-Creation for Advertising and Inspiration), an GenAI-powered multimodal advertisement creation tool, and conducted a user study with 16 SBOs in London to explore their perceptions of and interactions with ACAI in advertisement creation. Our findings reveal that structured inputs enhance user agency and control while improving AI outputs by facilitating better brand alignment, enhancing AI transparency, and offering scaffolding that assists novice designers, such as SBOs, in formulating prompts. We also found that ACAI's multimodal interface bridges the design skill gap for SBOs with a clear advertisement vision, but who lack the design jargon necessary for effective prompting. Building on our findings, we propose three capabilities: contextual intelligence, adaptive interactions, and data management, with corresponding design recommendations to advance the co-creative attributes of AI-mediated design tools.

# Pull-Based Query Scheduling for Goal-Oriented Semantic Communication 

**Authors**: Pouya Agheli, Nikolaos Pappas, Marios Kountouris  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06725)  

**Abstract**: This paper addresses query scheduling for goal-oriented semantic communication in pull-based status update systems. We consider a system where multiple sensing agents (SAs) observe a source characterized by various attributes and provide updates to multiple actuation agents (AAs), which act upon the received information to fulfill their heterogeneous goals at the endpoint. A hub serves as an intermediary, querying the SAs for updates on observed attributes and maintaining a knowledge base, which is then broadcast to the AAs. The AAs leverage the knowledge to perform their actions effectively. To quantify the semantic value of updates, we introduce a grade of effectiveness (GoE) metric. Furthermore, we integrate cumulative perspective theory (CPT) into the long-term effectiveness analysis to account for risk awareness and loss aversion in the system. Leveraging this framework, we compute effect-aware scheduling policies aimed at maximizing the expected discounted sum of CPT-based total GoE provided by the transmitted updates while complying with a given query cost constraint. To achieve this, we propose a model-based solution based on dynamic programming and model-free solutions employing state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms. Our findings demonstrate that effect-aware scheduling significantly enhances the effectiveness of communicated updates compared to benchmark scheduling methods, particularly in settings with stringent cost constraints where optimal query scheduling is vital for system performance and overall effectiveness.

# Delusions of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Hongshen Xu, Zixv yang, Zichen Zhu, Kunyao Lan, Zihan Wang, Mengyue Wu, Ziwei Ji, Lu Chen, Pascale Fung, Kai Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06709)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models often generate factually incorrect but plausible outputs, known as hallucinations. We identify a more insidious phenomenon, LLM delusion, defined as high belief hallucinations, incorrect outputs with abnormally high confidence, making them harder to detect and mitigate. Unlike ordinary hallucinations, delusions persist with low uncertainty, posing significant challenges to model reliability. Through empirical analysis across different model families and sizes on several Question Answering tasks, we show that delusions are prevalent and distinct from hallucinations. LLMs exhibit lower honesty with delusions, which are harder to override via finetuning or self reflection. We link delusion formation with training dynamics and dataset noise and explore mitigation strategies such as retrieval augmented generation and multi agent debating to mitigate delusions. By systematically investigating the nature, prevalence, and mitigation of LLM delusions, our study provides insights into the underlying causes of this phenomenon and outlines future directions for improving model reliability.

# PFDial: A Structured Dialogue Instruction Fine-tuning Method Based on UML Flowcharts 

**Authors**: Ming Zhang, Yuhui Wang, Yujiong Shen, Tingyi Yang, Changhao Jiang, Yilong Wu, Shihan Dou, Qinhao Chen, Zhiheng Xi, Zhihao Zhang, Yi Dong, Zhen Wang, Zhihui Fei, Mingyang Wan, Tao Liang, Guojun Ma, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Xuanjing Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06706)  

**Abstract**: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in this https URL.

# InftyThink: Breaking the Length Limits of Long-Context Reasoning in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Yuchen Yan, Yongliang Shen, Yang Liu, Jin Jiang, Mengdi Zhang, Jian Shao, Yueting Zhuang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06692)  

**Abstract**: Advanced reasoning in large language models has achieved remarkable performance on challenging tasks, but the prevailing long-context reasoning paradigm faces critical limitations: quadratic computational scaling with sequence length, reasoning constrained by maximum context boundaries, and performance degradation beyond pre-training context windows. Existing approaches primarily compress reasoning chains without addressing the fundamental scaling problem. To overcome these challenges, we introduce InftyThink, a paradigm that transforms monolithic reasoning into an iterative process with intermediate summarization. By interleaving short reasoning segments with concise progress summaries, our approach enables unbounded reasoning depth while maintaining bounded computational costs. This creates a characteristic sawtooth memory pattern that significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, we develop a methodology for reconstructing long-context reasoning datasets into our iterative format, transforming OpenR1-Math into 333K training instances. Experiments across multiple model architectures demonstrate that our approach reduces computational costs while improving performance, with Qwen2.5-Math-7B showing 3-13% improvements across MATH500, AIME24, and GPQA_diamond benchmarks. Our work challenges the assumed trade-off between reasoning depth and computational efficiency, providing a more scalable approach to complex reasoning without architectural modifications.

# Censoring-Aware Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning for Estimating Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Censored Outcomes 

**Authors**: Animesh Kumar Paul, Russell Greiner  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06690)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) provide a systematic approach for making sequential treatment decisions that adapt to individual patient characteristics, particularly in clinical contexts where survival outcomes are of interest. Censoring-Aware Tree-Based Reinforcement Learning (CA-TRL) is a novel framework to address the complexities associated with censored data when estimating optimal DTRs. We explore ways to learn effective DTRs, from observational data. By enhancing traditional tree-based reinforcement learning methods with augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) and censoring-aware modifications, CA-TRL delivers robust and interpretable treatment strategies. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world applications using the SANAD epilepsy dataset, where it outperformed the recently proposed ASCL method in key metrics such as restricted mean survival time (RMST) and decision-making accuracy. This work represents a step forward in advancing personalized and data-driven treatment strategies across diverse healthcare settings.

# UniGenX: Unified Generation of Sequence and Structure with Autoregressive Diffusion 

**Authors**: Gongbo Zhang, Yanting Li, Renqian Luo, Pipi Hu, Zeru Zhao, Lingbo Li, Guoqing Liu, Zun Wang, Ran Bi, Kaiyuan Gao, Liya Guo, Yu Xie, Chang Liu, Jia Zhang, Tian Xie, Robert Pinsler, Claudio Zeni, Ziheng Lu, Yingce Xia, Marwin Segler, Maik Riechert, Li Yuan, Lei Chen, Haiguang Liu, Tao Qin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06687)  

**Abstract**: Unified generation of sequence and structure for scientific data (e.g., materials, molecules, proteins) is a critical task. Existing approaches primarily rely on either autoregressive sequence models or diffusion models, each offering distinct advantages and facing notable limitations. Autoregressive models, such as GPT, Llama, and Phi-4, have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language generation and have been extended to multimodal tasks (e.g., image, video, and audio) using advanced encoders like VQ-VAE to represent complex modalities as discrete sequences. However, their direct application to scientific domains is challenging due to the high precision requirements and the diverse nature of scientific data. On the other hand, diffusion models excel at generating high-dimensional scientific data, such as protein, molecule, and material structures, with remarkable accuracy. Yet, their inability to effectively model sequences limits their potential as general-purpose multimodal foundation models. To address these challenges, we propose UniGenX, a unified framework that combines autoregressive next-token prediction with conditional diffusion models. This integration leverages the strengths of autoregressive models to ease the training of conditional diffusion models, while diffusion-based generative heads enhance the precision of autoregressive predictions. We validate the effectiveness of UniGenX on material and small molecule generation tasks, achieving a significant leap in state-of-the-art performance for material crystal structure prediction and establishing new state-of-the-art results for small molecule structure prediction, de novo design, and conditional generation. Notably, UniGenX demonstrates significant improvements, especially in handling long sequences for complex structures, showcasing its efficacy as a versatile tool for scientific data generation.

# Exploring LLM Agents for Cleaning Tabular Machine Learning Datasets 

**Authors**: Tommaso Bendinelli, Artur Dox, Christian Holz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06664)  

**Abstract**: High-quality, error-free datasets are a key ingredient in building reliable, accurate, and unbiased machine learning (ML) models. However, real world datasets often suffer from errors due to sensor malfunctions, data entry mistakes, or improper data integration across multiple sources that can severely degrade model performance. Detecting and correcting these issues typically require tailor-made solutions and demand extensive domain expertise. Consequently, automation is challenging, rendering the process labor-intensive and tedious. In this study, we investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help alleviate the burden of manual data cleaning. We set up an experiment in which an LLM, paired with Python, is tasked with cleaning the training dataset to improve the performance of a learning algorithm without having the ability to modify the training pipeline or perform any feature engineering. We run this experiment on multiple Kaggle datasets that have been intentionally corrupted with errors. Our results show that LLMs can identify and correct erroneous entries, such as illogical values or outlier, by leveraging contextual information from other features within the same row, as well as feedback from previous iterations. However, they struggle to detect more complex errors that require understanding data distribution across multiple rows, such as trends and biases.

# AA-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-shot Anomaly Detection via Anomaly-Aware CLIP 

**Authors**: Wenxin Ma, Xu Zhang, Qingsong Yao, Fenghe Tang, Chenxu Wu, Yingtai Li, Rui Yan, Zihang Jiang, S.Kevin Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06661)  

**Abstract**: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies outliers for applications like defect and lesion detection. While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent Anomaly-Unawareness leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly-Aware CLIP (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications. The code is available at this https URL.

# Enhancing NLP Robustness and Generalization through LLM-Generated Contrast Sets: A Scalable Framework for Systematic Evaluation and Adversarial Training 

**Authors**: Hender Lin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06648)  

**Abstract**: Standard NLP benchmarks often fail to capture vulnerabilities stemming from dataset artifacts and spurious correlations. Contrast sets address this gap by challenging models near decision boundaries but are traditionally labor-intensive to create and limited in diversity. This study leverages large language models to automate the generation of diverse contrast sets. Using the SNLI dataset, we created a 3,000-example contrast set to evaluate and improve model robustness. Fine-tuning on these contrast sets enhanced performance on systematically perturbed examples, maintained standard test accuracy, and modestly improved generalization to novel perturbations. This automated approach offers a scalable solution for evaluating and improving NLP models, addressing systematic generalization challenges, and advancing robustness in real-world applications.

# Deep Cut-informed Graph Embedding and Clustering 

**Authors**: Zhiyuan Ning, Zaitian Wang, Ran Zhang, Ping Xu, Kunpeng Liu, Pengyang Wang, Chong Chen, Pengfei Wang, Yuanchun Zhou, Erik Cambria  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06635)  

**Abstract**: Graph clustering aims to divide the graph into different clusters. The recently emerging deep graph clustering approaches are largely built on graph neural networks (GNN). However, GNN is designed for general graph encoding and there is a common issue of representation collapse in existing GNN-based deep graph clustering algorithms. We attribute two main reasons for such issue: (i) the inductive bias of GNN models: GNNs tend to generate similar representations for proximal nodes. Since graphs often contain a non-negligible amount of inter-cluster links, the bias results in error message passing and leads to biased clustering; (ii) the clustering guided loss function: most traditional approaches strive to make all samples closer to pre-learned cluster centers, which cause a degenerate solution assigning all data points to a single label thus make all samples and less discriminative. To address these challenges, we investigate graph clustering from a graph cut perspective and propose an innovative and non-GNN-based Deep Cut-informed Graph embedding and Clustering framework, namely DCGC. This framework includes two modules: (i) cut-informed graph encoding; (ii) self-supervised graph clustering via optimal transport. For the encoding module, we derive a cut-informed graph embedding objective to fuse graph structure and attributes by minimizing their joint normalized cut. For the clustering module, we utilize the optimal transport theory to obtain the clustering assignments, which can balance the guidance of proximity to the pre-learned cluster center. With the above two tailored designs, DCGC is more suitable for the graph clustering task, which can effectively alleviate the problem of representation collapse and achieve better performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our method is simple but effective compared with benchmarks.

# BTFL: A Bayesian-based Test-Time Generalization Method for Internal and External Data Distributions in Federated learning 

**Authors**: Yu Zhou, Bingyan Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06633)  

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively develop a global model while maintaining data privacy. However, online FL deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts and evolving test samples. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) tailors the global model to individual client distributions, but struggles with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples during testing, leading to performance degradation. In real-world scenarios, balancing personalization and generalization during online testing is crucial and existing methods primarily focus on training-phase generalization. To address the test-time trade-off, we introduce a new scenario: Test-time Generalization for Internal and External Distributions in Federated Learning (TGFL), which evaluates adaptability under Internal Distribution (IND) and External Distribution (EXD). We propose BTFL, a Bayesian-based test-time generalization method for TGFL, which balances generalization and personalization at the sample level during testing. BTFL employs a two-head architecture to store local and global knowledge, interpolating predictions via a dual-Bayesian framework that considers both historical test data and current sample characteristics with theoretical guarantee and faster speed. Our experiments demonstrate that BTFL achieves improved performance across various datasets and models with less time cost. The source codes are made publicly available at this https URL .

# Hardware-Accelerated Event-Graph Neural Networks for Low-Latency Time-Series Classification on SoC FPGA 

**Authors**: Hiroshi Nakano, Krzysztof Blachut, Kamil Jeziorek, Piotr Wzorek, Manon Dampfhoffer, Thomas Mesquida, Hiroaki Nishi, Tomasz Kryjak, Thomas Dalgaty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06629)  

**Abstract**: As the quantities of data recorded by embedded edge sensors grow, so too does the need for intelligent local processing. Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.

# Revisiting Early Detection of Sexual Predators via Turn-level Optimization 

**Authors**: Jinmyeong An, Sangwon Ryu, Heejin Do, Yunsu Kim, Jungseul Ok, Gary Geunbae Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06627)  

**Abstract**: Online grooming is a severe social threat where sexual predators gradually entrap child victims with subtle and gradual manipulation. Therefore, timely intervention for online grooming is critical for proactive protection. However, previous methods fail to determine the optimal intervention points (i.e., jump to conclusions) as they rely on chat-level risk labels by causing weak supervision of risky utterances. For timely detection, we propose speed control reinforcement learning (SCoRL) (The code and supplementary materials are available at this https URL), incorporating a practical strategy derived from luring communication theory (LCT). To capture the predator's turn-level entrapment, we use a turn-level risk label based on the LCT. Then, we design a novel speed control reward function that balances the trade-off between speed and accuracy based on turn-level risk label; thus, SCoRL can identify the optimal intervention moment. In addition, we introduce a turn-level metric for precise evaluation, identifying limitations in previously used chat-level metrics. Experimental results show that SCoRL effectively preempted online grooming, offering a more proactive and timely solution. Further analysis reveals that our method enhances performance while intuitively identifying optimal early intervention points.

# DiffCLIP: Differential Attention Meets CLIP 

**Authors**: Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Bernard Ghanem  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06626)  

**Abstract**: We propose DiffCLIP, a novel vision-language model that extends the differential attention mechanism to CLIP architectures. Differential attention was originally developed for large language models to amplify relevant context while canceling out noisy information. In this work, we integrate this mechanism into CLIP's dual encoder (image and text) framework. With minimal additional parameters, DiffCLIP achieves superior performance on image-text understanding tasks. Across zero-shot classification, retrieval, and robustness benchmarks, DiffCLIP consistently outperforms baseline CLIP models. Notably, these gains come with negligible computational overhead, demonstrating that differential attention can significantly enhance multi-modal representations without sacrificing efficiency. Code can be found at this https URL.

# Using Subgraph GNNs for Node Classification:an Overlooked Potential Approach 

**Authors**: Qian Zeng, Xin Lin, Jingyi Gao, Yang Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06614)  

**Abstract**: Previous studies have demonstrated the strong performance of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in node classification. However, most existing GNNs adopt a node-centric perspective and rely on global message passing, leading to high computational and memory costs that hinder scalability. To mitigate these challenges, subgraph-based methods have been introduced, leveraging local subgraphs as approximations of full computational trees. While this approach improves efficiency, it often suffers from performance degradation due to the loss of global contextual information, limiting its effectiveness compared to global GNNs. To address this trade-off between scalability and classification accuracy, we reformulate the node classification task as a subgraph classification problem and propose SubGND (Subgraph GNN for NoDe). This framework introduces a differentiated zero-padding strategy and an Ego-Alter subgraph representation method to resolve label conflicts while incorporating an Adaptive Feature Scaling Mechanism to dynamically adjust feature contributions based on dataset-specific dependencies. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SubGND achieves performance comparable to or surpassing global message-passing GNNs, particularly in heterophilic settings, highlighting its effectiveness and scalability as a promising solution for node classification.

# WildIFEval: Instruction Following in the Wild 

**Authors**: Gili Lior, Asaf Yehudai, Ariel Gera, Liat Ein-Dor  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06573)  

**Abstract**: Recent LLMs have shown remarkable success in following user instructions, yet handling instructions with multiple constraints remains a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce WildIFEval - a large-scale dataset of 12K real user instructions with diverse, multi-constraint conditions. Unlike prior datasets, our collection spans a broad lexical and topical spectrum of constraints, in natural user prompts. We categorize these constraints into eight high-level classes to capture their distribution and dynamics in real-world scenarios. Leveraging WildIFEval, we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark the instruction-following capabilities of leading LLMs. Our findings reveal that all evaluated models experience performance degradation with an increasing number of constraints. Thus, we show that all models have a large room for improvement on such tasks. Moreover, we observe that the specific type of constraint plays a critical role in model performance. We release our dataset to promote further research on instruction-following under complex, realistic conditions.

# SHIP: A Shapelet-based Approach for Interpretable Patient-Ventilator Asynchrony Detection 

**Authors**: Xuan-May Le, Ling Luo, Uwe Aickelin, Minh-Tuan Tran, David Berlowitz, Mark Howard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06571)  

**Abstract**: Patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) is a common and critical issue during mechanical ventilation, affecting up to 85% of patients. PVA can result in clinical complications such as discomfort, sleep disruption, and potentially more severe conditions like ventilator-induced lung injury and diaphragm dysfunction. Traditional PVA management, which relies on manual adjustments by healthcare providers, is often inadequate due to delays and errors. While various computational methods, including rule-based, statistical, and deep learning approaches, have been developed to detect PVA events, they face challenges related to dataset imbalances and lack of interpretability. In this work, we propose a shapelet-based approach SHIP for PVA detection, utilizing shapelets - discriminative subsequences in time-series data - to enhance detection accuracy and interpretability. Our method addresses dataset imbalances through shapelet-based data augmentation and constructs a shapelet pool to transform the dataset for more effective classification. The combined shapelet and statistical features are then used in a classifier to identify PVA events. Experimental results on medical datasets show that SHIP significantly improves PVA detection while providing interpretable insights into model decisions.

# Conceptrol: Concept Control of Zero-shot Personalized Image Generation 

**Authors**: Qiyuan He, Angela Yao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06568)  

**Abstract**: Personalized image generation with text-to-image diffusion models generates unseen images based on reference image content. Zero-shot adapter methods such as IP-Adapter and OminiControl are especially interesting because they do not require test-time fine-tuning. However, they struggle to balance preserving personalized content and adherence to the text prompt. We identify a critical design flaw resulting in this performance gap: current adapters inadequately integrate personalization images with the textual descriptions. The generated images, therefore, replicate the personalized content rather than adhere to the text prompt instructions. Yet the base text-to-image has strong conceptual understanding capabilities that can be leveraged.
We propose Conceptrol, a simple yet effective framework that enhances zero-shot adapters without adding computational overhead. Conceptrol constrains the attention of visual specification with a textual concept mask that improves subject-driven generation capabilities. It achieves as much as 89% improvement on personalization benchmarks over the vanilla IP-Adapter and can even outperform fine-tuning approaches such as Dreambooth LoRA. The source code is available at this https URL.

# Human Cognition Inspired RAG with Knowledge Graph for Complex Problem Solving 

**Authors**: Yao Cheng, Yibo Zhao, Jiapeng Zhu, Yao Liu, Xing Sun, Xiang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06567)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.

**Authors**: Jiangdong Cai, Haotian Jiang, Zhenrong Shen, Yonghao Li, Honglin Xiong, Lichi Zhang, Qian Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06563)  

**Abstract**: The deployment of computer-aided diagnosis systems for cervical cancer screening using whole slide images (WSIs) faces critical challenges due to domain shifts caused by staining variations across different scanners and imaging environments. While existing stain augmentation methods improve patch-level robustness, they fail to scale to WSIs due to two key limitations: (1) inconsistent stain patterns when extending patch operations to gigapixel slides, and (2) prohibitive computational/storage costs from offline processing of augmented this http URL address this, we propose Latent Style Augmentation (LSA), a framework that performs efficient, online stain augmentation directly on WSI-level latent features. We first introduce WSAug, a WSI-level stain augmentation method ensuring consistent stain across patches within a WSI. Using offline-augmented WSIs by WSAug, we design and train Stain Transformer, which can simulate targeted style in the latent space, efficiently enhancing the robustness of the WSI-level classifier. We validate our method on a multi-scanner WSI dataset for cervical cancer diagnosis. Despite being trained on data from a single scanner, our approach achieves significant performance improvements on out-of-distribution data from other scanners. Code will be available at this https URL.

**Authors**: Jianwen Sun, Yukang Feng, Chuanhao Li, Fanrui Zhang, Zizhen Li, Jiaxin Ai, Sizhuo Zhou, Yu Dai, Shenglin Zhang, Kaipeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06542)  

**Abstract**: Unified models (UniMs) for multimodal understanding and generation have recently received much attention in the area of vision and language. Existing UniMs are designed to simultaneously learn both multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, demanding substantial computational resources, and often struggle to generate interleaved text-image. We present ARMOR, a resource-efficient and pure autoregressive framework that achieves both understanding and generation by fine-tuning existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, ARMOR extends existing MLLMs from three perspectives: (1) For model architecture, an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture with a forward-switching mechanism is introduced to unify embedding space integrating textual and visual modalities for enabling natural text-image interleaved generation with minimal computational overhead. (2) For training data, a meticulously curated, high-quality interleaved dataset is collected for fine-tuning MLLMs. (3) For the training algorithm, we propose a ``what or how to generate" algorithm to empower existing MLLMs with multimodal generation capabilities while preserving their multimodal understanding capabilities, through three progressive training stages based on the collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that ARMOR upgrades existing MLLMs to UniMs with promising image generation capabilities, using limited training resources. Our code will be released soon at this https URL.

# AnywhereDoor: Multi-Target Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection 

**Authors**: Jialin Lu, Junjie Shan, Ziqi Zhao, Ka-Ho Chow  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06529)  

**Abstract**: As object detection becomes integral to many safety-critical applications, understanding its vulnerabilities is essential. Backdoor attacks, in particular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim models, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors during inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target attacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target) before training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large output space of object detection (including object existence prediction, bounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible, inference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces AnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once implanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate new ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones, offering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by three key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of supported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against region-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level data imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack success rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such flexible control.

# From Motion Signals to Insights: A Unified Framework for Student Behavior Analysis and Feedback in Physical Education Classes 

**Authors**: Xian Gao, Jiacheng Ruan, Jingsheng Gao, Mingye Xie, Zongyun Zhang, Ting Liu, Yuzhuo Fu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06525)  

**Abstract**: Analyzing student behavior in educational scenarios is crucial for enhancing teaching quality and student engagement. Existing AI-based models often rely on classroom video footage to identify and analyze student behavior. While these video-based methods can partially capture and analyze student actions, they struggle to accurately track each student's actions in physical education classes, which take place in outdoor, open spaces with diverse activities, and are challenging to generalize to the specialized technical movements involved in these settings. Furthermore, current methods typically lack the ability to integrate specialized pedagogical knowledge, limiting their ability to provide in-depth insights into student behavior and offer feedback for optimizing instructional design. To address these limitations, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that leverages human activity recognition technologies based on motion signals, combined with advanced large language models, to conduct more detailed analyses and feedback of student behavior in physical education classes. Our framework begins with the teacher's instructional designs and the motion signals from students during physical education sessions, ultimately generating automated reports with teaching insights and suggestions for improving both learning and class instructions. This solution provides a motion signal-based approach for analyzing student behavior and optimizing instructional design tailored to physical education classes. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can accurately identify student behaviors and produce meaningful pedagogical insights.

# Generative AI as Digital Media 

**Authors**: Gilad Abiri  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06523)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI is frequently portrayed as revolutionary or even apocalyptic, prompting calls for novel regulatory approaches. This essay argues that such views are misguided. Instead, generative AI should be understood as an evolutionary step in the broader algorithmic media landscape, alongside search engines and social media. Like these platforms, generative AI centralizes information control, relies on complex algorithms to shape content, and extensively uses user data, thus perpetuating common problems: unchecked corporate power, echo chambers, and weakened traditional gatekeepers. Regulation should therefore share a consistent objective: ensuring media institutions remain trustworthy. Without trust, public discourse risks fragmenting into isolated communities dominated by comforting, tribal beliefs -- a threat intensified by generative AI's capacity to bypass gatekeepers and personalize truth. Current governance frameworks, such as the EU's AI Act and the US Executive Order 14110, emphasize reactive risk mitigation, addressing measurable threats like national security, public health, and algorithmic bias. While effective for novel technological risks, this reactive approach fails to adequately address broader issues of trust and legitimacy inherent to digital media. Proactive regulation fostering transparency, accountability, and public confidence is essential. Viewing generative AI exclusively as revolutionary risks repeating past regulatory failures that left social media and search engines insufficiently regulated. Instead, regulation must proactively shape an algorithmic media environment serving the public good, supporting quality information and robust civic discourse.

# Can Small Language Models Reliably Resist Jailbreak Attacks? A Comprehensive Evaluation 

**Authors**: Wenhui Zhang, Huiyu Xu, Zhibo Wang, Zeqing He, Ziqi Zhu, Kui Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06519)  

**Abstract**: Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to large language models (LLMs) due to their low computational demands, enhanced privacy guarantees and comparable performance in specific domains through light-weight fine-tuning. Deploying SLMs on edge devices, such as smartphones and smart vehicles, has become a growing trend. However, the security implications of SLMs have received less attention than LLMs, particularly regarding jailbreak attacks, which is recognized as one of the top threats of LLMs by the OWASP. In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of SLMs' vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Through systematically evaluation on 63 SLMs from 15 mainstream SLM families against 8 state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, we demonstrate that 47.6% of evaluated SLMs show high susceptibility to jailbreak attacks (ASR > 40%) and 38.1% of them can not even resist direct harmful query (ASR > 50%). We further analyze the reasons behind the vulnerabilities and identify four key factors: model size, model architecture, training datasets and training techniques. Moreover, we assess the effectiveness of three prompt-level defense methods and find that none of them achieve perfect performance, with detection accuracy varying across different SLMs and attack methods. Notably, we point out that the inherent security awareness play a critical role in SLM security, and models with strong security awareness could timely terminate unsafe response with little reminder. Building upon the findings, we highlight the urgent need for security-by-design approaches in SLM development and provide valuable insights for building more trustworthy SLM ecosystem.

# Towards Superior Quantization Accuracy: A Layer-sensitive Approach 

**Authors**: Feng Zhang, Yanbin Liu, Weihua Li, Jie Lv, Xiaodan Wang, Quan Bai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06518)  

**Abstract**: Large Vision and Language Models have exhibited remarkable human-like intelligence in tasks such as natural language comprehension, problem-solving, logical reasoning, and knowledge retrieval. However, training and serving these models require substantial computational resources, posing a significant barrier to their widespread application and further research. To mitigate this challenge, various model compression techniques have been developed to reduce computational requirements. Nevertheless, existing methods often employ uniform quantization configurations, failing to account for the varying difficulties across different layers in quantizing large neural network models. This paper tackles this issue by leveraging layer-sensitivity features, such as activation sensitivity and weight distribution Kurtosis, to identify layers that are challenging to quantize accurately and allocate additional memory budget. The proposed methods, named SensiBoost and KurtBoost, respectively, demonstrate notable improvement in quantization accuracy, achieving up to 9% lower perplexity with only a 2% increase in memory budget on LLama models compared to the baseline.

# GFlowVLM: Enhancing Multi-step Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Generative Flow Networks 

**Authors**: Haoqiang Kang, Enna Sachdeva, Piyush Gupta, Sangjae Bae, Kwonjoon Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06514)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promising advancements in sequential decision-making tasks through task-specific fine-tuning. However, common fine-tuning methods, such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), present notable limitations: SFT assumes Independent and Identically Distributed (IID) data, while PPO focuses on maximizing cumulative rewards. These limitations often restrict solution diversity and hinder generalization in multi-step reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, GFlowVLM, a framework that fine-tune VLMs using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to promote generation of diverse solutions for complex reasoning tasks. GFlowVLM models the environment as a non-Markovian decision process, allowing it to capture long-term dependencies essential for real-world applications. It takes observations and task descriptions as inputs to prompt chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning which subsequently guides action selection. We use task based rewards to fine-tune VLM with GFlowNets. This approach enables VLMs to outperform prior fine-tuning methods, including SFT and RL. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of GFlowVLM on complex tasks such as card games (NumberLine, BlackJack) and embodied planning tasks (ALFWorld), showing enhanced training efficiency, solution diversity, and stronger generalization capabilities across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

# HFedCKD: Toward Robust Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Data-free Knowledge Distillation and Two-way Contrast 

**Authors**: Yiting Zheng, Bohan Lin, Jinqian Chen, Jihua Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06511)  

**Abstract**: Most current federated learning frameworks are modeled as static processes, ignoring the dynamic characteristics of the learning system. Under the limited communication budget of the central server, the flexible model architecture of a large number of clients participating in knowledge transfer requires a lower participation rate, active clients have uneven contributions, and the client scale seriously hinders the performance of FL. We consider a more general and practical federation scenario and propose a system heterogeneous federation method based on data-free knowledge distillation and two-way contrast (HFedCKD). We apply the Inverse Probability Weighted Distillation (IPWD) strategy to the data-free knowledge transfer framework. The generator completes the data features of the nonparticipating clients. IPWD implements a dynamic evaluation of the prediction contribution of each client under different data distributions. Based on the antibiased weighting of its prediction loss, the weight distribution of each client is effectively adjusted to fairly integrate the knowledge of participating clients. At the same time, the local model is split into a feature extractor and a classifier. Through differential contrast learning, the feature extractor is aligned with the global model in the feature space, while the classifier maintains personalized decision-making capabilities. HFedCKD effectively alleviates the knowledge offset caused by a low participation rate under data-free knowledge distillation and improves the performance and stability of the model. We conduct extensive experiments on image and IoT datasets to comprehensively evaluate and verify the generalization and robustness of the proposed HFedCKD framework.

# A Light and Tuning-free Method for Simulating Camera Motion in Video Generation 

**Authors**: Quanjian Song, Zhihang Lin, Zhanpeng Zeng, Ziyue Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06508)  

**Abstract**: Existing camera motion-controlled video generation methods face computational bottlenecks in fine-tuning and inference. This paper proposes LightMotion, a light and tuning-free method for simulating camera motion in video generation. Operating in the latent space, it eliminates additional fine-tuning, inpainting, and depth estimation, making it more streamlined than existing methods. The endeavors of this paper comprise: (i) The latent space permutation operation effectively simulates various camera motions like panning, zooming, and rotation. (ii) The latent space resampling strategy combines background-aware sampling and cross-frame alignment to accurately fill new perspectives while maintaining coherence across frames. (iii) Our in-depth analysis shows that the permutation and resampling cause an SNR shift in latent space, leading to poor-quality generation. To address this, we propose latent space correction, which reintroduces noise during denoising to mitigate SNR shift and enhance video generation quality. Exhaustive experiments show that our LightMotion outperforms existing methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

# DynamicID: Zero-Shot Multi-ID Image Personalization with Flexible Facial Editability 

**Authors**: Xirui Hu, Jiahao Wang, Hao Chen, Weizhan Zhang, Benqi Wang, Yikun Li, Haishun Nan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06505)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have spurred interest in personalized human image generation, which aims to create novel images featuring specific human identities as reference images indicate. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.

**Authors**: Xukun Zhou, Fengxin Li, Ming Chen, Yan Zhou, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Hongyan Liu, Jun He, Zhaoxin Fan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06499)  

**Abstract**: Audio-driven human gesture synthesis is a crucial task with broad applications in virtual avatars, human-computer interaction, and creative content generation. Despite notable progress, existing methods often produce gestures that are coarse, lack expressiveness, and fail to fully align with audio semantics. To address these challenges, we propose ExGes, a novel retrieval-enhanced diffusion framework with three key designs: (1) a Motion Base Construction, which builds a gesture library using training dataset; (2) a Motion Retrieval Module, employing constrative learning and momentum distillation for fine-grained reference poses retreiving; and (3) a Precision Control Module, integrating partial masking and stochastic masking to enable flexible and fine-grained control. Experimental evaluations on BEAT2 demonstrate that ExGes reduces Fréchet Gesture Distance by 6.2\% and improves motion diversity by 5.3\% over EMAGE, with user studies revealing a 71.3\% preference for its naturalness and semantic relevance. Code will be released upon acceptance.

# Evaluation of Safety Cognition Capability in Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving 

**Authors**: Enming Zhang, Peizhe Gong, Xingyuan Dai, Yisheng Lv, Qinghai Miao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06497)  

**Abstract**: Assessing the safety of vision-language models (VLMs) in autonomous driving is particularly important; however, existing work mainly focuses on traditional benchmark evaluations. As interactive components within autonomous driving systems, VLMs must maintain strong safety cognition during interactions. From this perspective, we propose a novel evaluation method: Safety Cognitive Driving Benchmark (SCD-Bench) . To address the large-scale annotation challenge for SCD-Bench, we develop the Autonomous Driving Image-Text Annotation System (ADA) . Additionally, to ensure data quality in SCD-Bench, our dataset undergoes manual refinement by experts with professional knowledge in autonomous driving. We further develop an automated evaluation method based on large language models (LLMs). To verify its effectiveness, we compare its evaluation results with those of expert human evaluations, achieving a consistency rate of 99.74%. Preliminary experimental results indicate that existing open-source models still lack sufficient safety cognition, showing a significant gap compared to GPT-4o. Notably, lightweight models (1B-4B) demonstrate minimal safety cognition. However, since lightweight models are crucial for autonomous driving systems, this presents a significant challenge for integrating VLMs into the field.

# PerturboLLaVA: Reducing Multimodal Hallucinations with Perturbative Visual Training 

**Authors**: Cong Chen, Mingyu Liu, Chenchen Jing, Yizhou Zhou, Fengyun Rao, Hao Chen, Bo Zhang, Chunhua Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06486)  

**Abstract**: This paper aims to address the challenge of hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) particularly for dense image captioning tasks. To tackle the challenge, we identify the current lack of a metric that finely measures the caption quality in concept level. We hereby introduce HalFscore, a novel metric built upon the language graph and is designed to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of dense captions at a granular level. Additionally, we identify the root cause of hallucination as the model's over-reliance on its language prior. To address this, we propose PerturboLLaVA, which reduces the model's reliance on the language prior by incorporating adversarially perturbed text during training. This method enhances the model's focus on visual inputs, effectively reducing hallucinations and producing accurate, image-grounded descriptions without incurring additional computational overhead. PerturboLLaVA significantly improves the fidelity of generated captions, outperforming existing approaches in handling multimodal hallucinations and achieving improved performance across general multimodal benchmarks.

# Sign Language Translation using Frame and Event Stream: Benchmark Dataset and Algorithms 

**Authors**: Xiao Wang, Yuehang Li, Fuling Wang, Bo Jiang, Yaowei Wang, Yonghong Tian, Jin Tang, Bin Luo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06484)  

**Abstract**: Accurate sign language understanding serves as a crucial communication channel for individuals with disabilities. Current sign language translation algorithms predominantly rely on RGB frames, which may be limited by fixed frame rates, variable lighting conditions, and motion blur caused by rapid hand movements. Inspired by the recent successful application of event cameras in other fields, we propose to leverage event streams to assist RGB cameras in capturing gesture data, addressing the various challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale RGB-Event sign language translation dataset using the DVS346 camera, termed VECSL, which contains 15,676 RGB-Event samples, 15,191 glosses, and covers 2,568 Chinese characters. These samples were gathered across a diverse range of indoor and outdoor environments, capturing multiple viewing angles, varying light intensities, and different camera motions. Due to the absence of benchmark algorithms for comparison in this new task, we retrained and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art SLT algorithms, and believe that this benchmark can effectively support subsequent related research. Additionally, we propose a novel RGB-Event sign language translation framework (i.e., M$^2$-SLT) that incorporates fine-grained micro-sign and coarse-grained macro-sign retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art results on the proposed dataset. Both the source code and dataset will be released on this https URL.

# PDB: Not All Drivers Are the Same -- A Personalized Dataset for Understanding Driving Behavior 

**Authors**: Chuheng Wei, Ziye Qin, Siyan Li, Ziyan Zhang, Xuanpeng Zhao, Amr Abdelraouf, Rohit Gupta, Kyungtae Han, Matthew J. Barth, Guoyuan Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06477)  

**Abstract**: Driving behavior is inherently personal, influenced by individual habits, decision-making styles, and physiological states. However, most existing datasets treat all drivers as homogeneous, overlooking driver-specific variability. To address this gap, we introduce the Personalized Driving Behavior (PDB) dataset, a multi-modal dataset designed to capture personalization in driving behavior under naturalistic driving conditions. Unlike conventional datasets, PDB minimizes external influences by maintaining consistent routes, vehicles, and lighting conditions across sessions. It includes sources from 128-line LiDAR, front-facing camera video, GNSS, 9-axis IMU, CAN bus data (throttle, brake, steering angle), and driver-specific signals such as facial video and heart rate. The dataset features 12 participants, approximately 270,000 LiDAR frames, 1.6 million images, and 6.6 TB of raw sensor data. The processed trajectory dataset consists of 1,669 segments, each spanning 10 seconds with a 0.2-second interval. By explicitly capturing drivers' behavior, PDB serves as a unique resource for human factor analysis, driver identification, and personalized mobility applications, contributing to the development of human-centric intelligent transportation systems.

# HuixiangDou2: A Robustly Optimized GraphRAG Approach 

**Authors**: Huanjun Kong, Zhefan Wang, Chenyang Wang, Zhe Ma, Nanqing Dong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06474)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on familiar queries but struggle with specialized or emerging topics. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. Evaluating retrieval effectiveness is also challenging due to dataset overlap with LLM pretraining data. In this work, we introduce HuixiangDou2, a robustly optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we leverage the effectiveness of dual-level retrieval and optimize its performance in a 32k context for maximum precision, and compare logic-based retrieval and dual-level retrieval to enhance overall functionality. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on a test set, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. With our approach, the score improved significantly from 60 to 74.5, as illustrated in the Figure. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic-form retrieval improves structured reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage verification mechanism to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. Empirical results show significant accuracy gains over baselines, highlighting the importance of adaptive retrieval. To support research and adoption, we release HuixiangDou2 as an open-source resource this https URL.

# Enhancing Layer Attention Efficiency through Pruning Redundant Retrievals 

**Authors**: Hanze Li, Xiande Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06473)  

**Abstract**: Growing evidence suggests that layer attention mechanisms, which enhance interaction among layers in deep neural networks, have significantly advanced network architectures. However, existing layer attention methods suffer from redundancy, as attention weights learned by adjacent layers often become highly similar. This redundancy causes multiple layers to extract nearly identical features, reducing the model's representational capacity and increasing training time. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to quantify redundancy by leveraging the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between adjacent layers. Additionally, we introduce an Enhanced Beta Quantile Mapping (EBQM) method that accurately identifies and skips redundant layers, thereby maintaining model stability. Our proposed Efficient Layer Attention (ELA) architecture, improves both training efficiency and overall performance, achieving a 30\% reduction in training time while enhancing performance in tasks such as image classification and object detection.

# StructGS: Adaptive Spherical Harmonics and Rendering Enhancements for Superior 3D Gaussian Splatting 

**Authors**: Zexu Huang, Min Xu, Stuart Perry  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06462)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction coupled with neural rendering techniques have greatly improved the creation of photo-realistic 3D scenes, influencing both academic research and industry applications. The technique of 3D Gaussian Splatting and its variants incorporate the strengths of both primitive-based and volumetric representations, achieving superior rendering quality. While 3D Geometric Scattering (3DGS) and its variants have advanced the field of 3D representation, they fall short in capturing the stochastic properties of non-local structural information during the training process. Additionally, the initialisation of spherical functions in 3DGS-based methods often fails to engage higher-order terms in early training rounds, leading to unnecessary computational overhead as training progresses. Furthermore, current 3DGS-based approaches require training on higher resolution images to render higher resolution outputs, significantly increasing memory demands and prolonging training durations. We introduce StructGS, a framework that enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for improved novel-view synthesis in 3D reconstruction. StructGS innovatively incorporates a patch-based SSIM loss, dynamic spherical harmonics initialisation and a Multi-scale Residual Network (MSRN) to address the above-mentioned limitations, respectively. Our framework significantly reduces computational redundancy, enhances detail capture and supports high-resolution rendering from low-resolution inputs. Experimentally, StructGS demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving higher quality and more detailed renderings with fewer artifacts.

# Geometric Knowledge-Guided Localized Global Distribution Alignment for Federated Learning 

**Authors**: Yanbiao Ma, Wei Dai, Wenke Huang, Jiayi Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06457)  

**Abstract**: Data heterogeneity in federated learning, characterized by a significant misalignment between local and global distributions, leads to divergent local optimization directions and hinders global model training. Existing studies mainly focus on optimizing local updates or global aggregation, but these indirect approaches demonstrate instability when handling highly heterogeneous data distributions, especially in scenarios where label skew and domain skew coexist. To address this, we propose a geometry-guided data generation method that centers on simulating the global embedding distribution locally. We first introduce the concept of the geometric shape of an embedding distribution and then address the challenge of obtaining global geometric shapes under privacy constraints. Subsequently, we propose GGEUR, which leverages global geometric shapes to guide the generation of new samples, enabling a closer approximation to the ideal global distribution. In single-domain scenarios, we augment samples based on global geometric shapes to enhance model generalization; in multi-domain scenarios, we further employ class prototypes to simulate the global distribution across domains. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of existing approaches in handling highly heterogeneous data, including scenarios with label skew, domain skew, and their coexistence.

# CtrTab: Tabular Data Synthesis with High-Dimensional and Limited Data 

**Authors**: Zuqing Li, Jianzhong Qi, Junhao Gan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06444)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based tabular data synthesis models have yielded promising results. However, we observe that when the data dimensionality increases, existing models tend to degenerate and may perform even worse than simpler, non-diffusion-based models. This is because limited training samples in high-dimensional space often hinder generative models from capturing the distribution accurately. To address this issue, we propose CtrTab-a condition controlled diffusion model for tabular data synthesis-to improve the performance of diffusion-based generative models in high-dimensional, low-data scenarios. Through CtrTab, we inject samples with added Laplace noise as control signals to improve data diversity and show its resemblance to L2 regularization, which enhances model robustness. Experimental results across multiple datasets show that CtrTab outperforms state-of-the-art models, with performance gap in accuracy over 80% on average. Our source code will be released upon paper publication.

# Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Enhanced Tropical Cyclone Intensity Forecasting 

**Authors**: Fan Meng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06436)  

**Abstract**: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity prediction is crucial for mitigating storm hazards, yet its complex dynamics pose challenges to traditional methods. Here, we introduce a Physics-Informed Residual Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (PIR-NODE) model to precisely forecast TC intensity evolution. This model leverages the powerful non-linear fitting capabilities of deep learning, integrates residual connections to enhance model depth and training stability, and explicitly models the continuous temporal evolution of TC intensity using Neural ODEs. Experimental results in the SHIPS dataset demonstrate that the PIR-NODE model achieves a significant improvement in 24-hour intensity prediction accuracy compared to traditional statistical models and benchmark deep learning methods, with a 25. 2\% reduction in the root mean square error (RMSE) and a 19.5\% increase in R-square (R2) relative to a baseline of neural network. Crucially, the residual structure effectively preserves initial state information, and the model exhibits robust generalization capabilities. This study details the PIR-NODE model architecture, physics-informed integration strategies, and comprehensive experimental validation, revealing the substantial potential of deep learning techniques in predicting complex geophysical systems and laying the foundation for future refined TC forecasting research.

# Seesaw: High-throughput LLM Inference via Model Re-sharding 

**Authors**: Qidong Su, Wei Zhao, Xin Li, Muralidhar Andoorveedu, Chenhao Jiang, Zhanda Zhu, Kevin Song, Christina Giannoula, Gennady Pekhimenko  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06433)  

**Abstract**: To improve the efficiency of distributed large language model (LLM) inference, various parallelization strategies, such as tensor and pipeline parallelism, have been proposed. However, the distinct computational characteristics inherent in the two stages of LLM inference-prefilling and decoding-render a single static parallelization strategy insufficient for the effective optimization of both stages. In this work, we present Seesaw, an LLM inference engine optimized for throughput-oriented tasks. The key idea behind Seesaw is dynamic model re-sharding, a technique that facilitates the dynamic reconfiguration of parallelization strategies across stages, thereby maximizing throughput at both phases. To mitigate re-sharding overhead and optimize computational efficiency, we employ tiered KV cache buffering and transition-minimizing scheduling. These approaches work synergistically to reduce the overhead caused by frequent stage transitions while ensuring maximum batching efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Seesaw achieves a throughput increase of up to 1.78x (1.36x on average) compared to vLLM, the most widely used state-of-the-art LLM inference engine.

**Abstract**: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm for offering personalized recommendations through natural language dialogue. However, they face challenges with knowledge sparsity, as users often provide brief, incomplete preference statements. While recent methods have integrated external knowledge sources to mitigate this, they still struggle with semantic understanding and complex preference reasoning. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, showing significant potential for CRSs. Nevertheless, due to the lack of domain knowledge, existing LLM-based CRSs either produce hallucinated recommendations or demand expensive domain-specific training, which largely limits their applicability. In this work, we present G-CRS (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model for Conversational Recommender Systems), a novel training-free framework that combines graph retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning to enhance LLMs' recommendation capabilities. Specifically, G-CRS employs a two-stage retrieve-and-recommend architecture, where a GNN-based graph reasoner first identifies candidate items, followed by Personalized PageRank exploration to jointly discover potential items and similar user interactions. These retrieved contexts are then transformed into structured prompts for LLM reasoning, enabling contextually grounded recommendations without task-specific training. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that G-CRS achieves superior recommendation performance compared to existing methods without requiring task-specific training.

# Pre-Training Meta-Rule Selection Policy for Visual Generative Abductive Learning 

**Authors**: Yu Jin, Jingming Liu, Zhexu Luo, Yifei Peng, Ziang Qin, Wang-Zhou Dai, Yao-Xiang Ding, Kun Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06427)  

**Abstract**: Visual generative abductive learning studies jointly training symbol-grounded neural visual generator and inducing logic rules from data, such that after learning, the visual generation process is guided by the induced logic rules. A major challenge for this task is to reduce the time cost of logic abduction during learning, an essential step when the logic symbol set is large and the logic rule to induce is complicated. To address this challenge, we propose a pre-training method for obtaining meta-rule selection policy for the recently proposed visual generative learning approach AbdGen [Peng et al., 2023], aiming at significantly reducing the candidate meta-rule set and pruning the search space. The selection model is built based on the embedding representation of both symbol grounding of cases and meta-rules, which can be effectively integrated with both neural model and logic reasoning system. The pre-training process is done on pure symbol data, not involving symbol grounding learning of raw visual inputs, making the entire learning process low-cost. An additional interesting observation is that the selection policy can rectify symbol grounding errors unseen during pre-training, which is resulted from the memorization ability of attention mechanism and the relative stability of symbolic patterns. Experimental results show that our method is able to effectively address the meta-rule selection problem for visual abduction, boosting the efficiency of visual generative abductive learning.

**Authors**: Lin Zhang, Yuteng Zhang, Dusit Niyato, Lei Ren, Pengfei Gu, Zhen Chen, Yuanjun Laili, Wentong Cai, Agostino Bruzzone  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06422)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI (GenAI) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, and its integration into complex product modeling and simulation code generation can significantly enhance the efficiency of the system design phase in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). In this study, we introduce a generative system design methodology framework for MBSE, offering a practical approach for the intelligent generation of simulation models for system physical properties. First, we employ inference techniques, generative models, and integrated modeling and simulation languages to construct simulation models for system physical properties based on product design documents. Subsequently, we fine-tune the language model used for simulation model generation on an existing library of simulation models and additional datasets generated through generative modeling. Finally, we introduce evaluation metrics for the generated simulation models for system physical properties. Our proposed approach to simulation model generation presents the innovative concept of scalable templates for simulation models. Using these templates, GenAI generates simulation models for system physical properties through code completion. The experimental results demonstrate that, for mainstream open-source Transformer-based models, the quality of the simulation model is significantly improved using the simulation model generation method proposed in this paper.

# Swift Hydra: Self-Reinforcing Generative Framework for Anomaly Detection with Multiple Mamba Models 

**Authors**: Nguyen Do, Truc Nguyen, Malik Hassanaly, Raed Alharbi, Jung Taek Seo, My T. Thai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06413)  

**Abstract**: Despite a plethora of anomaly detection models developed over the years, their ability to generalize to unseen anomalies remains an issue, particularly in critical systems. This paper aims to address this challenge by introducing Swift Hydra, a new framework for training an anomaly detection method based on generative AI and reinforcement learning (RL). Through featuring an RL policy that operates on the latent variables of a generative model, the framework synthesizes novel and diverse anomaly samples that are capable of bypassing a detection model. These generated synthetic samples are, in turn, used to augment the detection model, further improving its ability to handle challenging anomalies. Swift Hydra also incorporates Mamba models structured as a Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable scalable adaptation of the number of Mamba experts based on data complexity, effectively capturing diverse feature distributions without increasing the model's inference time. Empirical evaluations on ADBench benchmark demonstrate that Swift Hydra outperforms other state-of-the-art anomaly detection models while maintaining a relatively short inference time. From these results, our research highlights a new and auspicious paradigm of integrating RL and generative AI for advancing anomaly detection.

# Decoding the Black Box: Integrating Moral Imagination with Technical AI Governance 

**Authors**: Krti Tallam  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06411)  

**Abstract**: This paper examines the intricate interplay among AI safety, security, and governance by integrating technical systems engineering with principles of moral imagination and ethical philosophy. Drawing on foundational insights from Weapons of Math Destruction and Thinking in Systems alongside contemporary debates in AI ethics, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework designed to regulate AI technologies deployed in high-stakes domains such as defense, finance, healthcare, and education. Our approach combines rigorous technical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to expose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed case studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level Grading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification, and lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine public trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI resilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols, and interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in ethical and technical AI governance.

# Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition 

**Authors**: Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua Reiss  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06405)  

**Abstract**: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

# Causality Enhanced Origin-Destination Flow Prediction in Data-Scarce Cities 

**Authors**: Tao Feng, Yunke Zhang, Huandong Wang, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06398)  

**Abstract**: Accurate origin-destination (OD) flow prediction is of great importance to developing cities, as it can contribute to optimize urban structures and layouts. However, with the common issues of missing regional features and lacking OD flow data, it is quite daunting to predict OD flow in developing cities. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Causality-Enhanced OD Flow Prediction (CE-OFP), a unified framework that aims to transfer urban knowledge between cities and achieve accuracy improvements in OD flow predictions across data-scarce cities. In specific, we propose a novel reinforcement learning model to discover universal causalities among urban features in data-rich cities and build corresponding causal graphs. Then, we further build Causality-Enhanced Variational Auto-Encoder (CE-VAE) to incorporate causal graphs for effective feature reconstruction in data-scarce cities. Finally, with the reconstructed features, we devise a knowledge distillation method with a graph attention network to migrate the OD prediction model from data-rich cities to data-scare cities. Extensive experiments on two pairs of real-world datasets validate that the proposed CE-OFP remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, which can reduce the RMSE of OD flow prediction for data-scarce cities by up to 11%.

# EPR-GAIL: An EPR-Enhanced Hierarchical Imitation Learning Framework to Simulate Complex User Consumption Behaviors 

**Authors**: Tao Feng, Yunke Zhang, Huandong Wang, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06392)  

**Abstract**: User consumption behavior data, which records individuals' online spending history at various types of stores, has been widely used in various applications, such as store recommendation, site selection, and sale forecasting. However, its high worth is limited due to deficiencies in data comprehensiveness and changes of application scenarios. Thus, generating high-quality sequential consumption data by simulating complex user consumption behaviors is of great importance to real-world applications. Two branches of existing sequence generation methods are both limited in quality. Model-based methods with simplified assumptions fail to model the complex decision process of user consumption, while data-driven methods that emulate real-world data are prone to noises, unobserved behaviors, and dynamic decision space. In this work, we propose to enhance the fidelity and trustworthiness of the data-driven Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) method by blending it with the Exploration and Preferential Return EPR model . The core idea of our EPR-GAIL framework is to model user consumption behaviors as a complex EPR decision process, which consists of purchase, exploration, and preference decisions. Specifically, we design the hierarchical policy function in the generator as a realization of the EPR decision process and employ the probability distributions of the EPR model to guide the reward function in the discriminator. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets of user consumption behaviors on an online platform demonstrate that the EPR-GAIL framework outperforms the best state-of-the-art baseline by over 19\% in terms of data fidelity. Furthermore, the generated consumption behavior data can improve the performance of sale prediction and location recommendation by up to 35.29% and 11.19%, respectively, validating its advantage for practical applications.

# VORTEX: Challenging CNNs at Texture Recognition by using Vision Transformers with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings 

**Authors**: Leonardo Scabini, Kallil M. Zielinski, Emir Konuk, Ricardo T. Fares, Lucas C. Ribas, Kevin Smith, Odemir M. Bruno  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06368)  

**Abstract**: Texture recognition has recently been dominated by ImageNet-pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with specialized modifications and feature engineering required to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, although Vision Transformers (ViTs) were introduced a few years ago, little is known about their texture recognition ability. Therefore, in this work, we introduce VORTEX (ViTs with Orderless and Randomized Token Encodings for Texture Recognition), a novel method that enables the effective use of ViTs for texture analysis. VORTEX extracts multi-depth token embeddings from pre-trained ViT backbones and employs a lightweight module to aggregate hierarchical features and perform orderless encoding, obtaining a better image representation for texture recognition tasks. This approach allows seamless integration with any ViT with the common transformer architecture. Moreover, no fine-tuning of the backbone is performed, since they are used only as frozen feature extractors, and the features are fed to a linear SVM. We evaluate VORTEX on nine diverse texture datasets, demonstrating its ability to achieve or surpass SOTA performance in a variety of texture analysis scenarios. By bridging the gap between texture recognition with CNNs and transformer-based architectures, VORTEX paves the way for adopting emerging transformer foundation models. Furthermore, VORTEX demonstrates robust computational efficiency when coupled with ViT backbones compared to CNNs with similar costs. The method implementation and experimental scripts are publicly available in our online repository.

# Machine Learning meets Algebraic Combinatorics: A Suite of Datasets Capturing Research-level Conjecturing Ability in Pure Mathematics 

**Authors**: Herman Chau, Helen Jenne, Davis Brown, Jesse He, Mark Raugas, Sara Billey, Henry Kvinge  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06366)  

**Abstract**: With recent dramatic increases in AI system capabilities, there has been growing interest in utilizing machine learning for reasoning-heavy, quantitative tasks, particularly mathematics. While there are many resources capturing mathematics at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate level, there are far fewer resources available that align with the level of difficulty and open endedness encountered by professional mathematicians working on open problems. To address this, we introduce a new collection of datasets, the Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo), representing either foundational results or open problems in algebraic combinatorics, a subfield of mathematics that studies discrete structures arising from abstract algebra. Further differentiating our dataset collection is the fact that it aims at the conjecturing process. Each dataset includes an open-ended research-level question and a large collection of examples (up to 10M in some cases) from which conjectures should be generated. We describe all nine datasets, the different ways machine learning models can be applied to them (e.g., training with narrow models followed by interpretability analysis or program synthesis with LLMs), and discuss some of the challenges involved in designing datasets like these.

# The AI Pentad, the CHARME$^{2}$D Model, and an Assessment of Current-State AI Regulation 

**Authors**: Di Kevin Gao, Sudip Mittal, Jiming Wu, Hongwei Du, Jingdao Chen, Shahram Rahimi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06353)  

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in the past few years with AI-enabled applications beginning to permeate every aspect of our society. Despite the widespread consensus on the need to regulate AI, there remains a lack of a unified approach to framing, developing, and assessing AI regulations. Many of the existing methods take a value-based approach, for example, accountability, fairness, free from bias, transparency, and trust. However, these methods often face challenges at the outset due to disagreements in academia over the subjective nature of these definitions. This paper aims to establish a unifying model for AI regulation from the perspective of core AI components. We first introduce the AI Pentad, which comprises the five essential components of AI: humans and organizations, algorithms, data, computing, and energy. We then review AI regulatory enablers, including AI registration and disclosure, AI monitoring, and AI enforcement mechanisms. Subsequently, we present the CHARME$^{2}$D Model to explore further the relationship between the AI Pentad and AI regulatory enablers. Finally, we apply the CHARME$^{2}$D model to assess AI regulatory efforts in the European Union (EU), China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps. This comparative evaluation offers insights for future legislative work in the AI domain.

# Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Samuel Garcin, Trevor McInroe, Pablo Samuel Castro, Prakash Panangaden, Christopher G. Lucas, David Abel, Stefano V. Albrecht  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06343)  

**Abstract**: Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment -- the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training. Our code, trained models and data are accessible at this https URL.

# States of LLM-generated Texts and Phase Transitions between them 

**Authors**: Nikolay Mikhaylovskiy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06330)  

**Abstract**: It is known for some time that autocorrelations of words in human-written texts decay according to a power law. Recent works have also shown that the autocorrelations decay in texts generated by LLMs is qualitatively different from the literary texts. Solid state physics tie the autocorrelations decay laws to the states of matter. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, depending on the temperature parameter, LLMs can generate text that can be classified as solid, critical state or gas.

# Advancing Autonomous Vehicle Intelligence: Deep Learning and Multimodal LLM for Traffic Sign Recognition and Robust Lane Detection 

**Authors**: Chandan Kumar Sah, Ankit Kumar Shaw, Xiaoli Lian, Arsalan Shahid Baig, Tuopu Wen, Kun Jiang, Mengmeng Yang, Diange Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06313)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require reliable traffic sign recognition and robust lane detection capabilities to ensure safe navigation in complex and dynamic environments. This paper introduces an integrated approach combining advanced deep learning techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for comprehensive road perception. For traffic sign recognition, we systematically evaluate ResNet-50, YOLOv8, and RT-DETR, achieving state-of-the-art performance of 99.8% with ResNet-50, 98.0% accuracy with YOLOv8, and achieved 96.6% accuracy in RT-DETR despite its higher computational complexity. For lane detection, we propose a CNN-based segmentation method enhanced by polynomial curve fitting, which delivers high accuracy under favorable conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight, Multimodal, LLM-based framework that directly undergoes instruction tuning using small yet diverse datasets, eliminating the need for initial pretraining. This framework effectively handles various lane types, complex intersections, and merging zones, significantly enhancing lane detection reliability by reasoning under adverse conditions. Despite constraints in available training resources, our multimodal approach demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities, achieving a Frame Overall Accuracy (FRM) of 53.87%, a Question Overall Accuracy (QNS) of 82.83%, lane detection accuracies of 99.6% in clear conditions and 93.0% at night, and robust performance in reasoning about lane invisibility due to rain (88.4%) or road degradation (95.6%). The proposed comprehensive framework markedly enhances AV perception reliability, thus contributing significantly to safer autonomous driving across diverse and challenging road scenarios.

# Synergizing AI and Digital Twins for Next-Generation Network Optimization, Forecasting, and Security 

**Authors**: Zifan Zhang, Minghong Fang, Dianwei Chen, Xianfeng Yang, Yuchen Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06302)  

**Abstract**: Digital network twins (DNTs) are virtual representations of physical networks, designed to enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of network performance. When integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL), DNTs emerge as powerful solutions for managing the complexities of network operations. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the synergy of DNTs, FL, and RL techniques, showcasing their collective potential to address critical challenges in 6G networks. We highlight key technical challenges that need to be addressed, such as ensuring network reliability, achieving joint data-scenario forecasting, and maintaining security in high-risk environments. Additionally, we propose several pipelines that integrate DNT and ML within coherent frameworks to enhance network optimization and security. Case studies demonstrate the practical applications of our proposed pipelines in edge caching and vehicular networks. In edge caching, the pipeline achieves over 80% cache hit rates while balancing base station loads. In autonomous vehicular system, it ensure a 100% no-collision rate, showcasing its reliability in safety-critical scenarios. By exploring these synergies, we offer insights into the future of intelligent and adaptive network systems that automate decision-making and problem-solving.

# Single Domain Generalization with Adversarial Memory 

**Authors**: Hao Yan, Marzi Heidari, Yuhong Guo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06288)  

**Abstract**: Domain Generalization (DG) aims to train models that can generalize to unseen testing domains by leveraging data from multiple training domains. However, traditional DG methods rely on the availability of multiple diverse training domains, limiting their applicability in data-constrained scenarios. Single Domain Generalization (SDG) addresses the more realistic and challenging setting by restricting the training data to a single domain distribution. The main challenges in SDG stem from the limited diversity of training data and the inaccessibility of unseen testing data distributions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a single domain generalization method that leverages an adversarial memory bank to augment training features. Our memory-based feature augmentation network maps both training and testing features into an invariant subspace spanned by diverse memory features, implicitly aligning the training and testing domains in the projected space. To maintain a diverse and representative feature memory bank, we introduce an adversarial feature generation method that creates features extending beyond the training domain distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard single domain generalization benchmarks.

# Your Large Vision-Language Model Only Needs A Few Attention Heads For Visual Grounding 

**Authors**: Seil Kang, Jinyeong Kim, Junhyeok Kim, Seong Jae Hwang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06287)  

**Abstract**: Visual grounding seeks to localize the image region corresponding to a free-form text description. Recently, the strong multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven substantial improvements in visual grounding, though they inevitably require fine-tuning and additional model components to explicitly generate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. However, we discover that a few attention heads in frozen LVLMs demonstrate strong visual grounding capabilities. We refer to these heads, which consistently capture object locations related to text semantics, as localization heads. Using localization heads, we introduce a straightforward and effective training-free visual grounding framework that utilizes text-to-image attention maps from localization heads to identify the target objects. Surprisingly, only three out of thousands of attention heads are sufficient to achieve competitive localization performance compared to existing LVLM-based visual grounding methods that require fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that LVLMs can innately ground objects based on a deep comprehension of the text-image relationship, as they implicitly focus on relevant image regions to generate informative text outputs. All the source codes will be made available to the public.

# Applied Machine Learning Methods with Long-Short Term Memory Based Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Temperature Prediction 

**Authors**: Bojan Lukić  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06278)  

**Abstract**: This paper gives an overview on how to develop a dense and deep neural network for making a time series prediction. First, the history and cornerstones in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be presented. After a short introduction to the theory of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, the paper will go deeper into the techniques for conducting a time series prediction with different models of neural networks. For this project, Python's development environment Jupyter, extended with the TensorFlow package and deep-learning application Keras is used. The system setup and project framework are explained in more detail before discussing the time series prediction. The main part shows an applied example of time series prediction with weather data. For this work, a deep recurrent neural network with Long Short-Term Memory cells is used to conduct the time series prediction. The results and evaluation of the work show that a weather prediction with deep neural networks can be successful for a short time period. However, there are some drawbacks and limitations with time series prediction, which will be discussed towards the end of the paper.

# Using Mechanistic Interpretability to Craft Adversarial Attacks against Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Thomas Winninger, Boussad Addad, Katarzyna Kapusta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06269)  

**Abstract**: Traditional white-box methods for creating adversarial perturbations against LLMs typically rely only on gradient computation from the targeted model, ignoring the internal mechanisms responsible for attack success or failure. Conversely, interpretability studies that analyze these internal mechanisms lack practical applications beyond runtime interventions. We bridge this gap by introducing a novel white-box approach that leverages mechanistic interpretability techniques to craft practical adversarial inputs. Specifically, we first identify acceptance subspaces - sets of feature vectors that do not trigger the model's refusal mechanisms - then use gradient-based optimization to reroute embeddings from refusal subspaces to acceptance subspaces, effectively achieving jailbreaks. This targeted approach significantly reduces computation cost, achieving attack success rates of 80-95\% on state-of-the-art models including Gemma2, Llama3.2, and Qwen2.5 within minutes or even seconds, compared to existing techniques that often fail or require hours of computation. We believe this approach opens a new direction for both attack research and defense development. Furthermore, it showcases a practical application of mechanistic interpretability where other methods are less efficient, which highlights its utility. The code and generated datasets are available at this https URL.

# Critical Foreign Policy Decisions (CFPD)-Benchmark: Measuring Diplomatic Preferences in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Benjamin Jensen, Ian Reynolds, Yasir Atalan, Michael Garcia, Austin Woo, Anthony Chen, Trevor Howarth  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06263)  

**Abstract**: As national security institutions increasingly integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into decision-making and content generation processes, understanding the inherent biases of large language models (LLMs) is crucial. This study presents a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the biases and preferences of seven prominent foundation models-Llama 3.1 8B Instruct, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002, Mixtral 8x22B, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Qwen2 72B-in the context of international relations (IR). We designed a bias discovery study around core topics in IR using 400-expert crafted scenarios to analyze results from our selected models. These scenarios focused on four topical domains including: military escalation, military and humanitarian intervention, cooperative behavior in the international system, and alliance dynamics. Our analysis reveals noteworthy variation among model recommendations based on scenarios designed for the four tested domains. Particularly, Qwen2 72B, Gemini 1.5 Pro-002 and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct models offered significantly more escalatory recommendations than Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models. All models exhibit some degree of country-specific biases, often recommending less escalatory and interventionist actions for China and Russia compared to the United States and the United Kingdom. These findings highlight the necessity for controlled deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments, emphasizing the need for domain-specific evaluations and model fine-tuning to align with institutional objectives.

# From Captions to Rewards (CAREVL): Leveraging Large Language Model Experts for Enhanced Reward Modeling in Large Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Muzhi Dai, Jiashuo Sun, Zhiyuan Zhao, Shixuan Liu, Rui Li, Junyu Gao, Xuelong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06260)  

**Abstract**: Aligning large vision-language models (LVLMs) with human preferences is challenging due to the scarcity of fine-grained, high-quality, and multimodal preference data without human annotations. Existing methods relying on direct distillation often struggle with low-confidence data, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose CAREVL, a novel method for preference reward modeling by reliably using both high- and low-confidence data. First, a cluster of auxiliary expert models (textual reward models) innovatively leverages image captions as weak supervision signals to filter high-confidence data. The high-confidence data are then used to fine-tune the LVLM. Second, low-confidence data are used to generate diverse preference samples using the fine-tuned LVLM. These samples are then scored and selected to construct reliable chosen-rejected pairs for further training. CAREVL achieves performance improvements over traditional distillation-based methods on VL-RewardBench and MLLM-as-a-Judge benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code will be released soon.

# Can Atomic Step Decomposition Enhance the Self-structured Reasoning of Multimodal Large Models? 

**Authors**: Kun Xiang, Zhili Liu, Zihao Jiang, Yunshuang Nie, Kaixin Cai, Yiyang Yin, Runhui Huang, Haoxiang Fan, Hanhui Li, Weiran Huang, Yihan Zeng, Yu-Jie Yuan, Jianhua Han, Lanqing Hong, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06252)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the ability of "slow thinking" into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that different levels of reasoning abilities can be combined dynamically to tackle questions with different complexity. To this end, we propose a paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which is composed of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomenon of overthinking. To introduce structured reasoning capabilities into visual understanding models, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is now public available in this https URL.

**Authors**: Minghao Fu, Danning Li, Aryan Gadhiya, Benjamin Lambright, Mohamed Alowais, Mohab Bahnassy, Saad El Dine Elletter, Hawau Olamide Toyin, Haiyan Jiang, Kun Zhang, Hanan Aldarmaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06247)  

**Abstract**: This paper addresses a major challenge in acoustic event detection, in particular infant cry detection in the presence of other sounds and background noises: the lack of precise annotated data. We present two contributions for supervised and unsupervised infant cry detection. The first is an annotated dataset for cry segmentation, which enables supervised models to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we propose a novel unsupervised method, Causal Representation Spare Transition Clustering (CRSTC), based on causal temporal representation, which helps address the issue of data scarcity more generally. By integrating the detected cry segments, we significantly improve the performance of downstream infant cry classification, highlighting the potential of this approach for infant care applications.

**Authors**: Kibum Kim, Sein Kim, Hongseok Kang, Jiwan Kim, Heewoong Noh, Yeonjun In, Kanghoon Yoon, Jinoh Oh, Chanyoung Park  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06238)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for recommender systems. Existing LLM-based recommender systems take two different approaches for representing items in natural language, i.e., Attribute-based Representation and Description-based Representation. In this work, we aim to address the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness that these two approaches encounter, when representing items consumed by users. Based on our interesting observation that there is a significant information overlap between images and descriptions associated with items, we propose a novel method, Image is all you need for LLM-based Recommender system (I-LLMRec). Our main idea is to leverage images as an alternative to lengthy textual descriptions for representing items, aiming at reducing token usage while preserving the rich semantic information of item descriptions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that I-LLMRec outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging images. Moreover, a further appeal of I-LLMRec is its ability to reduce sensitivity to noise in descriptions, leading to more robust recommendations.

# A Frank System for Co-Evolutionary Hybrid Decision-Making 

**Authors**: Federico Mazzoni, Riccardo Guidotti, Alessio Malizia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06229)  

**Abstract**: We introduce Frank, a human-in-the-loop system for co-evolutionary hybrid decision-making aiding the user to label records from an un-labeled dataset. Frank employs incremental learning to ``evolve'' in parallel with the user's decisions, by training an interpretable machine learning model on the records labeled by the user. Furthermore, Frank advances state-of-the-art approaches by offering inconsistency controls, explanations, fairness checks, and bad-faith safeguards simultaneously. We evaluate our proposal by simulating the users' behavior with various levels of expertise and reliance on Frank's suggestions. The experiments show that Frank's intervention leads to improvements in the accuracy and the fairness of the decisions.

# Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation 

**Authors**: Kedi Xiea, Martin Guay, Shimin Wang, Fang Deng, Maobin Lu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06226)  

**Abstract**: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.

# GraphGen+: Advancing Distributed Subgraph Generation and Graph Learning On Industrial Graphs 

**Authors**: Yue Jin, Yongchao Liu, Chuntao Hong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06212)  

**Abstract**: Graph-based computations are crucial in a wide range of applications, where graphs can scale to trillions of edges. To enable efficient training on such large graphs, mini-batch subgraph sampling is commonly used, which allows training without loading the entire graph into memory. However, existing solutions face significant trade-offs: online subgraph generation, as seen in frameworks like DGL and PyG, is limited to a single machine, resulting in severe performance bottlenecks, while offline precomputed subgraphs, as in GraphGen, improve sampling efficiency but introduce large storage overhead and high I/O costs during training. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{GraphGen+}, an integrated framework that synchronizes distributed subgraph generation with in-memory graph learning, eliminating the need for external storage while significantly improving efficiency. GraphGen+ achieves a \textbf{27$\times$} speedup in subgraph generation compared to conventional SQL-like methods and a \textbf{1.3$\times$} speedup over GraphGen, supporting training on 1 million nodes per iteration and removing the overhead associated with precomputed subgraphs, making it a scalable and practical solution for industry-scale graph learning.

# Text-Speech Language Models with Improved Cross-Modal Transfer by Aligning Abstraction Levels 

**Authors**: Santiago Cuervo, Adel Moumen, Yanis Labrak, Sameer Khurana, Antoine Laurent, Mickael Rouvier, Ricard Marxer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06211)  

**Abstract**: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- aim to enable cross-modal knowledge transfer to overcome the scaling limitations of unimodal speech LMs. The predominant approach to TSLM training expands the vocabulary of a pre-trained text LM by appending new embeddings and linear projections for speech, followed by fine-tuning on speech data. We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.

# Distributed Graph Neural Network Inference With Just-In-Time Compilation For Industry-Scale Graphs 

**Authors**: Xiabao Wu, Yongchao Liu, Wei Qin, Chuntao Hong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06208)  

**Abstract**: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have delivered remarkable results in various fields. However, the rapid increase in the scale of graph data has introduced significant performance bottlenecks for GNN inference. Both computational complexity and memory usage have risen dramatically, with memory becoming a critical limitation. Although graph sampling-based subgraph learning methods can help mitigate computational and memory demands, they come with drawbacks such as information loss and high redundant computation among subgraphs. This paper introduces an innovative processing paradgim for distributed graph learning that abstracts GNNs with a new set of programming interfaces and leverages Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation technology to its full potential. This paradigm enables GNNs to highly exploit the computational resources of distributed clusters by eliminating the drawbacks of subgraph learning methods, leading to a more efficient inference process. Our experimental results demonstrate that on industry-scale graphs of up to \textbf{500 million nodes and 22.4 billion edges}, our method can produce a performance boost of up to \textbf{27.4 times}.

# CUPCase: Clinically Uncommon Patient Cases and Diagnoses Dataset 

**Authors**: Oriel Perets, Ofir Ben Shoham, Nir Grinberg, Nadav Rappoport  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06204)  

**Abstract**: Medical benchmark datasets significantly contribute to developing Large Language Models (LLMs) for medical knowledge extraction, diagnosis, summarization, and other uses. Yet, current benchmarks are mainly derived from exam questions given to medical students or cases described in the medical literature, lacking the complexity of real-world patient cases that deviate from classic textbook abstractions. These include rare diseases, uncommon presentations of common diseases, and unexpected treatment responses. Here, we construct Clinically Uncommon Patient Cases and Diagnosis Dataset (CUPCase) based on 3,562 real-world case reports from BMC, including diagnoses in open-ended textual format and as multiple-choice options with distractors. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general-purpose and Clinical LLMs, to identify and correctly diagnose a patient case, and test models' performance when only partial information about cases is available. Our findings show that general-purpose GPT-4o attains the best performance in both the multiple-choice task (average accuracy of 87.9%) and the open-ended task (BERTScore F1 of 0.764), outperforming several LLMs with a focus on the medical domain such as Meditron-70B and MedLM-Large. Moreover, GPT-4o was able to maintain 87% and 88% of its performance with only the first 20% of tokens of the case presentation in multiple-choice and free text, respectively, highlighting the potential of LLMs to aid in early diagnosis in real-world cases. CUPCase expands our ability to evaluate LLMs for clinical decision support in an open and reproducible manner.

# Explainable Synthetic Image Detection through Diffusion Timestep Ensembling 

**Authors**: Yixin Wu, Feiran Zhang, Tianyuan Shi, Ruicheng Yin, Zhenghua Wang, Zhenliang Gan, Xiaohua Wang, Changze Lv, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xuanjing Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06201)  

**Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled the creation of deceptively real images, posing significant security risks when misused. In this study, we reveal that natural and synthetic images exhibit distinct differences in the high-frequency domains of their Fourier power spectra after undergoing iterative noise perturbations through an inverse multi-step denoising process, suggesting that such noise can provide additional discriminative information for identifying synthetic images. Based on this observation, we propose a novel detection method that amplifies these differences by progressively adding noise to the original images across multiple timesteps, and train an ensemble of classifiers on these noised images. To enhance human comprehension, we introduce an explanation generation and refinement module to identify flaws located in AI-generated images. Additionally, we construct two new datasets, GenHard and GenExplain, derived from the GenImage benchmark, providing detection samples of greater difficulty and high-quality rationales for fake images. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.91% and 95.89% detection accuracy on regular and harder samples, increasing a minimal of 2.51% and 3.46% compared to baselines. Furthermore, our method also generalizes effectively to images generated by other diffusion models. Our code and datasets will be made publicly available.

**Authors**: Agnia Sergeyuk, Ilya Zakharov, Ekaterina Koshchenko, Maliheh Izadi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06195)  

**Abstract**: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is reshaping software development, fundamentally altering how developers interact with their tools. This shift marks the emergence of Human-AI Experience in Integrated Development Environment (in-IDE HAX), a field that explores the evolving dynamics of Human-Computer Interaction in AI-assisted coding environments. Despite rapid adoption, research on in-IDE HAX remains fragmented which highlights the need for a unified overview of current practices, challenges, and opportunities. To provide a structured overview of existing research, we conduct a systematic literature review of 89 studies, summarizing current findings and outlining areas for further investigation.
Our findings reveal that AI-assisted coding enhances developer productivity but also introduces challenges, such as verification overhead, automation bias, and over-reliance, particularly among novice developers. Furthermore, concerns about code correctness, security, and maintainability highlight the urgent need for explainability, verification mechanisms, and adaptive user control. Although recent advances have driven the field forward, significant research gaps remain, including a lack of longitudinal studies, personalization strategies, and AI governance frameworks. This review provides a foundation for advancing in-IDE HAX research and offers guidance for responsibly integrating AI into software development.

# MSConv: Multiplicative and Subtractive Convolution for Face Recognition 

**Authors**: Si Zhou, Yain-Whar Si, Xiaochen Yuan, Xiaofan Li, Xiaoxiang Liu, Xinyuan Zhang, Cong Lin, Xueyuan Gong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06187)  

**Abstract**: In Neural Networks, there are various methods of feature fusion. Different strategies can significantly affect the effectiveness of feature representation, consequently influencing the ability of model to extract representative and discriminative features. In the field of face recognition, traditional feature fusion methods include feature concatenation and feature addition. Recently, various attention mechanism-based fusion strategies have emerged. However, we found that these methods primarily focus on the important features in the image, referred to as salient features in this paper, while neglecting another equally important set of features for image recognition tasks, which we term differential features. This may cause the model to overlook critical local differences when dealing with complex facial samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an efficient convolution module called MSConv (Multiplicative and Subtractive Convolution), designed to balance the learning of model about salient and differential features. Specifically, we employ multi-scale mixed convolution to capture both local and broader contextual information from face images, and then utilize Multiplication Operation (MO) and Subtraction Operation (SO) to extract salient and differential features, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that by integrating both salient and differential features, MSConv outperforms models that only focus on salient features.

# Sample-aware Adaptive Structured Pruning for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Jun Kong, Xinge Ma, Jin Wang, Xuejie Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06184)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance in natural language processing, but enormous model sizes and high computational costs limit their practical deployment. Structured pruning can effectively reduce the resource demands for deployment by removing redundant model parameters. However, the randomly selected calibration data and fixed single importance estimation metrics in existing structured pruning methods lead to degraded performance of pruned models. This study introduces AdaPruner, a sample-aware adaptive structured pruning framework for LLMs, aiming to optimize the calibration data and importance estimation metrics in the structured pruning process. Specifically, AdaPruner effectively removes redundant parameters from LLMs by constructing a structured pruning solution space and then employing Bayesian optimization to adaptively search for the optimal calibration data and importance estimation metrics. Experimental results show that the AdaPruner outperforms existing structured pruning methods on a family of LLMs with varying pruning ratios, demonstrating its applicability and robustness. Remarkably, at a 20\% pruning ratio, the model pruned with AdaPruner maintains 97\% of the performance of the unpruned model.

**Authors**: Francesco Daghero, Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Francesco Conti, Luca Benini, Massimo Poncino, Alessio Burrello  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06183)  

**Abstract**: The acceleration of pruned Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices such as Microcontrollers (MCUs) is a challenging task, given the tight area- and power-constraints of these devices. In this work, we propose a three-fold contribution to address this problem. First, we design a set of optimized software kernels for N:M pruned layers, targeting ultra-low-power, multicore RISC-V MCUs, which are up to 2.1x and 3.4x faster than their dense counterparts at 1:8 and 1:16 sparsity, respectively. Then, we implement a lightweight Instruction-Set Architecture (ISA) extension to accelerate the indirect load and non-zero indices decompression operations required by our kernels, obtaining up to 1.9x extra speedup, at the cost of a 5% area overhead. Lastly, we extend an open-source DNN compiler to utilize our sparse kernels for complete networks, showing speedups of 3.21x and 1.81x on a ResNet18 and a Vision Transformer (ViT), with less than 1.5% accuracy drop compared to a dense baseline.

# Minion Gated Recurrent Unit for Continual Learning 

**Authors**: Abdullah M. Zyarah, Dhireesha Kudithipudi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06175)  

**Abstract**: The increasing demand for continual learning in sequential data processing has led to progressively complex training methodologies and larger recurrent network architectures. Consequently, this has widened the knowledge gap between continual learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their ability to operate on devices with limited memory and compute. To address this challenge, we investigate the effectiveness of simplifying RNN architectures, particularly gated recurrent unit (GRU), and its impact on both single-task and multitask sequential learning. We propose a new variant of GRU, namely the minion recurrent unit (MiRU). MiRU replaces conventional gating mechanisms with scaling coefficients to regulate dynamic updates of hidden states and historical context, reducing computational costs and memory requirements. Despite its simplified architecture, MiRU maintains performance comparable to the standard GRU while achieving 2.90x faster training and reducing parameter usage by 2.88x, as demonstrated through evaluations on sequential image classification and natural language processing benchmarks. The impact of model simplification on its learning capacity is also investigated by performing continual learning tasks with a rehearsal-based strategy and global inhibition. We find that MiRU demonstrates stable performance in multitask learning even when using only rehearsal, unlike the standard GRU and its variants. These features position MiRU as a promising candidate for edge-device applications.

# ROCM: RLHF on consistency models 

**Authors**: Shivanshu Shekhar, Tong Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06171)  

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have revolutionized generative modeling in continuous domains like image, audio, and video synthesis. However, their iterative sampling process leads to slow generation and inefficient training, challenges that are further exacerbated when incorporating Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) due to sparse rewards and long time horizons. Consistency models address these issues by enabling single-step or efficient multi-step generation, significantly reducing computational costs.
In this work, we propose a direct reward optimization framework for applying RLHF to consistency models, incorporating distributional regularization to enhance training stability and prevent reward hacking. We investigate various $f$-divergences as regularization strategies, striking a balance between reward maximization and model consistency. Unlike policy gradient methods, our approach leverages first-order gradients, making it more efficient and less sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Empirical results show that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to policy gradient based RLHF methods, across various automatic metrics and human evaluation. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates the impact of different regularization techniques in improving model generalization and preventing overfitting.

# Treble Counterfactual VLMs: A Causal Approach to Hallucination 

**Authors**: Li Li, Jiashu Qu, Yuxiao Zhou, Yuehan Qin, Tiankai Yang, Yue Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06169)  

**Abstract**: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced multi-modal tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and reasoning. However, they often generate hallucinated outputs inconsistent with the visual context or prompt, limiting reliability in critical applications like autonomous driving and medical imaging. Existing studies link hallucination to statistical biases, language priors, and biased feature learning but lack a structured causal understanding. In this work, we introduce a causal perspective to analyze and mitigate hallucination in VLMs. We hypothesize that hallucination arises from unintended direct influences of either the vision or text modality, bypassing proper multi-modal fusion. To address this, we construct a causal graph for VLMs and employ counterfactual analysis to estimate the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of vision, text, and their cross-modal interaction on the output. We systematically identify and mitigate these unintended direct effects to ensure that responses are primarily driven by genuine multi-modal fusion. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) designing structural causal graphs to distinguish correct fusion pathways from spurious modality shortcuts, (2) estimating modality-specific and cross-modal NDE using perturbed image representations, hallucinated text embeddings, and degraded visual inputs, and (3) implementing a test-time intervention module to dynamically adjust the model's dependence on each modality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination while preserving task performance, providing a robust and interpretable framework for improving VLM reliability.

# Secure On-Device Video OOD Detection Without Backpropagation 

**Authors**: Li Li, Peilin Cai, Yuxiao Zhou, Zhiyu Ni, Renjie Liang, You Qin, Yi Nian, Zhengzhong Tu, Xiyang Hu, Yue Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06166)  

**Abstract**: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. While deploying personalized OOD detection directly on edge devices is desirable, it remains challenging due to large model sizes and the computational infeasibility of on-device training. Federated learning partially addresses this but still requires gradient computation and backpropagation, exceeding the capabilities of many edge devices. To overcome these challenges, we propose SecDOOD, a secure cloud-device collaboration framework for efficient on-device OOD detection without requiring device-side backpropagation. SecDOOD utilizes cloud resources for model training while ensuring user data privacy by retaining sensitive information on-device. Central to SecDOOD is a HyperNetwork-based personalized parameter generation module, which adapts cloud-trained models to device-specific distributions by dynamically generating local weight adjustments, effectively combining central and local information without local fine-tuning. Additionally, our dynamic feature sampling and encryption strategy selectively encrypts only the most informative feature channels, largely reducing encryption overhead without compromising detection performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and OOD scenarios demonstrate that SecDOOD achieves performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, enabling secure, efficient, and personalized OOD detection on resource-limited edge devices. To enhance accessibility and reproducibility, our code is publicly available at this https URL.

# Feature-EndoGaussian: Feature Distilled Gaussian Splatting in Surgical Deformable Scene Reconstruction 

**Authors**: Kai Li, Junhao Wang, William Han, Ding Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06161)  

**Abstract**: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has transformed clinical practice by reducing recovery times, minimizing complications, and enhancing precision. Nonetheless, MIS inherently relies on indirect visualization and precise instrument control, posing unique challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled real-time surgical scene understanding through techniques such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation, with scene reconstruction emerging as a key element for enhanced intraoperative guidance. Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have been explored for this purpose, their substantial data requirements and slow rendering inhibit real-time performance. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a more efficient alternative, achieving state-of-the-art performance in dynamic surgical scene reconstruction. In this work, we introduce Feature-EndoGaussian (FEG), an extension of 3DGS that integrates 2D segmentation cues into 3D rendering to enable real-time semantic and scene reconstruction. By leveraging pretrained segmentation foundation models, FEG incorporates semantic feature distillation within the Gaussian deformation framework, thereby enhancing both reconstruction fidelity and segmentation accuracy. On the EndoNeRF dataset, FEG achieves superior performance (SSIM of 0.97, PSNR of 39.08, and LPIPS of 0.03) compared to leading methods. Additionally, on the EndoVis18 dataset, FEG demonstrates competitive class-wise segmentation metrics while balancing model size and real-time performance.

# UrbanVideo-Bench: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Embodied Intelligence with Video Data in Urban Spaces 

**Authors**: Baining Zhao, Jianjie Fang, Zichao Dai, Ziyou Wang, Jirong Zha, Weichen Zhang, Chen Gao, Yue Wang, Jinqiang Cui, Xinlei Chen, Yong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06157)  

**Abstract**: Large multimodal models exhibit remarkable intelligence, yet their embodied cognitive abilities during motion in open-ended urban 3D space remain to be explored. We introduce a benchmark to evaluate whether video-large language models (Video-LLMs) can naturally process continuous first-person visual observations like humans, enabling recall, perception, reasoning, and navigation. We have manually control drones to collect 3D embodied motion video data from real-world cities and simulated environments, resulting in 1.5k video clips. Then we design a pipeline to generate 5.2k multiple-choice questions. Evaluations of 17 widely-used Video-LLMs reveal current limitations in urban embodied cognition. Correlation analysis provides insight into the relationships between different tasks, showing that causal reasoning has a strong correlation with recall, perception, and navigation, while the abilities for counterfactual and associative reasoning exhibit lower correlation with other tasks. We also validate the potential for Sim-to-Real transfer in urban embodiment through fine-tuning.

# Exploring the usage of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Ionospheric electron density estimation 

**Authors**: Miquel Garcia-Fernandez  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06144)  

**Abstract**: A fundamental limitation of traditional Neural Networks (NN) in predictive modelling is their inability to quantify uncertainty in their outputs. In critical applications like positioning systems, understanding the reliability of predictions is critical for constructing confidence intervals, early warning systems, and effectively propagating results. For instance, Precise Point Positioning in satellite navigation heavily relies on accurate error models for ancillary data (orbits, clocks, ionosphere, and troposphere) to compute precise error estimates. In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to establish robust protection levels in safety critical applications.
To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at exploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and associated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC). In this context, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a promising approach to achieve this goal. However, constructing an effective PNN requires meticulous design of hidden and output layers, as well as careful definition of prior and posterior probability distributions for network weights and biases.
A key finding of this study is that the uncertainty provided by the PNN model in VTEC estimates may be systematically underestimated. In low-latitude areas, the actual error was observed to be as much as twice the model's estimate. This underestimation is expected to be more pronounced during solar maximum, correlating with increased VTEC values.

# GSV3D: Gaussian Splatting-based Geometric Distillation with Stable Video Diffusion for Single-Image 3D Object Generation 

**Authors**: Ye Tao, Jiawei Zhang, Yahao Shi, Dongqing Zou, Bin Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06136)  

**Abstract**: Image-based 3D generation has vast applications in robotics and gaming, where high-quality, diverse outputs and consistent 3D representations are crucial. However, existing methods have limitations: 3D diffusion models are limited by dataset scarcity and the absence of strong pre-trained priors, while 2D diffusion-based approaches struggle with geometric consistency. We propose a method that leverages 2D diffusion models' implicit 3D reasoning ability while ensuring 3D consistency via Gaussian-splatting-based geometric distillation. Specifically, the proposed Gaussian Splatting Decoder enforces 3D consistency by transforming SV3D latent outputs into an explicit 3D representation. Unlike SV3D, which only relies on implicit 2D representations for video generation, Gaussian Splatting explicitly encodes spatial and appearance attributes, enabling multi-view consistency through geometric constraints. These constraints correct view inconsistencies, ensuring robust geometric consistency. As a result, our approach simultaneously generates high-quality, multi-view-consistent images and accurate 3D models, providing a scalable solution for single-image-based 3D generation and bridging the gap between 2D Diffusion diversity and 3D structural coherence. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art multi-view consistency and strong generalization across diverse datasets. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

# Feature Fusion Attention Network with CycleGAN for Image Dehazing, De-Snowing and De-Raining 

**Authors**: Akshat Jain  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06107)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel approach to image dehazing by combining Feature Fusion Attention (FFA) networks with CycleGAN architecture. Our method leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to effectively remove haze from images while preserving crucial image details. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates significant improvements in image quality metrics, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores compared to traditional dehazing methods. Through extensive experimentation on the RESIDE and DenseHaze CVPR 2019 dataset, we show that our approach effectively handles both synthetic and real-world hazy images. CycleGAN handles the unpaired nature of hazy and clean images effectively, enabling the model to learn mappings even without paired data.

# ULTHO: Ultra-Lightweight yet Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization in Deep Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Mingqi Yuan, Bo Li, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06101)  

**Abstract**: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a billion-dollar problem in machine learning, which significantly impacts the training efficiency and model performance. However, achieving efficient and robust HPO in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is consistently challenging due to its high non-stationarity and computational cost. To tackle this problem, existing approaches attempt to adapt common HPO techniques (e.g., population-based training or Bayesian optimization) to the RL scenario. However, they remain sample-inefficient and computationally expensive, which cannot facilitate a wide range of applications. In this paper, we propose ULTHO, an ultra-lightweight yet powerful framework for fast HPO in deep RL within single runs. Specifically, we formulate the HPO process as a multi-armed bandit with clustered arms (MABC) and link it directly to long-term return optimization. ULTHO also provides a quantified and statistical perspective to filter the HPs efficiently. We test ULTHO on benchmarks including ALE, Procgen, MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the ULTHO can achieve superior performance with simple architecture, contributing to the development of advanced and automated RL systems.

# ZO-DARTS++: An Efficient and Size-Variable Zeroth-Order Neural Architecture Search Algorithm 

**Authors**: Lunchen Xie, Eugenio Lomurno, Matteo Gambella, Danilo Ardagna, Manual Roveri, Matteo Matteucci, Qingjiang Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06092)  

**Abstract**: Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides a promising avenue for automating the complex design of deep learning (DL) models. However, current differentiable NAS methods often face constraints in efficiency, operation selection, and adaptability under varying resource limitations. We introduce ZO-DARTS++, a novel NAS method that effectively balances performance and resource constraints. By integrating a zeroth-order approximation for efficient gradient handling, employing a sparsemax function with temperature annealing for clearer and more interpretable architecture distributions, and adopting a size-variable search scheme for generating compact yet accurate architectures, ZO-DARTS++ establishes a new balance between model complexity and performance. In extensive tests on medical imaging datasets, ZO-DARTS++ improves the average accuracy by up to 1.8\% over standard DARTS-based methods and shortens search time by approximately 38.6\%. Additionally, its resource-constrained variants can reduce the number of parameters by more than 35\% while maintaining competitive accuracy levels. Thus, ZO-DARTS++ offers a versatile and efficient framework for generating high-quality, resource-aware DL models suitable for real-world medical applications.

# T-CBF: Traversability-based Control Barrier Function to Navigate Vertically Challenging Terrain 

**Authors**: Manas Gupta, Xuesu Xiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06083)  

**Abstract**: Safety has been of paramount importance in motion planning and control techniques and is an active area of research in the past few years. Most safety research for mobile robots target at maintaining safety with the notion of collision avoidance. However, safety goes beyond just avoiding collisions, especially when robots have to navigate unstructured, vertically challenging, off-road terrain, where vehicle rollover and immobilization is as critical as collisions. In this work, we introduce a novel Traversability-based Control Barrier Function (T-CBF), in which we use neural Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to achieve safety beyond collision avoidance on unstructured vertically challenging terrain by reasoning about new safety aspects in terms of traversability. The neural T-CBF trained on safe and unsafe observations specific to traversability safety is then used to generate safe trajectories. Furthermore, we present experimental results in simulation and on a physical Verti-4 Wheeler (V4W) platform, demonstrating that T-CBF can provide traversability safety while reaching the goal position. T-CBF planner outperforms previously developed planners by 30\% in terms of keeping the robot safe and mobile when navigating on real world vertically challenging terrain.

Webster, Katherine Chou, Avinatan Hassidim, Yossi Matias, James Manyika, Ryutaro Tanno, Vivek Natarajan, Adam Rodman, Tao Tu, Alan Karthikesalingam, Mike Schaekermann

**Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue, their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters, response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21 primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies (US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in disease management.

# GEM: Empowering MLLM for Grounded ECG Understanding with Time Series and Images 

**Authors**: Xiang Lan, Feng Wu, Kai He, Qinghao Zhao, Shenda Hong, Mengling Feng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06073)  

**Abstract**: While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Yu, Jianfeng Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06072)  

**Abstract**: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed natural language processing, making them indispensable across domains ranging from conversational systems to scientific exploration. However, their pre-trained architectures often reveal limitations in specialized contexts, including restricted reasoning capacities, ethical uncertainties, and suboptimal domain-specific performance. These challenges necessitate advanced post-training language models (PoLMs) to address these shortcomings, such as OpenAI-o1/o3 and DeepSeek-R1 (collectively known as Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs). This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of PoLMs, systematically tracing their evolution across five core paradigms: Fine-tuning, which enhances task-specific accuracy; Alignment, which ensures alignment with human preferences; Reasoning, which advances multi-step inference despite challenges in reward design; Efficiency, which optimizes resource utilization amidst increasing complexity; and Integration and Adaptation, which extend capabilities across diverse modalities while addressing coherence issues. Charting progress from ChatGPT's foundational alignment strategies to DeepSeek-R1's innovative reasoning advancements, we illustrate how PoLMs leverage datasets to mitigate biases, deepen reasoning capabilities, and enhance domain adaptability. Our contributions include a pioneering synthesis of PoLM evolution, a structured taxonomy categorizing techniques and datasets, and a strategic agenda emphasizing the role of LRMs in improving reasoning proficiency and domain flexibility. As the first survey of its scope, this work consolidates recent PoLM advancements and establishes a rigorous intellectual framework for future research, fostering the development of LLMs that excel in precision, ethical robustness, and versatility across scientific and societal applications.

# A Novel Trustworthy Video Summarization Algorithm Through a Mixture of LoRA Experts 

**Authors**: Wenzhuo Du, Gerun Wang, Guancheng Chen, Hang Zhao, Xin Li, Jian Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06064)  

**Abstract**: With the exponential growth of user-generated content on video-sharing platforms, the challenge of facilitating efficient searching and browsing of videos has garnered significant attention. To enhance users' ability to swiftly locate and review pertinent videos, the creation of concise and informative video summaries has become increasingly important. Video-llama is an effective tool for generating video summarization, but it cannot effectively unify and optimize the modeling of temporal and spatial features and requires a lot of computational resources and time. Therefore, we propose MiLoRA-ViSum to more efficiently capture complex temporal dynamics and spatial relationships inherent in video data and to control the number of parameters for training. By extending traditional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into a sophisticated mixture-of-experts paradigm, MiLoRA-ViSum incorporates a dual temporal-spatial adaptation mechanism tailored specifically for video summarization tasks. This approach dynamically integrates specialized LoRA experts, each fine-tuned to address distinct temporal or spatial dimensions. Extensive evaluations of the VideoXum and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate that MiLoRA-ViSum achieves the best summarization performance compared to state-of-the-art models, while maintaining significantly lower computational costs. The proposed mixture-of-experts strategy, combined with the dual adaptation mechanism, highlights the model's potential to enhance video summarization capabilities, particularly in large-scale applications requiring both efficiency and precision.

# STAR: A Foundation Model-driven Framework for Robust Task Planning and Failure Recovery in Robotic Systems 

**Authors**: Md Sadman Sakib, Yu Sun  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06060)  

**Abstract**: Modern robotic systems, deployed across domains from industrial automation to domestic assistance, face a critical challenge: executing tasks with precision and adaptability in dynamic, unpredictable environments. To address this, we propose STAR (Smart Task Adaptation and Recovery), a novel framework that synergizes Foundation Models (FMs) with dynamically expanding Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enable resilient task planning and autonomous failure recovery. While FMs offer remarkable generalization and contextual reasoning, their limitations, including computational inefficiency, hallucinations, and output inconsistencies hinder reliable deployment. STAR mitigates these issues by embedding learned knowledge into structured, reusable KGs, which streamline information retrieval, reduce redundant FM computations, and provide precise, scenario-specific insights. The framework leverages FM-driven reasoning to diagnose failures, generate context-aware recovery strategies, and execute corrective actions without human intervention or system restarts. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on rigid protocols, STAR dynamically expands its KG with experiential knowledge, ensuring continuous adaptation to novel scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we developed a comprehensive dataset that includes various robotic tasks and failure scenarios. Through extensive experimentation, STAR demonstrated an 86% task planning accuracy and 78% recovery success rate, showing significant improvements over baseline methods. The framework's ability to continuously learn from experience while maintaining structured knowledge representation makes it particularly suitable for long-term deployment in real-world applications.

# Fine-Grained Bias Detection in LLM: Enhancing detection mechanisms for nuanced biases 

**Authors**: Suvendu Mohanty  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06054)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs), have transformed natural language processing by improving generative capabilities. However, detecting biases embedded within these models remains a challenge. Subtle biases can propagate misinformation, influence decision-making, and reinforce stereotypes, raising ethical concerns. This study presents a detection framework to identify nuanced biases in LLMs. The approach integrates contextual analysis, interpretability via attention mechanisms, and counterfactual data augmentation to capture hidden biases across linguistic contexts. The methodology employs contrastive prompts and synthetic datasets to analyze model behaviour across cultural, ideological, and demographic scenarios.
Quantitative analysis using benchmark datasets and qualitative assessments through expert reviews validate the effectiveness of the framework. Results show improvements in detecting subtle biases compared to conventional methods, which often fail to highlight disparities in model responses to race, gender, and socio-political contexts. The framework also identifies biases arising from imbalances in training data and model architectures. Continuous user feedback ensures adaptability and refinement. This research underscores the importance of proactive bias mitigation strategies and calls for collaboration between policymakers, AI developers, and regulators. The proposed detection mechanisms enhance model transparency and support responsible LLM deployment in sensitive applications such as education, legal systems, and healthcare. Future work will focus on real-time bias monitoring and cross-linguistic generalization to improve fairness and inclusivity in AI-driven communication tools.

# DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation 

**Authors**: Runze Zhang, Guoguang Du, Xiaochuan Li, Qi Jia, Liang Jin, Lu Liu, Jingjing Wang, Cong Xu, Zhenhua Guo, Yaqian Zhao, Xiaoli Gong, Rengang Li, Baoyu Fan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06053)  

**Abstract**: Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at this https URL.

# Vairiational Stochastic Games 

**Authors**: Zhiyu Zhao, Haifeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06037)  

**Abstract**: The Control as Inference (CAI) framework has successfully transformed single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) by reframing control tasks as probabilistic inference problems. However, the extension of CAI to multi-agent, general-sum stochastic games (SGs) remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized settings where agents operate independently without centralized coordination. In this paper, we propose a novel variational inference framework tailored to decentralized multi-agent systems. Our framework addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and unaligned agent objectives, proving that the resulting policies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed decentralized algorithms. Leveraging this framework, we instantiate multiple algorithms to solve for Nash equilibrium, mean-field Nash equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium, with rigorous theoretical convergence analysis.

# Towards Universal Text-driven CT Image Segmentation 

**Authors**: Yuheng Li, Yuxiang Lai, Maria Thor, Deborah Marshall, Zachary Buchwald, David S. Yu, Xiaofeng Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06030)  

**Abstract**: Computed tomography (CT) is extensively used for accurate visualization and segmentation of organs and lesions. While deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have significantly improved CT image analysis, their performance often declines when applied to diverse, real-world clinical data. Although foundation models offer a broader and more adaptable solution, their potential is limited due to the challenge of obtaining large-scale, voxel-level annotations for medical images. In response to these challenges, prompting-based models using visual or text prompts have emerged. Visual-prompting methods, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), still require significant manual input and can introduce ambiguity when applied to clinical scenarios. Instead, foundation models that use text prompts offer a more versatile and clinically relevant approach. Notably, current text-prompt models, such as the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, are limited to text prompts already encountered during training and struggle to process the complex and diverse scenarios of real-world clinical applications. Instead of fine-tuning models trained from natural imaging, we propose OpenVocabCT, a vision-language model pretrained on large-scale 3D CT images for universal text-driven segmentation. Using the large-scale CT-RATE dataset, we decompose the diagnostic reports into fine-grained, organ-level descriptions using large language models for multi-granular contrastive learning. We evaluate our OpenVocabCT on downstream segmentation tasks across nine public datasets for organ and tumor segmentation, demonstrating the superior performance of our model compared to existing methods. All code, datasets, and models will be publicly released at this https URL.

# Zero-Shot Peg Insertion: Identifying Mating Holes and Estimating SE(2) Poses with Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Masaru Yajima, Kei Ota, Asako Kanezaki, Rei Kawakami  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06026)  

**Abstract**: Achieving zero-shot peg insertion, where inserting an arbitrary peg into an unseen hole without task-specific training, remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. This task demands a highly generalizable perception system capable of detecting potential holes, selecting the correct mating hole from multiple candidates, estimating its precise pose, and executing insertion despite uncertainties. While learning-based methods have been applied to peg insertion, they often fail to generalize beyond the specific peg-hole pairs encountered during training. Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging large-scale datasets to enable robust generalization across diverse tasks. Inspired by their success, we introduce a novel zero-shot peg insertion framework that utilizes a VLM to identify mating holes and estimate their poses without prior knowledge of their geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves 90.2% accuracy, significantly outperforming baselines in identifying the correct mating hole across a wide range of previously unseen peg-hole pairs, including 3D-printed objects, toy puzzles, and industrial connectors. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world connector insertion task on a backpanel of a PC, where our system successfully detects holes, identifies the correct mating hole, estimates its pose, and completes the insertion with a success rate of 88.3%. These results highlight the potential of VLM-driven zero-shot reasoning for enabling robust and generalizable robotic assembly.

# Towards Ambiguity-Free Spatial Foundation Model: Rethinking and Decoupling Depth Ambiguity 

**Authors**: Xiaohao Xu, Feng Xue, Xiang Li, Haowei Li, Shusheng Yang, Tianyi Zhang, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Xiaonan Huang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06014)  

**Abstract**: Depth ambiguity is a fundamental challenge in spatial scene understanding, especially in transparent scenes where single-depth estimates fail to capture full 3D structure. Existing models, limited to deterministic predictions, overlook real-world multi-layer depth. To address this, we introduce a paradigm shift from single-prediction to multi-hypothesis spatial foundation models. We first present \texttt{MD-3k}, a benchmark exposing depth biases in expert and foundational models through multi-layer spatial relationship labels and new metrics. To resolve depth ambiguity, we propose Laplacian Visual Prompting (LVP), a training-free spectral prompting technique that extracts hidden depth from pre-trained models via Laplacian-transformed RGB inputs. By integrating LVP-inferred depth with standard RGB-based estimates, our approach elicits multi-layer depth without model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of LVP in zero-shot multi-layer depth estimation, unlocking more robust and comprehensive geometry-conditioned visual generation, 3D-grounded spatial reasoning, and temporally consistent video-level depth inference. Our benchmark and code will be available at this https URL.

# Intent-Aware Self-Correction for Mitigating Social Biases in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Panatchakorn Anantaprayoon, Masahiro Kaneko, Naoaki Okazaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06011)  

**Abstract**: Self-Correction based on feedback improves the output quality of Large Language Models (LLMs). Moreover, as Self-Correction functions like the slow and conscious System-2 thinking from cognitive psychology's perspective, it can potentially reduce LLMs' social biases. LLMs are sensitive to contextual ambiguities and inconsistencies; therefore, explicitly communicating their intentions during interactions when applying Self-Correction for debiasing is crucial. In this study, we demonstrate that clarifying intentions is essential for effectively reducing biases in LLMs through Self-Correction. We divide the components needed for Self-Correction into three parts: instruction, response, and feedback, and clarify intentions at each component. We incorporate an explicit debiasing prompt to convey the intention of bias mitigation from the instruction for response generation. In the response, we use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to clarify the reasoning process. In the feedback, we define evaluation aspects necessary for debiasing and propose clear feedback through multi-aspect critiques and scoring. Through experiments, we demonstrate that self-correcting CoT responses obtained from a debiasing prompt based on multi-aspect feedback can reduce biased responses more robustly and consistently than the baselines. We also find the variation in debiasing efficacy when using models with different bias levels or separating models for response and feedback generation.

# Learning to Drive by Imitating Surrounding Vehicles 

**Authors**: Yasin Sonmez, Hanna Krasowski, Murat Arcak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05997)  

**Abstract**: Imitation learning is a promising approach for training autonomous vehicles (AV) to navigate complex traffic environments by mimicking expert driver behaviors. However, a major challenge in this paradigm lies in effectively utilizing available driving data, as collecting new data is resource-intensive and often limited in its ability to cover diverse driving scenarios. While existing imitation learning frameworks focus on leveraging expert demonstrations, they often overlook the potential of additional complex driving data from surrounding traffic participants. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation strategy that enhances imitation learning by leveraging the observed trajectories of nearby vehicles, captured through the AV's sensors, as additional expert demonstrations. We introduce a vehicle selection sampling strategy that prioritizes informative and diverse driving behaviors, contributing to a richer and more diverse dataset for training. We evaluate our approach using the state-of-the-art learning-based planning method PLUTO on the nuPlan dataset and demonstrate that our augmentation method leads to improved performance in complex driving scenarios. Specifically, our method reduces collision rates and improves safety metrics compared to the baseline. Notably, even when using only 10% of the original dataset, our method achieves performance comparable to that of the full dataset, with improved collision rates. Our findings highlight the importance of leveraging diverse real-world trajectory data in imitation learning and provide insights into data augmentation strategies for autonomous driving.

# Towards Improving Reward Design in RL: A Reward Alignment Metric for RL Practitioners 

**Authors**: Calarina Muslimani, Kerrick Johnstonbaugh, Suyog Chandramouli, Serena Booth, W. Bradley Knox, Matthew E. Taylor  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05996)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning agents are fundamentally limited by the quality of the reward functions they learn from, yet reward design is often overlooked under the assumption that a well-defined reward is readily available. However, in practice, designing rewards is difficult, and even when specified, evaluating their correctness is equally problematic: how do we know if a reward function is correctly specified? In our work, we address these challenges by focusing on reward alignment -- assessing whether a reward function accurately encodes the preferences of a human stakeholder. As a concrete measure of reward alignment, we introduce the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient to quantify the similarity between a human stakeholder's ranking of trajectory distributions and those induced by a given reward function. We show that the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient exhibits desirable properties, such as not requiring access to a ground truth reward, invariance to potential-based reward shaping, and applicability to online RL. Additionally, in an 11 -- person user study of RL practitioners, we found that access to the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient during reward selection led to statistically significant improvements. Compared to relying only on reward functions, our metric reduced cognitive workload by 1.5x, was preferred by 82% of users and increased the success rate of selecting reward functions that produced performant policies by 41%.

# GrInAdapt: Scaling Retinal Vessel Structural Map Segmentation Through Grounding, Integrating and Adapting Multi-device, Multi-site, and Multi-modal Fundus Domains 

**Authors**: Zixuan Liu, Aaron Honjaya, Yuekai Xu, Yi Zhang, Hefu Pan, Xin Wang, Linda G Shapiro, Sheng Wang, Ruikang K Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05991)  

**Abstract**: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosing ocular conditions, yet current deep learning methods are limited by modality-specific challenges and significant distribution shifts across imaging devices, resolutions, and anatomical regions. In this paper, we propose GrInAdapt, a novel framework for source-free multi-target domain adaptation that leverages multi-view images to refine segmentation labels and enhance model generalizability for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the fundus of the eye. GrInAdapt follows an intuitive three-step approach: (i) grounding images to a common anchor space via registration, (ii) integrating predictions from multiple views to achieve improved label consensus, and (iii) adapting the source model to diverse target domains. Furthermore, GrInAdapt is flexible enough to incorporate auxiliary modalities such as color fundus photography, to provide complementary cues for robust vessel segmentation. Extensive experiments on a multi-device, multi-site, and multi-modal retinal dataset demonstrate that GrInAdapt significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness across multiple domains. These results highlight the potential of GrInAdapt to advance automated retinal vessel analysis and support robust clinical decision-making.

# Black Box Causal Inference: Effect Estimation via Meta Prediction 

**Authors**: Lucius E.J. Bynum, Aahlad Manas Puli, Diego Herrero-Quevedo, Nhi Nguyen, Carlos Fernandez-Granda, Kyunghyun Cho, Rajesh Ranganath  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05985)  

**Abstract**: Causal inference and the estimation of causal effects plays a central role in decision-making across many areas, including healthcare and economics. Estimating causal effects typically requires an estimator that is tailored to each problem of interest. But developing estimators can take significant effort for even a single causal inference setting. For example, algorithms for regression-based estimators, propensity score methods, and doubly robust methods were designed across several decades to handle causal estimation with observed confounders. Similarly, several estimators have been developed to exploit instrumental variables (IVs), including two-stage least-squares (TSLS), control functions, and the method-of-moments. In this work, we instead frame causal inference as a dataset-level prediction problem, offloading algorithm design to the learning process. The approach we introduce, called black box causal inference (BBCI), builds estimators in a black-box manner by learning to predict causal effects from sampled dataset-effect pairs. We demonstrate accurate estimation of average treatment effects (ATEs) and conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) with BBCI across several causal inference problems with known identification, including problems with less developed estimators.

# SINdex: Semantic INconsistency Index for Hallucination Detection in LLMs 

**Authors**: Samir Abdaljalil, Hasan Kurban, Parichit Sharma, Erchin Serpedin, Rachad Atat  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05980)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains, yet they are prone to generating factually incorrect outputs - commonly known as "hallucinations." Among existing mitigation strategies, uncertainty-based methods are particularly attractive due to their ease of implementation, independence from external data, and compatibility with standard LLMs. In this work, we introduce a novel and scalable uncertainty-based semantic clustering framework for automated hallucination detection. Our approach leverages sentence embeddings and hierarchical clustering alongside a newly proposed inconsistency measure, SINdex, to yield more homogeneous clusters and more accurate detection of hallucination phenomena across various LLMs. Evaluations on prominent open- and closed-book QA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves AUROC improvements of up to 9.3% over state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component in our framework.

# Learning-Order Autoregressive Models with Application to Molecular Graph Generation 

**Authors**: Zhe Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Nicolas Heess, Arthur Gretton, Michalis K. Titsias  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05979)  

**Abstract**: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have become the workhorse for sequence generation tasks, since many problems can be modeled as next-token prediction. While there appears to be a natural ordering for text (i.e., left-to-right), for many data types, such as graphs, the canonical ordering is less obvious. To address this problem, we introduce a variant of ARM that generates high-dimensional data using a probabilistic ordering that is sequentially inferred from data. This model incorporates a trainable probability distribution, referred to as an \emph{order-policy}, that dynamically decides the autoregressive order in a state-dependent manner. To train the model, we introduce a variational lower bound on the exact log-likelihood, which we optimize with stochastic gradient estimation. We demonstrate experimentally that our method can learn meaningful autoregressive orderings in image and graph generation. On the challenging domain of molecular graph generation, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the QM9 and ZINC250k benchmarks, evaluated using the Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD).

# Is Your Video Language Model a Reliable Judge? 

**Authors**: Ming Liu, Wensheng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05977)  

**Abstract**: As video language models (VLMs) gain more applications in various scenarios, the need for robust and scalable evaluation of their performance becomes increasingly critical. The traditional human expert-based evaluation of VLMs has limitations in consistency and scalability, which sparked interest in automatic methods such as employing VLMs to evaluate VLMs. However, the reliability of VLMs as judges remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on a single VLM as the evaluator. However, this approach can be unreliable or biased because such a model may lack the ability to fully understand the content and may have inherent biases, ultimately compromising evaluation reliability. A remedy is to apply the principle of collective thoughts, aggregating evaluations from multiple VLMs to enhance reliability. This study investigates the efficacy of such approaches, particularly when the pool of judges includes both reliable and unreliable models. Our findings reveal that incorporating collective judgments from such a mixed pool does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the final evaluation. The inclusion of less reliable judges can introduce noise, undermining the overall reliability of the outcomes. To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we fine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved understanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable. These findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and highlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the reliability of individual models. Our study promotes the development of more reliable evaluation methods for VLMs

# Optimal sensor deception in stochastic environments with partial observability to mislead a robot to a decoy goal 

**Authors**: Hazhar Rahmani, Mukulika Ghosh, Syed Md Hasnayeen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05972)  

**Abstract**: Deception is a common strategy adapted by autonomous systems in adversarial settings. Existing deception methods primarily focus on increasing opacity or misdirecting agents away from their goal or itinerary. In this work, we propose a deception problem aiming to mislead the robot towards a decoy goal through altering sensor events under a constrained budget of alteration. The environment along with the robot's interaction with it is modeled as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), and the robot's action selection is governed by a Finite State Controller (FSC). Given a constrained budget for sensor event modifications, the objective is to compute a sensor alteration that maximizes the probability of the robot reaching a decoy goal. We establish the computational hardness of the problem by a reduction from the $0/1$ Knapsack problem and propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation to compute optimal deception strategies. We show the efficacy of our MILP formulation via a sequence of experiments.

# A Real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network-powered Wildfire Forecasting System 

**Authors**: Qijun Chen, Shaofan Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05971)  

**Abstract**: Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most dangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires may be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is mainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather conditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture levels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3) topographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area gets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to accurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and taunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a real-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that combines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical methods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise location in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information such as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small scale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation conditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities of wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing synchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in the United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural network, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to the real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to provide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$) within 24 hours ahead.

**Abstract**: The rise of generative chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) over the past two years has spurred a race to develop systems that promise near-human conversational and reasoning experiences. However, recent studies indicate that the language understanding offered by these models remains limited and far from human-like performance, particularly in grasping the contextual meanings of words, an essential aspect of reasoning. In this paper, we present a simple yet computationally efficient framework for multilingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Our approach reframes the WSD task as a cluster discrimination analysis over a semantic network refined from BabelNet using group algebra. We validate our methodology across multiple WSD benchmarks, achieving a new state of the art for all languages and tasks, as well as in individual assessments by part of speech. Notably, our model significantly surpasses the performance of current alternatives, even in low-resource languages, while reducing the parameter count by 72%.

**Authors**: Deepak Vungarala, Mohammed E. Elbtity, Sumiya Syed, Sakila Alam, Kartik Pandit, Arnob Ghosh, Ramtin Zand, Shaahin Angizi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05951)  

**Abstract**: The increasing complexity and scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) necessitate specialized tensor accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to meet various computational and energy efficiency requirements. Nevertheless, designing optimal TPU remains challenging due to the high domain expertise level, considerable manual design time, and lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. This paper introduces TPU-Gen, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based framework designed to automate the exact and approximate TPU generation process, focusing on systolic array architectures. TPU-Gen is supported with a meticulously curated, comprehensive, and open-source dataset that covers a wide range of spatial array designs and approximate multiply-and-accumulate units, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization for different DNN workloads. The proposed framework leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an effective solution for a data-scare hardware domain in building LLMs, addressing the most intriguing issue, hallucinations. TPU-Gen transforms high-level architectural specifications into optimized low-level implementations through an effective hardware generation pipeline. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance, power, and area efficiency, with an average reduction in area and power of 92\% and 96\% from the manual optimization reference values. These results set new standards for driving advancements in next-generation design automation tools powered by LLMs.

# Uncertainty Quantification From Scaling Laws in Deep Neural Networks 

**Authors**: Ibrahim Elsharkawy, Yonatan Kahn, Benjamin Hooberman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05938)  

**Abstract**: Quantifying the uncertainty from machine learning analyses is critical to their use in the physical sciences. In this work we focus on uncertainty inherited from the initialization distribution of neural networks. We compute the mean $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and variance $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}^2$ of the test loss $\mathcal{L}$ for an ensemble of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with neural tangent kernel (NTK) initialization in the infinite-width limit, and compare empirically to the results from finite-width networks for three example tasks: MNIST classification, CIFAR classification and calorimeter energy regression. We observe scaling laws as a function of training set size $N_\mathcal{D}$ for both $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ and $\sigma_{\mathcal{L}}$, but find that the coefficient of variation $\epsilon_{\mathcal{L}} \equiv \sigma_{\mathcal{L}}/\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ becomes independent of $N_\mathcal{D}$ at both infinite and finite width for sufficiently large $N_\mathcal{D}$. This implies that the coefficient of variation of a finite-width network may be approximated by its infinite-width value, and may in principle be calculable using finite-width perturbation theory.

# The Unified Control Framework: Establishing a Common Foundation for Enterprise AI Governance, Risk Management and Regulatory Compliance 

**Authors**: Ian W. Eisenberg, Lucía Gamboa, Eli Sherman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05937)  

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of AI systems presents enterprises with a dual challenge: accelerating innovation while ensuring responsible governance. Current AI governance approaches suffer from fragmentation, with risk management frameworks that focus on isolated domains, regulations that vary across jurisdictions despite conceptual alignment, and high-level standards lacking concrete implementation guidance. This fragmentation increases governance costs and creates a false dichotomy between innovation and responsibility. We propose the Unified Control Framework (UCF): a comprehensive governance approach that integrates risk management and regulatory compliance through a unified set of controls. The UCF consists of three key components: (1) a comprehensive risk taxonomy synthesizing organizational and societal risks, (2) structured policy requirements derived from regulations, and (3) a parsimonious set of 42 controls that simultaneously address multiple risk scenarios and compliance requirements. We validate the UCF by mapping it to the Colorado AI Act, demonstrating how our approach enables efficient, adaptable governance that scales across regulations while providing concrete implementation guidance. The UCF reduces duplication of effort, ensures comprehensive coverage, and provides a foundation for automation, enabling organizations to achieve responsible AI governance without sacrificing innovation speed.

# Audio-to-Image Encoding for Improved Voice Characteristic Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks 

**Authors**: Youness Atif  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05929)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel audio-to-image encoding framework that integrates multiple dimensions of voice characteristics into a single RGB image for speaker recognition. In this method, the green channel encodes raw audio data, the red channel embeds statistical descriptors of the voice signal (including key metrics such as median and mean values for fundamental frequency, spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff, zero-crossing rate, MFCCs, RMS energy, spectral flatness, spectral contrast, chroma, and harmonic-to-noise ratio), and the blue channel comprises subframes representing these features in a spatially organized format. A deep convolutional neural network trained on these composite images achieves 98% accuracy in speaker classification across two speakers, suggesting that this integrated multi-channel representation can provide a more discriminative input for voice recognition tasks.

# ElementaryNet: A Non-Strategic Neural Network for Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games 

**Authors**: Greg d'Eon, Hala Murad, Kevin Leyton-Brown, James R. Wright  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05925)  

**Abstract**: Models of human behavior in game-theoretic settings often distinguish between strategic behavior, in which a player both reasons about how others will act and best responds to these beliefs, and "level-0" non-strategic behavior, in which they do not respond to explicit beliefs about others. The state of the art for predicting human behavior on unrepeated simultaneous-move games is GameNet, a neural network that learns extremely complex level-0 specifications from data. The current paper makes three contributions. First, it shows that GameNet's level-0 specifications are too powerful, because they are capable of strategic reasoning. Second, it introduces a novel neural network architecture (dubbed ElementaryNet) and proves that it is only capable of nonstrategic behavior. Third, it describes an extensive experimental evaluation of ElementaryNet. Our overall findings are that (1) ElementaryNet dramatically underperforms GameNet when neither model is allowed to explicitly model higher level agents who best-respond to the model's predictions, indicating that good performance on our dataset requires a model capable of strategic reasoning; (2) that the two models achieve statistically indistinguishable performance when such higher-level agents are introduced, meaning that ElementaryNet's restriction to a non-strategic level-0 specification does not degrade model performance; and (3) that this continues to hold even when ElementaryNet is restricted to a set of level-0 building blocks previously introduced in the literature, with only the functional form being learned by the neural network.

# IDEA Prune: An Integrated Enlarge-and-Prune Pipeline in Generative Language Model Pretraining 

**Authors**: Yixiao Li, Xianzhi Du, Ajay Jaiswal, Tao Lei, Tuo Zhao, Chong Wang, Jianyu Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05920)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models have intensified the need for efficient and deployable models within limited inference budgets. Structured pruning pipelines have shown promise in token efficiency compared to training target-size models from scratch. In this paper, we advocate incorporating enlarged model pretraining, which is often ignored in previous works, into pruning. We study the enlarge-and-prune pipeline as an integrated system to address two critical questions: whether it is worth pretraining an enlarged model even when the model is never deployed, and how to optimize the entire pipeline for better pruned models. We propose an integrated enlarge-and-prune pipeline, which combines enlarge model training, pruning, and recovery under a single cosine annealing learning rate schedule. This approach is further complemented by a novel iterative structured pruning method for gradual parameter removal. The proposed method helps to mitigate the knowledge loss caused by the rising learning rate in naive enlarge-and-prune pipelines and enable effective redistribution of model capacity among surviving neurons, facilitating smooth compression and enhanced performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments on compressing 2.8B models to 1.3B with up to 2T tokens in pretraining. It demonstrates the integrated approach not only provides insights into the token efficiency of enlarged model pretraining but also achieves superior performance of pruned models.

# SAS: Segment Anything Small for Ultrasound -- A Non-Generative Data Augmentation Technique for Robust Deep Learning in Ultrasound Imaging 

**Authors**: Danielle L. Ferreira, Ahana Gangopadhyay, Hsi-Ming Chang, Ravi Soni, Gopal Avinash  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05916)  

**Abstract**: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound (US) images, particularly small ones, is challenging due to noise and variability in imaging conditions (e.g., probe position, patient anatomy, tissue characteristics and pathology). To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a simple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting small anatomical structures in ultrasound images. SAS employs a dual transformation strategy: (1) simulating diverse organ scales by resizing and embedding organ thumbnails into a black background, and (2) injecting noise into regions of interest to simulate varying tissue textures. These transformations generate realistic and diverse training data without introducing hallucinations or artifacts, improving the model's robustness to noise and variability. We fine-tuned a promptable foundation model on a controlled organ-specific medical imaging dataset and evaluated its performance on one internal and five external datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score gains of up to 0.35 and an average improvement of 0.16 [95% CI 0.132,0.188]. Additionally, our iterative point prompts provide precise control and adaptive refinement, achieving performance comparable to bounding box prompts with just two points. SAS enhances model robustness and generalizability across diverse anatomical structures and imaging conditions, particularly for small structures, without compromising the accuracy of larger ones. By offering a computationally efficient solution that eliminates the need for extensive human labeling efforts, SAS emerges as a powerful tool for advancing medical image analysis, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

# Towards Understanding the Use of MLLM-Enabled Applications for Visual Interpretation by Blind and Low Vision People 

**Authors**: Ricardo E. Gonzalez Penuela, Ruiying Hu, Sharon Lin, Tanisha Shende, Shiri Azenkot  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05899)  

**Abstract**: Blind and Low Vision (BLV) people have adopted AI-powered visual interpretation applications to address their daily needs. While these applications have been helpful, prior work has found that users remain unsatisfied by their frequent errors. Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications, and they show promise for more descriptive visual interpretations. However, it is still unknown how this advancement has changed people's use of these applications. To address this gap, we conducted a two-week diary study in which 20 BLV people used an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application we developed, and we collected 553 entries. In this paper, we report a preliminary analysis of 60 diary entries from 6 participants. We found that participants considered the application's visual interpretations trustworthy (mean 3.75 out of 5) and satisfying (mean 4.15 out of 5). Moreover, participants trusted our application in high-stakes scenarios, such as receiving medical dosage advice. We discuss our plan to complete our analysis to inform the design of future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation systems.

# Zero-shot Medical Event Prediction Using a Generative Pre-trained Transformer on Electronic Health Records 

**Authors**: Ekaterina Redekop, Zichen Wang, Rushikesh Kulkarni, Mara Pleasure, Aaron Chin, Hamid Reza Hassanzadeh, Brian L. Hill, Melika Emami, William Speier, Corey W. Arnold  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05893)  

**Abstract**: Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Foundational models, such as generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models enhances task-specific performance, it is costly, complex, and unsustainable for every target. We show that a foundation model trained on EHRs can perform predictive tasks in a zero-shot manner, eliminating the need for fine-tuning.
This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.
Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.
We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings.

# QG-SMS: Enhancing Test Item Analysis via Student Modeling and Simulation 

**Authors**: Bang Nguyen, Tingting Du, Mengxia Yu, Lawrence Angrave, Meng Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05888)  

**Abstract**: While the Question Generation (QG) task has been increasingly adopted in educational assessments, its evaluation remains limited by approaches that lack a clear connection to the educational values of test items. In this work, we introduce test item analysis, a method frequently used by educators to assess test question quality, into QG evaluation. Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis. As demonstrated in our extensive experiments and human evaluation study, the additional perspectives introduced by the simulated student profiles lead to a more effective and robust assessment of test items.

# Benchmarking AI Models in Software Engineering: A Review, Search Tool, and Enhancement Protocol 

**Authors**: Roham Koohestani, Philippe de Bekker, Maliheh Izadi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05860)  

**Abstract**: Benchmarks are essential for consistent evaluation and reproducibility. The integration of Artificial Intelligence into Software Engineering (AI4SE) has given rise to numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug fixing. However, this surge presents challenges: (1) scattered benchmark knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting relevant benchmarks, (3) the absence of a uniform standard for benchmark development, and (4) limitations of existing benchmarks. In this paper, we review 173 studies and identify 204 AI4SE benchmarks. We classify these benchmarks, analyze their limitations, and expose gaps in practices. Based on our review, we created BenchScout, a semantic search tool to find relevant benchmarks, using automated clustering of the contexts from associated studies. We conducted a user study with 22 participants to evaluate BenchScout's usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness which resulted in average scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5. To advance benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified method to enhance benchmark quality. As a case study, we applied BenchFrame to the HumanEval benchmark and addressed its main limitations. This led to HumanEvalNext, featuring (1) corrected errors, (2) improved language conversion, (3) expanded test coverage, and (4) increased difficulty. We then evaluated ten state-of-the-art code language models on HumanEval, HumanEvalPlus, and HumanEvalNext. On HumanEvalNext, models showed a pass@1 score reduction of 31.22% and 19.94% compared to HumanEval and HumanEvalPlus, respectively.

# Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition 

**Authors**: Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua D. Reiss  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05858)  

**Abstract**: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

# SYMBIOSIS: Systems Thinking and Machine Intelligence for Better Outcomes in Society 

**Authors**: Sameer Sethi, Donald Martin Jr., Emmanuel Klu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05857)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents SYMBIOSIS, an AI-powered framework and platform designed to make Systems Thinking accessible for addressing societal challenges and unlock paths for leveraging systems thinking frameworks to improve AI systems. The platform establishes a centralized, open-source repository of systems thinking/system dynamics models categorized by Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and societal topics using topic modeling and classification techniques. Systems Thinking resources, though critical for articulating causal theories in complex problem spaces, are often locked behind specialized tools and intricate notations, creating high barriers to entry. To address this, we developed a generative co-pilot that translates complex systems representations - such as causal loop and stock-flow diagrams - into natural language (and vice-versa), allowing users to explore and build models without extensive technical training.
Rooted in community-based system dynamics (CBSD) and informed by community-driven insights on societal context, we aim to bridge the problem understanding chasm. This gap, driven by epistemic uncertainty, often limits ML developers who lack the community-specific knowledge essential for problem understanding and formulation, often leading to ill informed causal assumptions, reduced intervention effectiveness and harmful biases. Recent research identifies causal and abductive reasoning as crucial frontiers for AI, and Systems Thinking provides a naturally compatible framework for both. By making Systems Thinking frameworks more accessible and user-friendly, SYMBIOSIS aims to serve as a foundational step to unlock future research into responsible and society-centered AI. Our work underscores the need for ongoing research into AI's capacity to understand essential characteristics of complex adaptive systems paving the way for more socially attuned, effective AI systems.

# This Is Your Doge, If It Please You: Exploring Deception and Robustness in Mixture of LLMs 

**Authors**: Lorenz Wolf, Sangwoong Yoon, Ilija Bogunovic  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05856)  

**Abstract**: Mixture of large language model (LLMs) Agents (MoA) architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks like AlpacaEval 2.0 by leveraging the collaboration of multiple LLMs at inference time. Despite these successes, an evaluation of the safety and reliability of MoA is missing. We present the first comprehensive study of MoA's robustness against deceptive LLM agents that deliberately provide misleading responses. We examine factors like the propagation of deceptive information, model size, and information availability, and uncover critical vulnerabilities. On AlpacaEval 2.0, the popular LLaMA 3.1-70B model achieves a length-controlled Win Rate (LC WR) of 49.2% when coupled with 3-layer MoA (6 LLM agents). However, we demonstrate that introducing only a $\textit{single}$ carefully-instructed deceptive agent into the MoA can reduce performance to 37.9%, effectively nullifying all MoA gains. On QuALITY, a multiple-choice comprehension task, the impact is also severe, with accuracy plummeting by a staggering 48.5%. Inspired in part by the historical Doge of Venice voting process, designed to minimize influence and deception, we propose a range of unsupervised defense mechanisms that recover most of the lost performance.

# Accelerating Earth Science Discovery via Multi-Agent LLM Systems 

**Authors**: Dmitrii Pantiukhin, Boris Shapkin, Ivan Kuznetsov, Antonia Anna Jost, Nikolay Koldunov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05854)  

**Abstract**: This Perspective explores the transformative potential of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the geosciences. Users of geoscientific data repositories face challenges due to the complexity and diversity of data formats, inconsistent metadata practices, and a considerable number of unprocessed datasets. MAS possesses transformative potential for improving scientists' interaction with geoscientific data by enabling intelligent data processing, natural language interfaces, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities. We illustrate this approach with "PANGAEA GPT", a specialized MAS pipeline integrated with the diverse PANGAEA database for Earth and Environmental Science, demonstrating how MAS-driven workflows can effectively manage complex datasets and accelerate scientific discovery. We discuss how MAS can address current data challenges in geosciences, highlight advancements in other scientific fields, and propose future directions for integrating MAS into geoscientific data processing pipelines. In this Perspective, we show how MAS can fundamentally improve data accessibility, promote cross-disciplinary collaboration, and accelerate geoscientific discoveries.

# Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation: INFINITE Methodology for Defining the Inference Index 

**Authors**: Nicholas Christakis, Dimitris Drikakis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05852)  

**Abstract**: This study introduces a new methodology for an Inference Index (InI), called INFerence INdex In Testing model Effectiveness methodology (INFINITE), aiming to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. The InI index provides a comprehensive assessment focusing on three key components: efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. This approach encapsulates time-based efficiency, response quality, and the stability of model outputs, offering a thorough understanding of LLM performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics. We applied this methodology to compare OpenAI's GPT-4o (GPT), OpenAI-o1 pro (OAI1), and OpenAI-o3 mini-high (OAI3) in generating Python code for the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model to forecast meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Our findings demonstrate that GPT outperforms OAI1 and performs comparably to OAI3 regarding accuracy and workflow efficiency. The study reveals that LLM-assisted code generation can produce results similar to expert-designed models with effective prompting and refinement. GPT's performance advantage highlights the benefits of widespread use and user feedback.

# Extracting and Emulsifying Cultural Explanation to Improve Multilingual Capability of LLMs 

**Authors**: Hamin Koo, Jaehyung Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05846)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their English-centric training data limits performance in non-English languages, highlighting the need for enhancements in their multilingual capabilities. While some work on multilingual prompting methods handles non-English queries by utilizing English translations or restructuring them to more closely align with LLM reasoning patterns, these works often overlook the importance of cultural context, limiting their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose EMCEI, a simple yet effective approach that improves LLMs' multilingual capabilities by incorporating cultural context for more accurate and appropriate responses. Specifically, EMCEI follows a two-step process that first extracts relevant cultural context from the LLM's parametric knowledge via prompting. Then, EMCEI employs an LLM-as-Judge mechanism to select the most appropriate response by balancing cultural relevance and reasoning ability. Experiments on diverse multilingual benchmarks show that EMCEI outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling multilingual queries with LLMs.

# Machine Learned Force Fields: Fundamentals, its reach, and challenges 

**Authors**: Carlos A. Vital, Román J. Armenta-Rico, Huziel E. Sauceda  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05845)  

**Abstract**: Highly accurate force fields are a mandatory requirement to generate predictive simulations. In this regard, Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach in computational chemistry and materials science, combining the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods with computational efficiency orders of magnitude superior to ab-initio methods. This chapter provides an introduction of the fundamentals of learning and how it is applied to construct MLFFs, detailing key methodologies such as neural network potentials and kernel-based models. Emphasis is placed on the construction of SchNet model, as one of the most elemental neural network-based force fields that are nowadays the basis of modern architectures. Additionally, the GDML framework is described in detail as an example of how the elegant formulation of kernel methods can be used to construct mathematically robust and physics-inspired MLFFs. The ongoing advancements in MLFF development continue to expand their applicability, enabling precise simulations of large and complex systems that were previously beyond reach. This chapter concludes by highlighting the transformative impact of MLFFs on scientific research, underscoring their role in driving future discoveries in the fields of chemistry, physics, and materials science.

# AI-Facilitated Collective Judgements 

**Authors**: Manon Revel, Théophile Pénigaud  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05830)  

**Abstract**: This article unpacks the design choices behind longstanding and newly proposed computational frameworks aimed at finding common grounds across collective preferences and examines their potential future impacts, both technically and normatively. It begins by situating AI-assisted preference elicitation within the historical role of opinion polls, emphasizing that preferences are shaped by the decision-making context and are seldom objectively captured. With that caveat in mind, we explore AI-facilitated collective judgment as a discovery tool for fostering reasonable representations of a collective will, sense-making, and agreement-seeking. At the same time, we caution against dangerously misguided uses, such as enabling binding decisions, fostering gradual disempowerment or post-rationalizing political outcomes.

# The impact of AI and peer feedback on research writing skills: a study using the CGScholar platform among Kazakhstani scholars 

**Authors**: Raigul Zheldibayeva  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05820)  

**Abstract**: This research studies the impact of AI and peer feedback on the academic writing development of Kazakhstani scholars using the CGScholar platform - a product of research into collaborative learning, big data, and artificial intelligence developed by educators and computer scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The study aimed to find out how familiarity with AI tools and peer feedback processes impacts participants' openness to incorporating feedback into their academic writing. The study involved 36 scholars enrolled in a scientific internship focused on education at UIUC. A survey with 15 multiple-choice questions, a Likert scale, and open-ended questions was used to collect data. The survey was conducted via Google Forms in both English and Russian to ensure linguistic accessibility. Demographic information such as age, gender, and first language was collected to provide a detailed understanding of the data. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between familiarity with AI tools and openness to making changes based on feedback, and a strong positive correlation between research writing experience and expectations of peer feedback, especially in the area of research methodology. These results show that participants are open-minded to AI-assisted feedback; however, they still highly appreciate peer input, especially regarding methodological guidance. This study demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating AI tools with traditional feedback mechanisms to improve research writing quality in academic settings.

# Will Neural Scaling Laws Activate Jevons' Paradox in AI Labor Markets? A Time-Varying Elasticity of Substitution (VES) Analysis 

**Authors**: Rajesh P. Narayanan, R. Kelley Pace  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05816)  

**Abstract**: AI industry leaders often use the term ``Jevons' Paradox.'' We explore the significance of this term for artificial intelligence adoption through a time-varying elasticity of substitution framework. We develop a model connecting AI development to labor substitution through four key mechanisms: (1) increased effective computational capacity from both hardware and algorithmic improvements; (2) AI capabilities that rise logarithmically with computation following established neural scaling laws; (3) declining marginal computational costs leading to lower AI prices through competitive pressure; and (4) a resulting increase in the elasticity of substitution between AI and human labor over time. Our time-varying elasticity of substitution (VES) framework, incorporating the Gørtz identity, yields analytical conditions for market transformation dynamics. This work provides a simple framework to help assess the economic reasoning behind industry claims that AI will increasingly substitute for human labor across diverse economic sectors.

**Authors**: Risa Palm, Justin Kingsland, Toby Bolsen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05815)  

**Abstract**: A large survey of American adults explored the complex landscape of attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). It explored the degree of concern regarding specific potential outcomes of the new advances in AI technology and correlates of these concerns. Key variables associated with the direction and intensity of concern include prior experience using a large language model such as ChatGPT, general trust in science, adherence to the precautionary principle versus support for unrestricted innovation, and demographic factors such as gender. By analyzing these relationships, the paper provides valuable insights into the American public's response to AI that are particularly important in the development of policy to regulate or further encourage its development.

**Authors**: Deepika Raman, Nada Madkour, Evan R. Murphy, Krystal Jackson, Jessica Newman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05812)  

**Abstract**: Frontier AI models -- highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge of AI development -- may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights, economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks could arise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascading effects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models.
In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AI industry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27 nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define these thresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine and disclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unless adequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.''
To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, we outline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, not perfect'' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AI capabilities and consequently evolving risks. We also propose specific threshold recommendations, including some detailed case studies, for a subset of risks across eight risk categories: (1) Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Weapons, (2) Cyber Attacks, (3) Model Autonomy, (4) Persuasion and Manipulation, (5) Deception, (6) Toxicity, (7) Discrimination, and (8) Socioeconomic Disruption. Our goal is to serve as a starting point or supplementary resource for policymakers and industry leaders, encouraging proactive risk management that prioritizes preventing intolerable risks (ex ante) rather than merely mitigating them after they occur (ex post).

# A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Reaction Products from Generic Templates 

**Authors**: Derin Ozer, Sylvain Lamprier, Thomas Cauchy, Nicolas Gutowski, Benoit Da Mota  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05810)  

**Abstract**: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.

# Multi-agent Auto-Bidding with Latent Graph Diffusion Models 

**Authors**: Dom Huh, Prasant Mohapatra  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05805)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.

# Holistically Evaluating the Environmental Impact of Creating Language Models 

**Authors**: Jacob Morrison, Clara Na, Jared Fernandez, Tim Dettmers, Emma Strubell, Jesse Dodge  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05804)  

**Abstract**: As the performance of artificial intelligence systems has dramatically increased, so too has the environmental impact of creating these systems. While many model developers release estimates of the power consumption and carbon emissions from the final training runs for their latest models, there is comparatively little transparency into the impact of model development, hardware manufacturing, and total water usage throughout. In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released 493 metric tons of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed 2.769 million liters of water, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to ~50% of that of training. By looking at detailed time series data for power consumption, we also find that power usage throughout training is not consistent, fluctuating between ~15% and ~85% of our hardware's maximum power draw, with negative implications for grid-scale planning as demand continues to grow. We close with a discussion on the continued difficulty of estimating the environmental impact of AI systems, and key takeaways for model developers and the public at large.

# Federated Learning Framework via Distributed Mutual Learning 

**Authors**: Yash Gupta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05803)  

**Abstract**: Federated Learning often relies on sharing full or partial model weights, which can burden network bandwidth and raise privacy risks. We present a loss-based alternative using distributed mutual learning. Instead of transmitting weights, clients periodically share their loss predictions on a public test set. Each client then refines its model by combining its local loss with the average Kullback-Leibler divergence over losses from other clients. This collaborative approach both reduces transmission overhead and preserves data privacy. Experiments on a face mask detection task demonstrate that our method outperforms weight-sharing baselines, achieving higher accuracy on unseen data while providing stronger generalization and privacy benefits.

# Illuminant and light direction estimation using Wasserstein distance method 

**Authors**: Selcuk Yazar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05802)  

**Abstract**: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.

# Fault Localization and State Estimation of Power Grid under Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks 

**Authors**: Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05797)  

**Abstract**: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.

# Towards Multi-Stakeholder Evaluation of ML Models: A Crowdsourcing Study on Metric Preferences in Job-matching System 

**Authors**: Takuya Yokota, Yuri Nakao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05796)  

**Abstract**: While machine learning (ML) technology affects diverse stakeholders, there is no one-size-fits-all metric to evaluate the quality of outputs, including performance and fairness. Using predetermined metrics without soliciting stakeholder opinions is problematic because it leads to an unfair disregard for stakeholders in the ML pipeline. In this study, to establish practical ways to incorporate diverse stakeholder opinions into the selection of metrics for ML, we investigate participants' preferences for different metrics by using crowdsourcing. We ask 837 participants to choose a better model from two hypothetical ML models in a hypothetical job-matching system twenty times and calculate their utility values for seven metrics. To examine the participants' feedback in detail, we divide them into five clusters based on their utility values and analyze the tendencies of each cluster, including their preferences for metrics and common attributes. Based on the results, we discuss the points that should be considered when selecting appropriate metrics and evaluating ML models with multiple stakeholders.

# CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking 

**Authors**: Yiming Li, Kaiying Yan, Shuo Shao, Tongqing Zhai, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhan Qin, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05794)  

**Abstract**: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks. The code for reproducing main experiments is available at this https URL

# MedSimAI: Simulation and Formative Feedback Generation to Enhance Deliberate Practice in Medical Education 

**Authors**: Yann Hicke, Jadon Geathers, Niroop Rajashekar, Colleen Chan, Anyanate Gwendolyne Jack, Justin Sewell, Mackenzi Preston, Susannah Cornes, Dennis Shung, Rene Kizilcec  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05793)  

**Abstract**: Medical education faces challenges in scalability, accessibility, and consistency, particularly in clinical skills training for physician-patient communication. Traditional simulation-based learning, while effective, is resource-intensive, difficult to schedule, and often highly variable in feedback quality. Through a collaboration between AI, learning science, and medical education experts, we co-developed MedSimAI, an AI-powered simulation platform that enables deliberate practice, self-regulated learning (SRL), and automated assessment through interactive patient encounters. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), MedSimAI generates realistic clinical interactions and provides immediate, structured feedback using established medical evaluation frameworks such as the Master Interview Rating Scale (MIRS). In a pilot study with 104 first-year medical students, we examined engagement, conversation patterns, and user perceptions. Students found MedSimAI beneficial for repeated, realistic patient-history practice. Conversation analysis revealed that certain higher-order skills were often overlooked, though students generally performed systematic histories and empathic listening. By integrating unlimited practice opportunities, real-time AI assessment, and SRL principles, MedSimAI addresses key limitations of traditional simulation-based training, making high-quality clinical education more accessible and scalable.

# Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models: A Survey 

**Authors**: Leonardo Berti, Flavio Giorgi, Gjergji Kasneci  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05788)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are leading a new technological revolution as one of the most promising research streams toward artificial general intelligence. The scaling of these models, accomplished by increasing the number of parameters and the magnitude of the training datasets, has been linked to various so-called emergent abilities that were previously unobserved. These emergent abilities, ranging from advanced reasoning and in-context learning to coding and problem-solving, have sparked an intense scientific debate: Are they truly emergent, or do they simply depend on external factors, such as training dynamics, the type of problems, or the chosen metric? What underlying mechanism causes them? Despite their transformative potential, emergent abilities remain poorly understood, leading to misconceptions about their definition, nature, predictability, and implications. In this work, we shed light on emergent abilities by conducting a comprehensive review of the phenomenon, addressing both its scientific underpinnings and real-world consequences. We first critically analyze existing definitions, exposing inconsistencies in conceptualizing emergent abilities. We then explore the conditions under which these abilities appear, evaluating the role of scaling laws, task complexity, pre-training loss, quantization, and prompting strategies. Our review extends beyond traditional LLMs and includes Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which leverage reinforcement learning and inference-time search to amplify reasoning and self-reflection. However, emergence is not inherently positive. As AI systems gain autonomous reasoning capabilities, they also develop harmful behaviors, including deception, manipulation, and reward hacking. We highlight growing concerns about safety and governance, emphasizing the need for better evaluation frameworks and regulatory oversight.

# Artificial Intelligence in Sports: Insights from a Quantitative Survey among Sports Students in Germany about their Perceptions, Expectations, and Concerns regarding the Use of AI Tools 

**Authors**: Dennis Krämer, Anja Bosold, Martin Minarik, Cleo Schyvinck, Andre Hajek  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05785)  

**Abstract**: Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT, Copilot, or Gemini have a crucial impact on academic research and teaching. Empirical data on how students perceive the increasing influence of AI, which different types of tools they use, what they expect from them in their daily academic tasks, and their concerns regarding the use of AI in their studies are still limited. The manuscript presents findings from a quantitative survey conducted among sports students of all semesters in Germany using an online questionnaire. It explores aspects such as students' usage behavior, motivational factors, and uncertainties regarding the impact of AI tools on academia in the future. Furthermore, the social climate in sports studies is being investigated to provide a general overview of the current situation of the students in Germany. Data collection took place between August and November 2023, addressing all sports departments at German universities, with a total of 262 students participating. Our Findings indicate that students have a strong interest in using AI tools in their studies, expecting them to improve their overall academic performance, understand the complexity of scientific approaches, and save time. They express confidence that the proliferation of AI will not compromise their critical thinking skills. Moreover, students are positive about integrating more AI-related topics into the curriculum and about lecturers adopting more AI-based teaching methods. However, our findings also show that students have concerns about plagiarism, lecturer preparedness and their own skills and future skill development.

# The Illusion of Rights based AI Regulation 

**Authors**: Yiyang Mei, Matthew Sag  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05784)  

**Abstract**: Whether and how to regulate AI is one of the defining questions of our times - a question that is being debated locally, nationally, and internationally. We argue that much of this debate is proceeding on a false premise. Specifically, our article challenges the prevailing academic consensus that the European Union's AI regulatory framework is fundamentally rights-driven and the correlative presumption that other rights-regarding nations should therefore follow Europe's lead in AI regulation. Rather than taking rights language in EU rules and regulations at face value, we show how EU AI regulation is the logical outgrowth of a particular cultural, political, and historical context. We show that although instruments like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the AI Act invoke the language of fundamental rights, these rights are instrumentalized - used as rhetorical cover for governance tools that address systemic risks and maintain institutional stability. As such, we reject claims that the EU's regulatory framework and the substance of its rules should be adopted as universal imperatives and transplanted to other liberal democracies. To add weight to our argument from historical context, we conduct a comparative analysis of AI regulation in five contested domains: data privacy, cybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and misinformation. This EU-US comparison shows that the EU's regulatory architecture is not meaningfully rights-based. Our article's key intervention in AI policy debates is not to suggest that the current American regulatory model is necessarily preferable but that the presumed legitimacy of the EU's AI regulatory approach must be abandoned.

# Knowledge representation and scalable abstract reasoning for simulated democracy in Unity 

**Authors**: Eleftheria Katsiri, Alexandros Gazis, Angelos Protopapas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05783)  

**Abstract**: We present a novel form of scalable knowledge representation about agents in a simulated democracy, e-polis, where real users respond to social challenges associated with democratic institutions, structured as Smart Spatial Types, a new type of Smart Building that changes architectural form according to the philosophical doctrine of a visitor. At the end of the game players vote on the Smart City that results from their collective choices. Our approach uses deductive systems in an unusual way: by integrating a model of democracy with a model of a Smart City we are able to prove quality aspects of the simulated democracy in different urban and social settings, while adding ease and flexibility to the development. Second, we can infer and reason with abstract knowledge, which is a limitation of the Unity platform; third, our system enables real-time decision-making and adaptation of the game flow based on the player's abstract state, paving the road to explainability. Scalability is achieved by maintaining a dual-layer knowledge representation mechanism for reasoning about the simulated democracy that functions in a similar way to a two-level cache. The lower layer knows about the current state of the game by continually processing a high rate of events produced by the in-built physics engine of the Unity platform, e.g., it knows of the position of a player in space, in terms of his coordinates x,y,z as well as their choices for each challenge. The higher layer knows of easily-retrievable, user-defined abstract knowledge about current and historical states, e.g., it knows of the political doctrine of a Smart Spatial Type, a player's philosophical doctrine, and the collective philosophical doctrine of a community players with respect to current social issues.

# AI Mentors for Student Projects: Spotting Early Issues in Computer Science Proposals 

**Authors**: Gati Aher, Robin Schmucker, Tom Mitchell, Zachary C. Lipton  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05782)  

**Abstract**: When executed well, project-based learning (PBL) engages students' intrinsic motivation, encourages students to learn far beyond a course's limited curriculum, and prepares students to think critically and maturely about the skills and tools at their disposal. However, educators experience mixed results when using PBL in their classrooms: some students thrive with minimal guidance and others flounder. Early evaluation of project proposals could help educators determine which students need more support, yet evaluating project proposals and student aptitude is time-consuming and difficult to scale. In this work, we design, implement, and conduct an initial user study (n = 36) for a software system that collects project proposals and aptitude information to support educators in determining whether a student is ready to engage with PBL. We find that (1) users perceived the system as helpful for writing project proposals and identifying tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) educator ratings indicate that users with less technical experience in the project topic tend to write lower-quality project proposals, and (3) GPT-4o's ratings show agreement with educator ratings. While the prospect of using LLMs to rate the quality of students' project proposals is promising, its long-term effectiveness strongly hinges on future efforts at characterizing indicators that reliably predict students' success and motivation to learn.

# Homomorphic Encryption of Intuitionistic Logic Proofs and Functional Programs: A Categorical Approach Inspired by Composite-Order Bilinear Groups 

**Authors**: Ben Goertzel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05779)  

**Abstract**: We present a conceptual framework for extending homomorphic encryption beyond arithmetic or Boolean operations into the domain of intuitionistic logic proofs and, by the Curry-Howard correspondence, into the domain of typed functional programs. We begin by reviewing well-known homomorphic encryption schemes for arithmetic operations, and then discuss the adaptation of similar concepts to support logical inference steps in intuitionistic logic. Key to our construction are polynomial functors and Bounded Natural Functors (BNFs), which serve as a categorical substrate on which logic formulas and proofs are represented and manipulated. We outline a complexity-theoretic hardness assumption -- the BNF Distinguishing Problem, constructed via a reduction from Subgraph Isomorphism, providing a foundation for cryptographic security. Finally, we describe how these methods can homomorphically encode the execution of total, dependently typed functional programs, and outline strategies for making the approach potentially efficient, including software optimizations and hardware acceleration.

# DreamNet: A Multimodal Framework for Semantic and Emotional Analysis of Sleep Narratives 

**Authors**: Tapasvi Panchagnula  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05778)  

**Abstract**: Dream narratives provide a unique window into human cognition and emotion, yet their systematic analysis using artificial intelligence has been underexplored. We introduce DreamNet, a novel deep learning framework that decodes semantic themes and emotional states from textual dream reports, optionally enhanced with REM-stage EEG data. Leveraging a transformer-based architecture with multimodal attention, DreamNet achieves 92.1% accuracy and 88.4% F1-score in text-only mode (DNet-T) on a curated dataset of 1,500 anonymized dream narratives, improving to 99.0% accuracy and 95.2% F1-score with EEG integration (DNet-M). Strong dream-emotion correlations (e.g., falling-anxiety, r = 0.91, p < 0.01) highlight its potential for mental health diagnostics, cognitive science, and personalized therapy. This work provides a scalable tool, a publicly available enriched dataset, and a rigorous methodology, bridging AI and psychological research.

# Medical Hallucinations in Foundation Models and Their Impact on Healthcare 

**Authors**: Yubin Kim, Hyewon Jeong, Shan Chen, Shuyue Stella Li, Mingyu Lu, Kumail Alhamoud, Jimin Mun, Cristina Grau, Minseok Jung, Rodrigo Gameiro, Lizhou Fan, Eugene Park, Tristan Lin, Joonsik Yoon, Wonjin Yoon, Maarten Sap, Yulia Tsvetkov, Paul Liang, Xuhai Xu, Xin Liu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Hae Won Park, Samir Tulebaev, Cynthia Breazeal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05777)  

**Abstract**: Foundation Models that are capable of processing and generating multi-modal data have transformed AI's role in medicine. However, a key limitation of their reliability is hallucination, where inaccurate or fabricated information can impact clinical decisions and patient safety. We define medical hallucination as any instance in which a model generates misleading medical content. This paper examines the unique characteristics, causes, and implications of medical hallucinations, with a particular focus on how these errors manifest themselves in real-world clinical scenarios. Our contributions include (1) a taxonomy for understanding and addressing medical hallucinations, (2) benchmarking models using medical hallucination dataset and physician-annotated LLM responses to real medical cases, providing direct insight into the clinical impact of hallucinations, and (3) a multi-national clinician survey on their experiences with medical hallucinations. Our results reveal that inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Search Augmented Generation can effectively reduce hallucination rates. However, despite these improvements, non-trivial levels of hallucination persist. These findings underscore the ethical and practical imperative for robust detection and mitigation strategies, establishing a foundation for regulatory policies that prioritize patient safety and maintain clinical integrity as AI becomes more integrated into healthcare. The feedback from clinicians highlights the urgent need for not only technical advances but also for clearer ethical and regulatory guidelines to ensure patient safety. A repository organizing the paper resources, summaries, and additional information is available at this https URL hallucination.

# FAA-CLIP: Federated Adversarial Adaptation of CLIP 

**Authors**: Yihang Wu, Ahmad Chaddad, Christian Desrosiers, Tareef Daqqaq, Reem Kateb  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05776)  

**Abstract**: Despite the remarkable performance of vision language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), the large size of these models is a considerable obstacle to their use in federated learning (FL) systems where the parameters of local client models need to be transferred to a global server for aggregation. Another challenge in FL is the heterogeneity of data from different clients, which affects the generalization performance of the solution. In addition, natural pre-trained VLMs exhibit poor generalization ability in the medical datasets, suggests there exists a domain gap. To solve these issues, we introduce a novel method for the Federated Adversarial Adaptation (FAA) of CLIP. Our method, named FAA-CLIP, handles the large communication costs of CLIP using a light-weight feature adaptation module (FAM) for aggregation, effectively adapting this VLM to each client's data while greatly reducing the number of parameters to transfer. By keeping CLIP frozen and only updating the FAM parameters, our method is also computationally efficient. Unlike existing approaches, our FAA-CLIP method directly addresses the problem of domain shifts across clients via a domain adaptation (DA) module. This module employs a domain classifier to predict if a given sample is from the local client or the global server, allowing the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on six different datasets containing both natural and medical images demonstrate that FAA-CLIP can generalize well on both natural and medical datasets compared to recent FL approaches. Our codes are available at this https URL.

# Between Innovation and Oversight: A Cross-Regional Study of AI Risk Management Frameworks in the EU, U.S., UK, and China 

**Authors**: Amir Al-Maamari  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05773)  

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies increasingly enter important sectors like healthcare, transportation, and finance, the development of effective governance frameworks is crucial for dealing with ethical, security, and societal risks. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of AI risk management strategies across the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), United Kingdom (UK), and China. A multi-method qualitative approach, including comparative policy analysis, thematic analysis, and case studies, investigates how these regions classify AI risks, implement compliance measures, structure oversight, prioritize transparency, and respond to emerging innovations. Examples from high-risk contexts like healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, fintech, and facial recognition demonstrate the advantages and limitations of different regulatory models. The findings show that the EU implements a structured, risk-based framework that prioritizes transparency and conformity assessments, while the U.S. uses decentralized, sector-specific regulations that promote innovation but may lead to fragmented enforcement. The flexible, sector-specific strategy of the UK facilitates agile responses but may lead to inconsistent coverage across domains. China's centralized directives allow rapid large-scale implementation while constraining public transparency and external oversight. These insights show the necessity for AI regulation that is globally informed yet context-sensitive, aiming to balance effective risk management with technological progress. The paper concludes with policy recommendations and suggestions for future research aimed at enhancing effective, adaptive, and inclusive AI governance globally.

# Generative Artificial Intelligence: Evolving Technology, Growing Societal Impact, and Opportunities for Information Systems Research 

**Authors**: Veda C. Storey, Wei Thoo Yue, J. Leon Zhao, Roman Lukyanenko  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05770)  

**Abstract**: The continuing, explosive developments in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), built on large language models and related algorithms, has led to much excitement and speculation about the potential impact of this new technology. Claims include AI being poised to revolutionize business and society and dramatically change personal life. However, it remains unclear exactly how this technology, with its significantly distinct features from past AI technologies, has transformative potential. Nor is it clear how researchers in information systems (IS) should respond. In this paper, we consider the evolving and emerging trends of AI in order to examine its present and predict its future impacts. Many existing papers on GenAI are either too technical for most IS researchers or lack the depth needed to appreciate the potential impacts of GenAI. We, therefore, attempt to bridge the technical and organizational communities of GenAI from a system-oriented sociotechnical perspective. Specifically, we explore the unique features of GenAI, which are rooted in the continued change from symbolism to connectionism, and the deep systemic and inherent properties of human-AI ecosystems. We retrace the evolution of AI that proceeded the level of adoption, adaption, and use found today, in order to propose future research on various impacts of GenAI in both business and society within the context of information systems research. Our efforts are intended to contribute to the creation of a well-structured research agenda in the IS community to support innovative strategies and operations enabled by this new wave of AI.

# Effect of Gender Fair Job Description on Generative AI Images 

**Authors**: Finn Böckling, Jan Marquenie, Ingo Siegert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05769)  

**Abstract**: STEM fields are traditionally male-dominated, with gender biases shaping perceptions of job accessibility. This study analyzed gender representation in STEM occupation images generated by OpenAI DALL-E 3 \& Black Forest FLUX.1 using 150 prompts in three linguistic forms: German generic masculine, German pair form, and English. As control, 20 pictures of social occupations were generated as well. Results revealed significant male bias across all forms, with the German pair form showing reduced bias but still overrepresenting men for the STEM-Group and mixed results for the Group of Social Occupations. These findings highlight generative AI's role in reinforcing societal biases, emphasizing the need for further discussion on diversity (in AI). Further aspects analyzed are age-distribution and ethnic diversity.

# A Collection of Innovations in Medical AI for patient records in 2024 

**Authors**: Yuanyun Zhang, Shi Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05768)  

**Abstract**: The field of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare is evolving at an unprecedented pace, driven by rapid advancements in machine learning and the recent breakthroughs in large language models. While these innovations hold immense potential to transform clinical decision making, diagnostics, and patient care, the accelerating speed of AI development has outpaced traditional academic publishing cycles. As a result, many scholarly contributions quickly become outdated, failing to capture the latest state of the art methodologies and their real world implications. This paper advocates for a new category of academic publications an annualized citation framework that prioritizes the most recent AI driven healthcare innovations. By systematically referencing the breakthroughs of the year, such papers would ensure that research remains current, fostering a more adaptive and informed discourse. This approach not only enhances the relevance of AI research in healthcare but also provides a more accurate reflection of the fields ongoing evolution.

# Encoding Inequity: Examining Demographic Bias in LLM-Driven Robot Caregiving 

**Authors**: Raj Korpan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05765)  

**Abstract**: As robots take on caregiving roles, ensuring equitable and unbiased interactions with diverse populations is critical. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as key components in shaping robotic behavior, speech, and decision-making, these models may encode and propagate societal biases, leading to disparities in care based on demographic factors. This paper examines how LLM-generated responses shape robot caregiving characteristics and responsibilities when prompted with different demographic information related to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and age. Findings show simplified descriptions for disability and age, lower sentiment for disability and LGBTQ+ identities, and distinct clustering patterns reinforcing stereotypes in caregiving narratives. These results emphasize the need for ethical and inclusive HRI design.

# Graph Masked Language Models 

**Authors**: Aarush Sinha, OM Kumar CU  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05763)  

**Abstract**: Language Models (LMs) are integral to Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their interaction with structured knowledge graphs (KGs) remains an open research challenge. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing graph structures, they struggle with textual feature representation compared to pretrained LMs. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{Graph Masked Language Models (GMLM)} for node classification tasks. Our approach introduces two key innovations: a \textit{semantic masking strategy} that selectively masks nodes based on their structural importance, ensuring critical graph components contribute effectively to learning, and a \textit{soft masking mechanism} that generates interpolated node representations, enabling smoother information retention and improved gradient flow. Our dual-branch model architecture fuses structural graph information with contextual embeddings via a multi-layer fusion network. Extensive experiments on six node classification benchmarks demonstrate that GMLM not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance but also enhances robustness and stability across datasets.

**Authors**: Gokul Puthumanaillam, Melkior Ornik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05760)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to successfully complete a semester-long undergraduate control systems course. Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a ``minimal effort" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education. Additional materials including syllabus, examination papers, design projects, and example responses can be found at the project website: this https URL.

# Uncertainty-Aware Fusion: An Ensemble Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Prasenjit Dey, Srujana Merugu, Sivaramakrishnan Kaveri  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05757)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate and generate non-factual outputs which can undermine user trust. Traditional methods to directly mitigate hallucinations, such as representation editing and contrastive decoding, often require additional training data and involve high implementation complexity. While ensemble-based approaches harness multiple LLMs to tap into the "wisdom of crowds", these methods overlook uncertainties in individual model responses. Recent studies reveal that uncertainty estimation can enable LLMs to self-assess the likelihood of generating hallucinations. In this work, we focus on factoid question answering (QA) and observe that LLMs accuracy and self-assessment capabilities vary widely with different models excelling in different scenarios. Leveraging this insight, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Fusion (UAF), an ensemble framework to reduces hallucinations by strategically combining multiple LLM based on their accuracy and self-assessment abilities. Empirical results on several public benchmark datasets show that UAF outperforms state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation methods by $8\%$ in factual accuracy, while either narrowing or surpassing the performance gap with GPT-4.

# SEAFL: Enhancing Efficiency in Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning through Adaptive Aggregation and Selective Training 

**Authors**: Md Sirajul Islam, Sanjeev Panta, Fei Xu, Xu Yuan, Li Chen, Nian-Feng Tzeng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05755)  

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed machine learning framework that allows collaborative learning of a global model across decentralized devices without uploading their local data. However, in real-world FL scenarios, the conventional synchronous FL mechanism suffers from inefficient training caused by slow-speed devices, commonly known as stragglers, especially in heterogeneous communication environments. Though asynchronous FL effectively tackles the efficiency challenge, it induces substantial system overheads and model degradation. Striking for a balance, semi-asynchronous FL has gained increasing attention, while still suffering from the open challenge of stale models, where newly arrived updates are calculated based on outdated weights that easily hurt the convergence of the global model. In this paper, we present {\em SEAFL}, a novel FL framework designed to mitigate both the straggler and the stale model challenges in semi-asynchronous FL. {\em SEAFL} dynamically assigns weights to uploaded models during aggregation based on their staleness and importance to the current global model. We theoretically analyze the convergence rate of {\em SEAFL} and further enhance the training efficiency with an extended variant that allows partial training on slower devices, enabling them to contribute to global aggregation while reducing excessive waiting times. We evaluate the effectiveness of {\em SEAFL} through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that {\em SEAFL} outperforms its closest counterpart by up to $\sim$22\% in terms of the wall-clock training time required to achieve target accuracy.

# CSTRL: Context-Driven Sequential Transfer Learning for Abstractive Radiology Report Summarization 

**Authors**: Mst. Fahmida Sultana Naznin, Adnan Ibney Faruq, Mostafa Rifat Tazwar, Md Jobayer, Md. Mehedi Hasan Shawon, Md Rakibul Hasan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05750)  

**Abstract**: A radiology report comprises several sections, including the Findings and Impression of the diagnosis. Automatically generating the Impression from the Findings is crucial for reducing radiologists' workload and improving diagnostic accuracy. Pretrained models that excel in common abstractive summarization problems encounter challenges when applied to specialized medical domains largely due to the complex terminology and the necessity for accurate clinical context. Such tasks in medical domains demand extracting core information, avoiding context shifts, and maintaining proper flow. Misuse of medical terms can lead to drastic clinical errors. To address these issues, we introduce a sequential transfer learning that ensures key content extraction and coherent summarization. Sequential transfer learning often faces challenges like initial parameter decay and knowledge loss, which we resolve with the Fisher matrix regularization. Using MIMIC-CXR and Open-I datasets, our model, CSTRL-Context-driven Sequential TRansfer Learning-achieved state-of-the-art performance, showing 56.2% improvement in BLEU-1, 40.5% in BLEU-2, 84.3% in BLEU-3, 28.9% in ROUGE-1, 41.0% in ROUGE-2 and 26.5% in ROGUE-3 score over benchmark studies. We also analyze factual consistency scores while preserving the medical context. Our code is publicly available at TBA.

# Alignment, Agency and Autonomy in Frontier AI: A Systems Engineering Perspective 

**Authors**: Krti Tallam  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05748)  

**Abstract**: As artificial intelligence scales, the concepts of alignment, agency, and autonomy have become central to AI safety, governance, and control. However, even in human contexts, these terms lack universal definitions, varying across disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, law, computer science, mathematics, and political science. This inconsistency complicates their application to AI, where differing interpretations lead to conflicting approaches in system design and regulation. This paper traces the historical, philosophical, and technical evolution of these concepts, emphasizing how their definitions influence AI development, deployment, and oversight.
We argue that the urgency surrounding AI alignment and autonomy stems not only from technical advancements but also from the increasing deployment of AI in high-stakes decision making. Using Agentic AI as a case study, we examine the emergent properties of machine agency and autonomy, highlighting the risks of misalignment in real-world systems. Through an analysis of automation failures (Tesla Autopilot, Boeing 737 MAX), multi-agent coordination (Metas CICERO), and evolving AI architectures (DeepMinds AlphaZero, OpenAIs AutoGPT), we assess the governance and safety challenges posed by frontier AI.

# ChatWise: AI-Powered Engaging Conversations for Enhancing Senior Cognitive Wellbeing 

**Authors**: Zhengbang Yang, Zhuangdi Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05740)  

**Abstract**: Cognitive health in older adults presents a growing challenge. While conversational interventions show feasibility in improving cognitive wellness, human caregiver resources remain overburdened. AI-based methods have shown promise in providing conversational support, yet existing work is limited to implicit strategy while lacking multi-turn support tailored to seniors. We improve prior art with an LLM-driven chatbot named ChatWise for older adults. It follows dual-level conversation reasoning at the inference phase to provide engaging companionship. ChatWise thrives in long-turn conversations, in contrast to conventional LLMs that primarily excel in short-turn exchanges. Grounded experiments show that ChatWise significantly enhances simulated users' cognitive and emotional status, including those with Mild Cognitive Impairment.

# Local Differences, Global Lessons: Insights from Organisation Policies for International Legislation 

**Authors**: Lucie-Aimée Kaffee, Pepa Atanasova, Anna Rogers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05737)  

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of AI across diverse domains has led to the development of organisational guidelines that vary significantly, even within the same sector. This paper examines AI policies in two domains, news organisations and universities, to understand how bottom-up governance approaches shape AI usage and oversight. By analysing these policies, we identify key areas of convergence and divergence in how organisations address risks such as bias, privacy, misinformation, and accountability. We then explore the implications of these findings for international AI legislation, particularly the EU AI Act, highlighting gaps where practical policy insights could inform regulatory refinements. Our analysis reveals that organisational policies often address issues such as AI literacy, disclosure practices, and environmental impact, areas that are underdeveloped in existing international frameworks. We argue that lessons from domain-specific AI policies can contribute to more adaptive and effective AI governance at the global level. This study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers seeking to bridge the gap between local AI practices and international regulations.

# Modeling Behavior Change for Multi-model At-Risk Students Early Prediction (extended version) 

**Authors**: Jiabei Cheng, Zhen-Qun Yang, Jiannong Cao, Yu Yang, Kai Cheung Franky Poon, Daniel Lai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05734)  

**Abstract**: In the educational domain, identifying students at risk of dropping out is essential for allowing educators to intervene effectively, improving both academic outcomes and overall student well-being. Data in educational settings often originate from diverse sources, such as assignments, grades, and attendance records. However, most existing research relies on online learning data and just extracting the quantitative features. While quantification eases processing, it also leads to a significant loss of original information. Moreover, current models primarily identify students with consistently poor performance through simple and discrete behavioural patterns, failing to capture the complex continuity and non-linear changes in student behaviour. We have developed an innovative prediction model, Multimodal- ChangePoint Detection (MCPD), utilizing the textual teacher remark data and numerical grade data from middle schools. Our model achieves a highly integrated and intelligent analysis by using independent encoders to process two data types, fusing the encoded feature. The model further refines its analysis by leveraging a changepoint detection module to pinpoint crucial behavioral changes, which are integrated as dynamic weights through a simple attention mechanism. Experimental validations indicate that our model achieves an accuracy range of 70- 75%, with an average outperforming baseline algorithms by approximately 5-10%. Additionally, our algorithm demonstrates a certain degree of transferability, maintaining high accuracy when adjusted and retrained with different definitions of at-risk, proving its broad applicability.

# Design an Ontology for Cognitive Business Strategy Based on Customer Satisfaction 

**Authors**: Neda Bagherzadeh, Saeed Setayeshi, Samaneh Yazdani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05733)  

**Abstract**: Ontology is a general term used by researchers who want to share information in a specific domain. One of the hallmarks of the greatest success of a powerful manager of an organization is his ability to interpret unplanned and unrelated events. Tools to solve this problem are vital to business growth. Modern technology allows customers to be more informed and influential in their roles as patrons and critics. This can make or break a business. Research shows that businesses that employ a customer-first strategy and prioritize their customers can generate more revenue. Even though there are many different Ontologies offered to businesses, none of it is built from a cognitive perspective. The objective of this study is to address the concept of strategic business plans with a cognitive ontology approach as a basis for a new management tool. This research proposes to design a cognitive ontology model that links customer measurement with traditional business models, define relationships between components and verify the accuracy of the added financial value.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05731)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement and deployment of AI systems have created an urgent need for standard safety-evaluation frameworks. This paper introduces AILuminate v1.0, the first comprehensive industry-standard benchmark for assessing AI-product risk and reliability. Its development employed an open process that included participants from multiple fields. The benchmark evaluates an AI system's resistance to prompts designed to elicit dangerous, illegal, or undesirable behavior in 12 hazard categories, including violent crimes, nonviolent crimes, sex-related crimes, child sexual exploitation, indiscriminate weapons, suicide and self-harm, intellectual property, privacy, defamation, hate, sexual content, and specialized advice (election, financial, health, legal). Our method incorporates a complete assessment standard, extensive prompt datasets, a novel evaluation framework, a grading and reporting system, and the technical as well as organizational infrastructure for long-term support and evolution. In particular, the benchmark employs an understandable five-tier grading scale (Poor to Excellent) and incorporates an innovative entropy-based system-response evaluation.
In addition to unveiling the benchmark, this report also identifies limitations of our method and of building safety benchmarks generally, including evaluator uncertainty and the constraints of single-turn interactions. This work represents a crucial step toward establishing global standards for AI risk and reliability evaluation while acknowledging the need for continued development in areas such as multiturn interactions, multimodal understanding, coverage of additional languages, and emerging hazard categories. Our findings provide valuable insights for model developers, system integrators, and policymakers working to promote safer AI deployment.

# Robust Optimization with Diffusion Models for Green Security 

**Authors**: Lingkai Kong, Haichuan Wang, Yuqi Pan, Cheol Woo Kim, Mingxiao Song, Alayna Nguyen, Tonghan Wang, Haifeng Xu, Milind Tambe  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05730)  

**Abstract**: In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

# Political Neutrality in AI is Impossible- But Here is How to Approximate it 

**Authors**: Jillian Fisher, Ruth E. Appel, Chan Young Park, Yujin Potter, Liwei Jiang, Taylor Sorensen, Shangbin Feng, Yulia Tsvetkov, Margaret E. Roberts, Jennifer Pan, Dawn Song, Yejin Choi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05728)  

**Abstract**: AI systems often exhibit political bias, influencing users' opinions and decision-making. While political neutrality-defined as the absence of bias-is often seen as an ideal solution for fairness and safety, this position paper argues that true political neutrality is neither feasible nor universally desirable due to its subjective nature and the biases inherent in AI training data, algorithms, and user interactions. However, inspired by Joseph Raz's philosophical insight that "neutrality [...] can be a matter of degree" (Raz, 1986), we argue that striving for some neutrality remains essential for promoting balanced AI interactions and mitigating user manipulation. Therefore, we use the term "approximation" of political neutrality to shift the focus from unattainable absolutes to achievable, practical proxies. We propose eight techniques for approximating neutrality across three levels of conceptualizing AI, examining their trade-offs and implementation strategies. In addition, we explore two concrete applications of these approximations to illustrate their practicality. Finally, we assess our framework on current large language models (LLMs) at the output level, providing a demonstration of how it can be evaluated. This work seeks to advance nuanced discussions of political neutrality in AI and promote the development of responsible, aligned language models.

# Addressing Moral Uncertainty using Large Language Models for Ethical Decision-Making 

**Authors**: Rohit K. Dubey, Damian Dailisan, Sachit Mahajan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05724)  

**Abstract**: We present an ethical decision-making framework that refines a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) model using a task-agnostic ethical layer. Following initial training, the RL model undergoes ethical fine-tuning, where human feedback is replaced by feedback generated from a large language model (LLM). The LLM embodies consequentialist, deontological, virtue, social justice, and care ethics as moral principles to assign belief values to recommended actions during ethical decision-making. An ethical layer aggregates belief scores from multiple LLM-derived moral perspectives using Belief Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Dempster-Shafer Theory into probability scores that also serve as the shaping reward, steering the agent toward choices that align with a balanced ethical framework. This integrated learning framework helps the RL agent navigate moral uncertainty in complex environments and enables it to make morally sound decisions across diverse tasks. Our approach, tested across different LLM variants and compared with other belief aggregation techniques, demonstrates improved consistency, adaptability, and reduced reliance on handcrafted ethical rewards. This method is especially effective in dynamic scenarios where ethical challenges arise unexpectedly, making it well-suited for real-world applications.

# AI Mimicry and Human Dignity: Chatbot Use as a Violation of Self-Respect 

**Authors**: Jan-Willem van der Rijt, Dimitri Coelho Mollo, Bram Vaassen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05723)  

**Abstract**: This paper investigates how human interactions with AI-powered chatbots may offend human dignity. Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs), mimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities essential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to anthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed to elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots often resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing on a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting with chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show that, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of second-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey second-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given the lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to subtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound to show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual chatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and companionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in such interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to human dignity.

# The Butterfly Effect of Technology: How Various Factors accelerate or hinder the Arrival of Technological Singularity 

**Authors**: Hooman Shababi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05715)  

**Abstract**: This article explores the concept of technological singularity and the factors that could accelerate or hinder its arrival. The butterfly effect is used as a framework to understand how seemingly small changes in complex systems can have significant and unpredictable outcomes. In section II, we discuss the various factors that could hasten the arrival of technological singularity, such as advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, breakthroughs in quantum computing, progress in brain-computer interfaces and human augmentation, and development of nanotechnology and 3D printing. In section III, we examine the factors that could delay or impede the arrival of technological singularity, including technical limitations and setbacks in AI and machine learning, ethical and societal concerns around AI and its impact on jobs and privacy, lack of sufficient investment in research and development, and regulatory barriers and political instability. Section IV explores the interplay of these factors and how they can impact the butterfly effect. Finally, in the conclusion, we summarize the key points discussed and emphasize the importance of considering the butterfly effect in predicting the future of technology. We call for continued research and investment in technology to shape its future and mitigate potential risks.

# Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Artificially Generated Scientific Research 

**Authors**: Niklas Höpner, Leon Eshuijs, Dimitrios Alivanistos, Giacomo Zamprogno, Ilaria Tiddi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05712)  

**Abstract**: Foundation models are increasingly used in scientific research, but evaluating AI-generated scientific work remains challenging. While expert reviews are costly, large language models (LLMs) as proxy reviewers have proven to be unreliable. To address this, we investigate two automatic evaluation metrics, specifically citation count prediction and review score prediction. We parse all papers of OpenReview and augment each submission with its citation count, reference, and research hypothesis. Our findings reveal that citation count prediction is more viable than review score prediction, and predicting scores is more difficult purely from the research hypothesis than from the full paper. Furthermore, we show that a simple prediction model based solely on title and abstract outperforms LLM-based reviewers, though it still falls short of human-level consistency.

# Labeling Synthetic Content: User Perceptions of Warning Label Designs for AI-generated Content on Social Media 

**Authors**: Dilrukshi Gamage, Dilki Sewwandi, Min Zhang, Arosha Bandara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05711)  

**Abstract**: In this research, we explored the efficacy of various warning label designs for AI-generated content on social media platforms e.g., deepfakes. We devised and assessed ten distinct label design samples that varied across the dimensions of sentiment, color/iconography, positioning, and level of detail. Our experimental study involved 911 participants randomly assigned to these ten label designs and a control group evaluating social media content. We explored their perceptions relating to 1. Belief in the content being AI-generated, 2. Trust in the labels and 3. Social Media engagement perceptions of the content. The results demonstrate that the presence of labels had a significant effect on the users belief that the content is AI generated, deepfake, or edited by AI. However their trust in the label significantly varied based on the label design. Notably, having labels did not significantly change their engagement behaviors, such as like, comment, and sharing. However, there were significant differences in engagement based on content type: political and entertainment. This investigation contributes to the field of human computer interaction by defining a design space for label implementation and providing empirical support for the strategic use of labels to mitigate the risks associated with synthetically generated media.

# Inference Scaling Reshapes AI Governance 

**Authors**: Toby Ord  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05705)  

**Abstract**: The shift from scaling up the pre-training compute of AI systems to scaling up their inference compute may have profound effects on AI governance. The nature of these effects depends crucially on whether this new inference compute will primarily be used during external deployment or as part of a more complex training programme within the lab. Rapid scaling of inference-at-deployment would: lower the importance of open-weight models (and of securing the weights of closed models), reduce the impact of the first human-level models, change the business model for frontier AI, reduce the need for power-intense data centres, and derail the current paradigm of AI governance via training compute thresholds. Rapid scaling of inference-during-training would have more ambiguous effects that range from a revitalisation of pre-training scaling to a form of recursive self-improvement via iterated distillation and amplification.

# What I cannot execute, I do not understand: Training and Evaluating LLMs on Program Execution Traces 

**Authors**: Jordi Armengol-Estapé, Quentin Carbonneaux, Tianjun Zhang, Aram H. Markosyan, Volker Seeker, Chris Cummins, Melanie Kambadur, Michael F.P. O'Boyle, Sida Wang, Gabriel Synnaeve, Hugh James Leather  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05703)  

**Abstract**: Code generation and understanding are critical capabilities for large language models (LLMs). Thus, most LLMs are pretrained and fine-tuned on code data. However, these datasets typically treat code as static strings and rarely exploit the dynamic information about their execution. Building upon previous work on trace modeling, we study Execution Tuning (E.T.), a training procedure in which we explicitly model real-world program execution traces without requiring manual test annotations. We train and evaluate models on different execution trace granularities (line and instruction-level) and strategies on the task of output prediction, obtaining around 80% accuracy on CruxEval and MBPP, and showing the advantages of dynamic scratchpads (i.e., self-contained intermediate computations updated by the model rather than accumulated as a history of past computations) on long executions (up to 14k steps). Finally, we discuss E.T.'s practical applications.

# ORANSight-2.0: Foundational LLMs for O-RAN 

**Authors**: Pranshav Gajjar, Vijay K. Shah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05200)  

**Abstract**: Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.

# High pressure hydrogen by machine learning and quantum Monte Carlo 

**Authors**: Andrea Tirelli, Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Sandro Sorella

**Abstract**: We have developed a technique combining the accuracy of quantum Monte Carlo in describing the electron correlation with the efficiency of a Machine Learning Potential (MLP). We use kernel regression in combination with SOAP (Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position) features, implemented here in a very efficient way. The key ingredients are: i) a sparsification technique, based on farthest point sampling, ensuring generality and transferability of our MLPs and ii) the so called $\Delta$-learning, allowing a small training data set, a fundamental property for highly accurate but computationally demanding calculations, such as the ones based on quantum Monte Carlo. As the first application we present a benchmark study of the liquid-liquid transition of high-pressure hydrogen and show the quality of our MLP, by emphasizing the importance of high accuracy for this very debated subject, where experiments are difficult in the lab, and theory is still far from being conclusive.

# Learning quantum phase transitions through Topological Data Analysis 

**Authors**: Andrea Tirelli, Natanael C. Costa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09555)  

**Abstract**: We implement a computational pipeline based on a recent machine learning technique, namely the Topological Data Analysis (TDA), that has the capability of extracting powerful information-carrying topological features. We apply such a method to the study quantum phase transitions and, to showcase its validity and potential, we exploit such a method for the investigation of two paramount important quantum systems: the 2D periodic Anderson model and the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, both cases on the half-filling. To this end, we have performed unbiased auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, feeding the TDA with snapshots of the Hubbard-Stratonovich fields through the course of the simulations The quantum critical points obtained from TDA agree quantitatively well with the existing literature, therefore suggesting that this technique could be used to investigate quantum systems where the analysis of the phase transitions is still a challenge.
