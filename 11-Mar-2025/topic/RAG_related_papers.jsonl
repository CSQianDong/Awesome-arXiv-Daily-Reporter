Since effective moderation depends on understanding contextual cues, this imbalance increases the risk of improper moderation due to non-native moderators' limited cultural understanding. Through a user study, we identify that non-native moderators struggle with interpreting culturally-specific knowledge, sentiment, and internet culture in the hate speech moderation. To assist them, we present LLM-C3MOD, a human-LLM collaborative pipeline with three steps: (1) RAG-enhanced cultural context annotations; (2) initial LLM-based moderation; and (3) targeted human moderation for cases lacking LLM consensus. Evaluated on a Korean hate speech dataset with Indonesian and German participants, our system achieves 78% accuracy (surpassing GPT-4o's 71% baseline), while reducing human workload by 83.6%. Notably, human moderators excel at nuanced contents where LLMs struggle. Our findings suggest that non-native moderators, when properly supported by LLMs, can effectively contribute to cross-cultural hate speech moderation."}

However, this integration introduces a new security threat: adversaries can exploit the retrieval mechanism to inject malicious content into the knowledge base, thereby influencing the generated responses. Based on this attack vector, we propose CtrlRAG, a novel attack method designed for RAG system in the black-box setting, which aligns with real-world scenarios. Unlike existing attack methods, CtrlRAG introduces a perturbation mechanism using Masked Language Model (MLM) to dynamically optimize malicious content in response to changes in the retrieved context. Experimental results demonstrate that CtrlRAG outperforms three baseline methods in both Emotional Manipulation and Hallucination Amplification objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate three existing defense mechanisms, revealing their limited effectiveness against CtrlRAG and underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses.'}

However, they face challenges with knowledge sparsity, as users often provide brief, incomplete preference statements. While recent methods have integrated external knowledge sources to mitigate this, they still struggle with semantic understanding and complex preference reasoning. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, showing significant potential for CRSs. Nevertheless, due to the lack of domain knowledge, existing LLM-based CRSs either produce hallucinated recommendations or demand expensive domain-specific training, which largely limits their applicability. In this work, we present G-CRS (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model for Conversational Recommender Systems), a novel training-free framework that combines graph retrieval-augmented generation and in-context learning to enhance LLMs' recommendation capabilities. Specifically, G-CRS employs a two-stage retrieve-and-recommend architecture, where a GNN-based graph reasoner first identifies candidate items, followed by Personalized PageRank exploration to jointly discover potential items and similar user interactions. These retrieved contexts are then transformed into structured prompts for LLM reasoning, enabling contextually grounded recommendations without task-specific training. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that G-CRS achieves superior recommendation performance compared to existing methods without requiring task-specific training."}

Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. Evaluating retrieval effectiveness is also challenging due to dataset overlap with LLM pretraining data. In this work, we introduce HuixiangDou2, a robustly optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we leverage the effectiveness of dual-level retrieval and optimize its performance in a 32k context for maximum precision, and compare logic-based retrieval and dual-level retrieval to enhance overall functionality. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on a test set, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. With our approach, the score improved significantly from 60 to 74.5, as illustrated in the Figure. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic-form retrieval improves structured reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-stage verification mechanism to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. Empirical results show significant accuracy gains over baselines, highlighting the importance of adaptive retrieval. To support research and adoption, we release HuixiangDou2 as an open-source resource this https URL.'}

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology: decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.'}

Elbtity, Sumiya Syed, Sakila Alam, Kartik Pandit, Arnob Ghosh, Ramtin Zand, Shaahin Angizi', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05951', 'abstract': 'The increasing complexity and scale of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) necessitate specialized tensor accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to meet various computational and energy efficiency requirements. Nevertheless, designing optimal TPU remains challenging due to the high domain expertise level, considerable manual design time, and lack of high-quality, domain-specific datasets. This paper introduces TPU-Gen, the first Large Language Model (LLM) based framework designed to automate the exact and approximate TPU generation process, focusing on systolic array architectures. TPU-Gen is supported with a meticulously curated, comprehensive, and open-source dataset that covers a wide range of spatial array designs and approximate multiply-and-accumulate units, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization for different DNN workloads. The proposed framework leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as an effective solution for a data-scare hardware domain in building LLMs, addressing the most intriguing issue, hallucinations. TPU-Gen transforms high-level architectural specifications into optimized low-level implementations through an effective hardware generation pipeline. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate superior performance, power, and area efficiency, with an average reduction in area and power of 92\\% and 96\\% from the manual optimization reference values.

Shah', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05200', 'abstract': 'Despite the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across critical domains such as healthcare, customer service, and business marketing, their integration into Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) remains limited. This gap is primarily due to the absence of domain-specific foundational models, with existing solutions often relying on general-purpose LLMs that fail to address the unique challenges and technical intricacies of O-RAN. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORANSight-2.0 (O-RAN Insights), a pioneering initiative aimed at developing specialized foundational LLMs tailored for O-RAN. Built on 18 LLMs spanning five open-source LLM frameworks, ORANSight-2.0 fine-tunes models ranging from 1 to 70B parameters, significantly reducing reliance on proprietary, closed-source models while enhancing performance for O-RAN. At the core of ORANSight-2.0 is RANSTRUCT, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based instruction-tuning framework that employs two LLM agents to create high-quality instruction-tuning datasets. The generated dataset is then used to fine-tune the 18 pre-trained open-source LLMs via QLoRA. To evaluate ORANSight-2.0, we introduce srsRANBench, a novel benchmark designed for code generation and codebase understanding in the context of srsRAN, a widely used 5G O-RAN stack. We also leverage ORANBench13K, an existing benchmark for assessing O-RAN-specific knowledge. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that ORANSight-2.0 models outperform general-purpose and closed-source models, such as ChatGPT-4o and Gemini, by 5.421% on ORANBench and 18.465% on srsRANBench, achieving superior performance while maintaining lower computational and energy costs. We also experiment with RAG-augmented variants of ORANSight-2.0 LLMs and thoroughly evaluate their energy characteristics, demonstrating costs for training, standard inference, and RAG-augmented inference.'}
