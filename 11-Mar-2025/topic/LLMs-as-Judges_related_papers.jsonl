{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2503.07144', 'title': 'MRCEval: A Comprehensive, Challenging and Accessible Machine Reading Comprehension Benchmark', 'authors': 'Shengkun Ma, Hao Peng, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07144', 'abstract': 'Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an essential task in evaluating natural language understanding. Existing MRC datasets primarily assess specific aspects of reading comprehension (RC), lacking a comprehensive MRC benchmark. To fill this gap, we first introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes the key capabilities required for RC. Based on this taxonomy, we construct MRCEval, an MRC benchmark that leverages advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) as both sample generators and selection judges. MRCEval is a comprehensive, challenging and accessible benchmark designed to assess the RC capabilities of LLMs thoroughly, covering 13 distinct RC skills with a total of 2.1K high-quality multi-choice questions. We perform an extensive evaluation of 28 widely used open-source and proprietary models, highlighting that MRC continues to present significant challenges even in the era of LLMs.'}

However, humans often approach problem-solving from a reverse perspective, for instance, by choosing the worse option instead of the better one in a pairwise comparison. Generally, this kind of reverse thinking plays a crucial role in human reasoning and decision-making and can further test the difference between original and reverse thought processes simultaneously. To address the above issue, in this paper, we propose a Goal-Reversed Prompting (GRP) approach for pairwise evaluation that shifts the original task from selecting the better answer to choosing the worse one. We encourage LLMs to think in reverse by prompting LLMs to identify the worse response. Experiments on closed-source models demonstrate that GRP significantly enhances evaluation capabilities, outperforming the prompt template with the original goal.'}

Since human evaluation is laborious and costly, prompting MLLMs as automated process judges has become a common practice. However, the reliability of these model-based judges remains uncertain. To address this, we introduce ProJudgeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of MLLM-based process judges. ProJudgeBench comprises 2,400 test cases and 50,118 step-level labels, spanning four scientific disciplines with diverse difficulty levels and multi-modal content. In ProJudgeBench, each step is meticulously annotated by human experts for correctness, error type, and explanation, enabling a systematic evaluation of judges' capabilities to detect, classify and diagnose errors. Evaluation on ProJudgeBench reveals a significant performance gap between open-source and proprietary models. To bridge this gap, we further propose ProJudge-173k, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset, and a Dynamic Dual-Phase fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to explicitly reason through problem-solving before assessing solutions. Both contributions significantly enhance the process evaluation capabilities of open-source models. All the resources will be released to foster future research of reliable multi-modal process evaluation."}
