**Abstract**: With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), query generation techniques that expand documents and queries with related terms are becoming increasingly popular in the information retrieval field. Such techniques have been shown to improve the effectiveness of traditional lexical retrieval methods by dealing with the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent work has found that generating queries with a greedy decoding strategy can produce sub-optimal queries, including hallucinations, and proposed to filter out queries before expansion. This `generate-then-filter' approach is costly, as it requires generating multiple queries and applying a relevance model to all of them and does not teach the LLM which of the generated queries is more effective for expansion. To overcome such limitations, we propose Aligned Query Expansion (AQE), a novel approach to enhance query expansion for passage retrieval in open-domain question answering. AQE leverages recent techniques in LLM alignment to fine-tune models for generating query expansions that directly optimize the effectiveness of the retrieval task, eliminating the need for additional filtering steps. This alignment ensures that queries are more relevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness. Empirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query expansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.

# AirLLM: Diffusion Policy-based Adaptive LoRA for Remote Fine-Tuning of LLM over the Air

**Abstract**: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.

**Authors**: Jayant Havare, Saurav Chaudhary, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Kaushik Maharajan, Srikanth Tamilselvam

**Abstract**: Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.

# GHPO: Adaptive Guidance for Stable and Efficient LLM Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Ziru Liu, Cheng Gong, Xinyu Fu, Yaofang Liu, Ran Chen, Shoubo Hu, Suiyun Zhang, Rui Liu, Qingfu Zhang, Dandan Tu

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

# Fine-tuning Large Language Model for Automated Algorithm Design 

**Authors**: Fei Liu, Rui Zhang, Xi Lin, Zhichao Lu, Qingfu Zhang

**Abstract**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms. However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality, then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover, we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings. These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

# Orchestrator-Agent Trust: A Modular Agentic AI Visual Classification System with Trust-Aware Orchestration and RAG-Based Reasoning 

**Authors**: Konstantinos I. Roumeliotis, Ranjan Sapkota, Manoj Karkee, Nikolaos D. Tselikas

**Abstract**: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: this https URL
