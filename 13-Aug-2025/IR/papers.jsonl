{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2508.09090', 'title': 'SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system', 'authors': 'Jialiang Shi, Yaguang Dou, Tian Qi', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09090', 'abstract': 'Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS. Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1) Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users\' real-time consumption preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy, mainly matching users\' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space. This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference, revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and practical value of the proposed method.'}

However, existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that might misalign with the user\'s actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that are more closely aligned with each user\'s popularity preferences than ACCENT alone.'}

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact, interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient, profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in recommender systems."}

Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies. To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block (CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for route recommendations.'}

IndeGx is a framework leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge graph endpoints.'}

However, not all search queries require personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets. The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by outperforming state-of-the-art methods."}

Traditional user profiling often fails to capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences. This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive, context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset characteristics for practical applicability."}

Existing approaches often rely on simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling (LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating natural language representations of user histories using a large language model (LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based recommendation.'}

However, this approach can result in suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise, query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.'}

A key challenge in this domain is the fragmented nature of event logs in shift books, where related records, e.g., entries documenting issues related to equipment or processes and the corresponding solutions, may remain disconnected. This fragmentation hinders the recommendation of previous solutions to the users. To address this problem, we investigate record linking (RL) as link prediction, commonly studied in graph-based machine learning, by framing it as a cross-document coreference resolution (CDCR) task enhanced with natural language inference (NLI) and semantic text similarity (STS) by shifting it into the causal inference (CI). We adapt CDCR, traditionally applied in the news domain, into an RL model to operate at the passage level, similar to NLI and STS, while accommodating the process industry's specific text formats, which contain unstructured text and structured record attributes. Our RL model outperformed the best versions of NLI- and STS-driven baselines by 28% (11.43 points) and 27% (11.21 points), respectively. Our work demonstrates how domain adaptation of the state-of-the-art CDCR models, enhanced with reasoning capabilities, can be effectively tailored to the process industry, improving data quality and connectivity in shift logs."}

While most of the previous work focused on tackling answer and attribution correctness, a recent line of work investigated faithfulness, with a focus on leveraging internal model signals to reflect a model's actual decision-making process while generating the answer. Nevertheless, these methods induce additional latency and have shown limitations in directly aligning token generation with attribution generation. In this paper, we introduce LoDIT, a method that jointly generates and faithfully attributes answers in RAG by leveraging specific token logits during generation. It consists of two steps: (1) marking the documents with specific token identifiers and then leveraging the logits of these tokens to estimate the contribution of each document to the answer during generation, and (2) aggregating these contributions into document attributions. Experiments on a trustworthiness-focused attributed text-generation benchmark, Trust-Align, show that LoDIT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on several metrics. Finally, an in-depth analysis of LoDIT shows both its efficiency in terms of latency and its robustness in different settings."}

Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences, lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline."}

This study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs) in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43 rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class, and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3, and a county-centroid heuristic.\nThe top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km (median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70% (Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12 km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit in this evaluation.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and cost-effective historical georeferencing."}
