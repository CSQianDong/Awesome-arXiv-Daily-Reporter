Two of the most fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem, administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical challenges."}

This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration. We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat, goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge for operational success."}

Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies.

In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy."}

This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction. Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and constructing a rigorous proof.

Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably, Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance. Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured reasoning and consistent accuracy.

This concern extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA, captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima) falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model\'s cross-task "ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data (extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but harms overall generalization.

SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.'}

But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications, and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction tasks.'}

This limitation primarily stems from two factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and (2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically, we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better understand vulnerability patterns.

We first reveal that behavioral hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint embedding space.

Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.'}

WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions.

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns, and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches, SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples.

This paper comprehensively reviews the application and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation\'s unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,).

However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces.

This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think.

We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales.

We find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstraL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks.'}

Evaluations of multiple state-of-the-art LLMs on GaRAGe show that the models tend to over-summarise rather than (a) ground their answers strictly on the annotated relevant passages (reaching at most a Relevance-Aware Factuality Score of 60%), or (b) deflect when no relevant grounding is available (reaching at most 31% true positive rate in deflections). The F1 in attribution to relevant sources is at most 58.9%, and we show that performance is particularly reduced when answering time-sensitive questions and when having to draw knowledge from sparser private grounding sources."}

To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, an LM-based framework consisting of LeLM and a music codec. LeLM is capable of parallelly modeling two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types.

This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and DPO post-training.

Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories.

For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements.

We evaluate 32 LLMs across seven jailbreak benchmarks, and find that malicious queries with style patterns inflate the attack success rate (ASR) for nearly all models. Notably, ASR inflation correlates with both the length of style patterns and the relative attention an LLM exhibits on them. We then investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles. Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs and five fine-tuning style settings, SafeStyle consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.'}

One especially promising use case is the automatic creation of fundamental analysis reports, which are essential for making informed investment decisions, evaluating credit risks, guiding corporate mergers, etc. While LLMs attempt to generate these reports from a single prompt, the risks of inaccuracy are significant. Poor analysis can lead to misguided investments, regulatory issues, and loss of trust. Existing financial benchmarks mainly evaluate how well LLMs answer financial questions but do not reflect performance in real-world tasks like generating financial analysis reports. In this paper, we propose FinAR-Bench, a solid benchmark dataset focusing on financial statement analysis, a core competence of fundamental analysis. To make the evaluation more precise and reliable, we break this task into three measurable steps: extracting key information, calculating financial indicators, and applying logical reasoning. This structured approach allows us to objectively assess how well LLMs perform each step of the process. Our findings offer a clear understanding of LLMs current strengths and limitations in fundamental analysis and provide a more practical way to benchmark their performance in real-world financial settings.'}

Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to unnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and exploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the length of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show that LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an interactive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights on the model\'s planning dynamics.

To address this limitation, we propose SDE-SQL, a framework that enables large language models to perform self-driven exploration of databases during inference. This is accomplished by generating and executing SQL probes, which allow the model to actively retrieve information from the database and iteratively update its understanding of the data. Unlike prior methods, SDE-SQL operates in a zero-shot setting, without relying on any question-SQL pairs as in-context demonstrations. When evaluated on the BIRD benchmark with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, SDE-SQL achieves an 8.02% relative improvement in execution accuracy over the vanilla Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct baseline, establishing a new state-of-the-art among methods based on open-source models without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or model ensembling.

However, CoT can introduce more variability in answers, sometimes triggering occasional errors in questions the model would otherwise get right. We also found that many recent models perform some form of CoT reasoning even if not asked; for these models, a request to perform CoT had little impact.

Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), which have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide task planning in G-TAMP problems.

Although existing approaches often attain high accuracy, they typically operate as black boxes without providing human-understandable justifications. Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), while not originally intended for forgery detection, exhibit strong analytical and reasoning capabilities. When properly fine-tuned, they can effectively identify AI-generated images and offer meaningful explanations. However, existing MLLMs still struggle with hallucination and often fail to align their visual interpretations with actual image content and human reasoning. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset of AI-generated images annotated with bounding boxes and descriptive captions that highlight synthesis artifacts, establishing a foundation for human-aligned visual-textual grounded reasoning. We then finetune MLLMs through a multi-stage optimization strategy that progressively balances the objectives of accurate detection, visual localization, and coherent textual explanation. The resulting model achieves superior performance in both detecting AI-generated images and localizing visual flaws, significantly outperforming baseline methods.'}

Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment.

A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text.

Yet, these verbose traces slow down inference and often drift into unnecessary detail, known as the overthinking phenomenon. To better understand LRMs\' behavior, we systematically analyze the token-level misalignment between reasoning and non-reasoning models. While it is expected that their primary difference lies in the stylistic "thinking cues", LRMs uniquely exhibit two pivotal, previously under-explored phenomena: a Global Misalignment Rebound, where their divergence from non-reasoning models persists or even grows as response length increases, and more critically, a Local Misalignment Diminish, where the misalignment concentrates at the "thinking cues" each sentence starts with but rapidly declines in the remaining of the sentence. Motivated by the Local Misalignment Diminish, we propose FoReaL-Decoding, a collaborative fast-slow thinking decoding method for cost-quality trade-off. In FoReaL-Decoding, a Leading model leads the first few tokens for each sentence, and then a weaker draft model completes the following tokens to the end of each sentence. FoReaL-Decoding adopts a stochastic gate to smoothly interpolate between the small and the large model. On four popular math-reasoning benchmarks (AIME24, GPQA-Diamond, MATH500, AMC23), FoReaL-Decoding reduces theoretical FLOPs by 30 to 50% and trims CoT length by up to 40%, while preserving 86 to 100% of model performance.

This LLM-based framework leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates compared to baseline approaches.'}

Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety.

Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks - such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in this https URL'}

As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing. Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple "Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.'}

To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics. Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4% increase in accuracy.

This paper introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1) extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text), and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Its design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process. With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves 80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.'}

This can make it difficult or impossible to reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs), trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.'}

The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state. The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts.

At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24, creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion.

Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency. Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1 x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality.

However, their ability to attend to truly critical information during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the pace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting patterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing these patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation quality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training data, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal instruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant reasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead and, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus (LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding factors. In the first stage, LeaF employs gradient-based comparisons with an advanced teacher to automatically identify confounding tokens based on causal relationships in the training corpus. Then, in the second stage, it prunes these tokens during distillation to enact intervention, aligning the student's attention with the teacher's focus distribution on truly critical context tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that LeaF not only achieves an absolute improvement in various mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks but also effectively suppresses attention to confounding tokens during inference, yielding a more interpretable and reliable reasoning model."}

However, editing such models efficiently and reliably - without retraining or forgetting previous information - remains a major challenge.

We propose MEMOIR, a novel scalable framework that injects knowledge through a residual memory, i.e., a dedicated parameter module, while preserving the core capabilities of the pre-trained model. By sparsifying input activations through sample-dependent masks, MEMOIR confines each edit to a distinct subset of the memory parameters, minimizing interference among edits. At inference, it identifies relevant edits by comparing the sparse activation patterns of new queries to those stored during editing. This enables generalization to rephrased queries by activating only the relevant knowledge while suppressing unnecessary memory activation for unrelated prompts.

Through extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning. Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled supervised fine-tuning (SFT).

Our approach generates domain-specific keywords and related word lists using TF and Term TF-IDF methods and constructs prompt-target pairs. We evaluate models by measuring their ability to complete these prompts with the correct domain-specific targets, providing a direct assessment of domain knowledge with low computational cost. Through comprehensive experiments across multiple models (GPT-2 medium/XL, Llama-2/3.1, OLMo-2, Qwen-2, Mistral) and domains, we demonstrate that our benchmark strongly correlates with expert-generated benchmarks while providing a more accurate measure of domain knowledge than traditional perplexity metrics. We reveal that domain adaptation happens rapidly in smaller models (within 500 steps) and illustrate a new approach to domain knowledge evaluation in base models during training for early stopping. By extending mechanistic analysis to domain adaptation, we discover that initial-to-mid layers are primarily responsible for attribute extraction, while later layers focus on next token prediction. Furthermore, we show that during adaptation, forgetting begins in the middle layers, where attribute extraction happens and is amplified in later layers. Our work provides both a practical evaluation methodology for domain-specific LMs and novel insights into knowledge representation during adaptation, with implications for more efficient fine-tuning strategies and targeted approaches to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.'}

However, their susceptibility to jailbreaks and perturbations necessitates additional evaluations. Many LLMs are multilingual, but safety-related training data contains mainly high-resource languages like English. This can leave them vulnerable to perturbations in low-resource languages such as Polish. We show how surprisingly strong attacks can be cheaply created by altering just a few characters and using a small proxy model for word importance calculation. We find that these character and word-level attacks drastically alter the predictions of different LLMs, suggesting a potential vulnerability that can be used to circumvent their internal safety mechanisms. We validate our attack construction methodology on Polish, a low-resource language, and find potential vulnerabilities of LLMs in this language. Additionally, we show how it can be extended to other languages. We release the created datasets and code for further research.'}

Yet, studies show that these post-hoc explanations often misrepresent the true decision process, as revealed by mismatches in feature importance. Despite growing evidence of this inconsistency, no systematic solutions have emerged, partly due to the high cost of estimating feature importance, which limits evaluations to small datasets. To address this, we introduce the Post-hoc Self-Consistency Bank (PSCB) - a large-scale benchmark of decisions spanning diverse tasks and models, each paired with LLM-generated explanations and corresponding feature importance scores. Analysis of PSCB reveals that self-consistency scores barely differ between correct and incorrect predictions. We also show that the standard metric fails to meaningfully distinguish between explanations. To overcome this limitation, we propose an alternative metric that more effectively captures variation in explanation quality. We use it to fine-tune LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leading to significantly better alignment between explanations and decision-relevant features, even under domain shift. Our findings point to a scalable path toward more trustworthy, self-consistent LLMs.'}

While existing methods for analyzing text-based outputs exist, they focus on fundamentally different problems, such as measuring bias or fairness. To this end, we introduce distribution-based perturbation analysis, a framework that reformulates LLM perturbation analysis as a frequentist hypothesis testing problem. We construct empirical null and alternative output distributions within a low-dimensional semantic similarity space via Monte Carlo sampling, enabling tractable inference without restrictive distributional assumptions. The framework is (i) model-agnostic, (ii) supports the evaluation of arbitrary input perturbations on any black-box LLM, (iii) yields interpretable p-values; (iv) supports multiple perturbations via controlled error rates; and (v) provides scalar effect sizes. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework across multiple case studies, showing how we can quantify response changes, measure true/false positive rates, and evaluate alignment with reference models.

While some prior works address this issue, fundamentally filtering harmful data from user data remains unexplored. Motivated by our observation that a directional representation reflecting refusal behavior (called the refusal feature) obtained from safety-aligned LLMs can inherently distinguish between harmful and harmless prompts, we propose the Refusal-Feature-guided Teacher (ReFT). Our ReFT model is trained to identify harmful prompts based on the similarity between input prompt features and its refusal feature. During finetuning, the ReFT model serves as a teacher that filters harmful prompts from user data and distills alignment knowledge into the base model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReFT-based finetuning strategy effectively minimizes harmful outputs and enhances finetuning accuracy for user-specific tasks, offering a practical solution for secure and reliable deployment of LLMs in Finetuning-as-a-Service.'}

In this paper we present a fine-tuning strategy that we call ConfQA, which can reduce hallucination rate from 20-40% to under 5% across multiple factuality benchmarks. The core idea is simple: when the LLM answers a question correctly, it is trained to continue with the answer; otherwise, it is trained to admit "I am unsure". But there are two key factors that make the training highly effective. First, we introduce a dampening prompt "answer only if you are confident" to explicitly guide the behavior, without which hallucination remains high as 15%-25%. Second, we leverage simple factual statements, specifically attribute values from knowledge graphs, to help LLMs calibrate the confidence, resulting in robust generalization across domains and question types. Building on this insight, we propose the Dual Neural Knowledge framework, which seamlessly select between internally parameterized neural knowledge and externally recorded symbolic knowledge based on ConfQA\'s confidence. The framework enables potential accuracy gains to beyond 95%, while reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.'}

Recent studies have challenged the Stochastic Parrots analogy by demonstrating that LLMs are capable of understanding semantics rather than merely memorizing data and that randomness, modulated by sampling temperature, plays a crucial role in model inference. In this study, we systematically evaluated the impact of temperature in the range of 0 to 2 on data sets designed to assess six different capabilities, conducting statistical analyses on open source models of three different sizes: small (1B--4B), medium (6B--13B), and large (40B--80B). Our findings reveal distinct skill-specific effects of temperature on model performance, highlighting the complexity of optimal temperature selection in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose a BERT-based temperature selector that takes advantage of these observed effects to identify the optimal temperature for a given prompt. We demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve the performance of small and medium models in the SuperGLUE datasets. Furthermore, our study extends to FP16 precision inference, revealing that temperature effects are consistent with those observed in 4-bit quantized models. By evaluating temperature effects up to 4.0 in three quantized models, we find that the Mutation Temperature -- the point at which significant performance changes occur -- increases with model size.'}

However, their knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data, while real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge typically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning (ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of modern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs perform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect evolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a player\'s "current team" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new benchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical Wikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news articles to simulate real-world information accumulation. Our analysis reveals that LLMs often struggle to reconcile conflicting or outdated facts and can be misled when multiple versions of a fact appear in context. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight, agentic framework that incrementally builds a structured, external memory from source documents without requiring re-training. This knowledge organization strategy enables models to retrieve and reason over temporally filtered, relevant information at inference time. Empirically, our method outperforms ICL and RAG baselines across both benchmarks, especially on questions requiring more complex reasoning or integration of conflicting facts.'}

We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.'}

In this work, we introduce Adversarial Paraphrasing, a training-free attack framework that universally humanizes any AI-generated text to evade detection more effectively. Our approach leverages an off-the-shelf instruction-following LLM to paraphrase AI-generated content under the guidance of an AI text detector, producing adversarial examples that are specifically optimized to bypass detection. Extensive experiments show that our attack is both broadly effective and highly transferable across several detection systems. For instance, compared to simple paraphrasing attack--which, ironically, increases the true positive at 1% false positive (T@1%F) by 8.57% on RADAR and 15.03% on Fast-DetectGPT--adversarial paraphrasing, guided by OpenAI-RoBERTa-Large, reduces T@1%F by 64.49% on RADAR and a striking 98.96% on Fast-DetectGPT.

We conducted comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4 extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2 shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification, temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical causation.

In this work, we explore emotion reasoning, a strategy that leverages the generative capabilities of AudioLLMs to enhance emotion recognition by producing semantically aligned, evidence-grounded explanations. To support this in multitask AudioLLMs, we introduce a unified framework combining reasoning-augmented data supervision, dual-encoder architecture, and task-alternating training. This approach enables AudioLLMs to effectively learn different tasks while incorporating emotional reasoning. Experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD show that our approach not only improves emotion prediction accuracy but also enhances the coherence and evidential grounding of the generated responses.'}

Leveraging, for the first time, the large IMPAQTS corpus, which comprises Italian political speeches with the annotation of manipulative implicit content, we propose methods to test the effectiveness of LLMs in this challenging problem. Through a multiple-choice task and an open-ended generation task, we demonstrate that all tested models struggle to interpret presuppositions and implicatures.

However, systematic exploration of their dual capabilities to autonomously persuade and resist persuasion, particularly in contexts involving psychological rhetoric, remains unexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs by tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial dialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ repetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven comprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly instructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and Repetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates. However, no ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy proves universally effective, with performance heavily dependent on contextual counterfactuals. Motivated by these observations, we propose an adaptive framework based on direct preference optimization that trains LLMs to autonomously select optimal strategies by leveraging persuasion results from strategy-specific responses as preference pairs. Experiments on three open-source LLMs confirm that the proposed adaptive psychological persuasion method effectively enables persuader LLMs to select optimal strategies, significantly enhancing their success rates while maintaining general capabilities.

Motivated by these limitations, the research community has moved beyond static retrieval and in-context knowledge injection. Among the emerging directions, this tutorial delves into two rapidly growing and complementary research areas on RAG: Dynamic RAG and Parametric RAG. Dynamic RAG adaptively determines when and what to retrieve during the LLM's generation process, enabling real-time adaptation to the LLM's evolving information needs. Parametric RAG rethinks how retrieved knowledge should be injected into LLMs, transitioning from input-level to parameter-level knowledge injection for enhanced efficiency and effectiveness.

To capture and evaluate these legal skills in language models, we introduce BRIEFME, a new dataset focused on legal briefs. It contains three tasks for language models to assist legal professionals in writing briefs: argument summarization, argument completion, and case retrieval. In this work, we describe the creation of these tasks, analyze them, and show how current models perform. We see that today's large language models (LLMs) are already quite good at the summarization and guided completion tasks, even beating human-generated headings.

Our study compares zero-shot LLMs with supervised classifiers trained on both conventional text embeddings and LLM-generated summary embeddings. Our experiments reveal that while zero-shot LLMs demonstrate strong generalization capabilities in binary classification, they struggle with fine-grained ordinal classifications.

Existing defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel, we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score.

A key challenge is the long-tail problem, where extreme data sparsity and cold-start issues limit the performance of traditional recommendation methods. To address this, we propose a novel long-tail product recommendation mechanism that integrates product text descriptions and user behavior sequences using a large-scale language model (LLM). First, we introduce a semantic visor, which leverages a pre-trained LLM to convert multimodal textual content such as product titles, descriptions, and user reviews into meaningful embeddings. These embeddings help represent item-level semantics effectively. We then employ an attention-based user intent encoder that captures users' latent interests, especially toward long-tail items, by modeling collaborative behavior patterns. These components feed into a hybrid ranking model that fuses semantic similarity scores, collaborative filtering outputs, and LLM-generated recommendation candidates. Extensive experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset show that our method outperforms baseline models in recall (+12%), hit rate (+9%), and user coverage (+15%).
