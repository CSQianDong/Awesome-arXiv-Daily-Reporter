**Abstract**: Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable reasoning.

# Adversarial Attacks on LLM-as-a-Judge Systems: Insights from Prompt Injections

**Abstract**: LLM as judge systems used to assess text quality code correctness and argument strength are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. We introduce a framework that separates content author attacks from system prompt attacks and evaluate five models Gemma 3.27B Gemma 3.4B Llama 3.2 3B GPT 4 and Claude 3 Opus on four tasks with various defenses using fifty prompts per condition. Attacks achieved up to seventy three point eight percent success smaller models proved more vulnerable and transferability ranged from fifty point five to sixty two point six percent. Our results contrast with Universal Prompt Injection and AdvPrompter We recommend multi model committees and comparative scoring and release all code and datasets
