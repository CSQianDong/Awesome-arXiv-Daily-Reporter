To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month."}

It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants."}

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications."}

Recent work uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate preference labeling, but a single final-state image generally fails to capture the agent's full motion. In this paper, we present a two-part solution that both improves feedback accuracy and better aligns reward learning with the agent's policy. First, we overlay trajectory sketches on final observations to reveal the path taken, allowing VLMs to provide more reliable preferences-improving preference accuracy by approximately 15-20% in metaworld tasks. Second, we regularize reward learning by incorporating the agent's performance, ensuring that the reward model is optimized based on data generated by the current policy; this addition boosts episode returns by 20-30% in locomotion tasks.

The inter-state attention mechanism models the relationships between state points, while the gated feed-forward network enhances inter-channel correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to model queries as system states and scene points as system inputs, which can simultaneously update scene point features and query features with linear complexity. Extensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our DEST-based method. Our method improves the GroupFree baseline in terms of AP50 on ScanNet V2 (+5.3) and SUN RGB-D (+3.2) datasets. Based on the VDETR baseline, Our method sets a new SOTA on the ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D datasets.'}

Gricean conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation, and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.

Although their linear compute scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels. Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear Attention (FLA) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention, by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this work, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes by introducing an additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk.

This dataset is further augmented by two external legal corpora that provide additional legal knowledge for the task: one comprising statutes and regulations, and the other consisting of a large collection of past judgment documents. In collaboration with legal professionals, we establish a comprehensive automated evaluation framework to assess the quality of generated judgment documents across various dimensions. We evaluate various baseline approaches, including few-shot in-context learning, fine-tuning, and a multi-source retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach, using both general and legal-domain LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that, while RAG approaches can effectively improve performance in this task, there is still substantial room for further improvement.

However, current RL-based exploration algorithms often face limited environmental reasoning capabilities, slow convergence rates, and substantial challenges in Sim-To-Real (S2R) transfer. To address these issues, we propose a Curriculum Learning-based Transformer Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (CTSAC) aimed at improving both exploration efficiency and transfer performance. To enhance the robot's reasoning ability, a Transformer is integrated into the perception network of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework, leveraging historical information to improve the farsightedness of the strategy. A periodic review-based curriculum learning is proposed, which enhances training efficiency while mitigating catastrophic forgetting during curriculum transitions. Training is conducted on the ROS-Gazebo continuous robotic simulation platform, with LiDAR clustering optimization to further reduce the S2R gap. Experimental results demonstrate the CTSAC algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art non-learning and learning-based algorithms in terms of success rate and success rate-weighted exploration time. Moreover, real-world experiments validate the strong S2R transfer capabilities of CTSAC."}

However, accurate detection of persons from overhead fisheye images remains an open challenge because of factors including person rotation and small-sized persons. To address the person rotation problem, we convert the fisheye images into panoramic images. For smaller people, we focused on the geometry of the panoramas. Conventional detection methods tend to focus on larger people because these larger people yield large significant areas for feature maps. In equirectangular panoramic images, we find that a person's height decreases linearly near the top of the images. Using this finding, we leverage the significance values and aggregate tokens that are sorted based on these values to balance the significant areas. In this leveraging process, we introduce panoramic distortion-aware tokenization. This tokenization procedure divides a panoramic image using self-similarity figures that enable determination of optimal divisions without gaps, and we leverage the maximum significant values in each tile of token groups to preserve the significant areas of smaller people. To achieve higher detection accuracy, we propose a person detection and localization method that combines panoramic-image remapping and the tokenization procedure.

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.'}

That reduces the prediction horizon length, leading to a decrease in solution quality. Besides, the fixed time-step length limits the utilization of the available UAV dynamics in the target neighborhood.

The performance of these models is determined by a complex interdependence among the model architecture, optimization/loss function and datasets. Although FRSs have surpassed human-level accuracy, they continue to be disparate against certain demographics. Due to the ubiquity of applications, it is extremely important to understand the impact of the three components -- model architecture, loss function and face image dataset on the accuracy-disparity trade-off to design better, unbiased platforms. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of three FRSs for the task of gender prediction, with various architectural modifications resulting in ten deep-learning models coupled with four loss functions and benchmark them on seven face datasets across 266 evaluation configurations. Our results show that all three components have an individual as well as a combined impact on both accuracy and disparity. We identify that datasets have an inherent property that causes them to perform similarly across models, independent of the choice of loss functions. Moreover, the choice of dataset determines the model's perceived bias -- the same model reports bias in opposite directions for three gender-balanced datasets of ``in-the-wild'' face images of popular individuals. Studying the facial embeddings shows that the models are unable to generalize a uniform definition of what constitutes a ``female face'' as opposed to a ``male face'', due to dataset diversity.

The investigation results based on the pathology information demonstrate that the f1-scores of the predictions of the radiologist are 42.86%, 48.33% and 48.28%, meanwhile, the f1-scores of the model performance are 73.33%, 59.60% and 59.26% in the BI_RADS 2, 3 and 5 dataset samples, respectively. Also, the model can distinguish malignant from benign samples in the BI_RADS 0 category of the used dataset with an accuracy of 75.86% and correctly identify all malignant samples as BI_RADS 5. The Grad-CAM visualization shows the model pays attention to the morphological features of the lesions. Therefore, this study shows the uncertainty-aware Bayesian Deep Learning model can report his uncertainty about the malignancy of a lesion based on morphological features, like a radiologist.'}

However, they often require extensive training in low-resource settings with inaccessible infrastructure. Small or compact models, though more efficient, frequently lack sufficient support for underrepresented languages, leaving a performance gap in critical domains. This work explores the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning of compact open-weight language models to handle reasoning-intensive tasks in the underrepresented Ukrainian language, building on the findings of the ZNO-Eval benchmark. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLaMA 3.1 (8 billion parameters), LLaMA 3.2 (3 billion parameters), and Gemma 2 (9 billion parameters) models on chain-of-thought solutions resulted in a modest test score improvement of up to 17.4% on complex matching tasks and 1.6% overall compared to tuning on answer letters alone, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. In addition, the proposed tuning method with joint task topic and step-by-step solution generation outperforms standard chain-of-thought tuning in matching tasks and provides a 5.4% gain over the best LLaMA 3.2 model due to guiding the model to recall and apply domain-relevant information. Contrasting obtained results with zero-shot evaluations of leading open-weight and proprietary models such as Qwen, DeepSeek R1, OpenAI o1 and o3, Gemini, and Claude, highlight that fine-tuning LLaMA and Gemma models with 2,032 step-by-step solutions and 20 to 50 million trainable parameters on a single A100 GPU lets them outperform GPT-4o mini, Mistral Large, and larger open-weight models.

It compares texts generated by two LLMs and produces a similarity score, indicating the overall degree of similarity between their responses. The main advantage of this framework is that it can operate on a small number of unlabeled data, such as chatbot instruction prompts, and does not require LLM developers to disclose any information about their product.\nTo evaluate the efficacy of ConSCompF, two experiments aimed at identifying similarities between multiple LLMs are conducted. Additionally, these experiments examine the correlation between the similarity scores generated by ConSCompF and the differences in the outputs produced by other benchmarking techniques, such as ROUGE-L. Finally, a series of few-shot LLM comparison experiments is conducted to evaluate the performance of ConSCompF in a few-shot LLM comparison scenario.\nThe proposed framework can be used for calculating similarity matrices of multiple LLMs, which can be effectively visualized using principal component analysis (PCA).

To address these challenges, MedSAM, a large-scale medical segmentation model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), was developed to enhance segmentation accuracy by integrating image features with user-provided prompts. While MedSAM has demonstrated strong performance across various medical segmentation tasks, it primarily relies on geometric prompts (e.g., points and bounding boxes) and lacks support for text-based prompts, which could help specify subtle or ambiguous anatomical structures. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Organ-aware Multi-scale Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation Model (OMT-SAM) for multi-organ segmentation.

Predicting these behaviours is challenging due to complex biological interactions and the difficulty of obtaining high-quality experimental datasets. Existing AI-driven approaches rely heavily on data-driven learning but fail to integrate crucial knowledge about NP properties and biodistribution mechanisms. We introduce a multi-view deep learning framework that enhances pharmacokinetic predictions by incorporating prior knowledge of key NP properties such as size and charge into a cross-attention mechanism, enabling context-aware feature selection and improving generalization despite small datasets. To further enhance prediction robustness, we employ an ensemble learning approach, combining deep learning with XGBoost (XGB) and Random Forest (RF), which significantly outperforms existing AI models. Our interpretability analysis reveals key physicochemical properties driving NP biodistribution, providing biologically meaningful insights into possible mechanisms governing NP behaviour in vivo rather than a black-box model. Furthermore, by bridging machine learning with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling, this work lays the foundation for data-efficient AI-driven drug discovery and precision nanomedicine.'}

Metaxas', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13794', 'abstract': 'Large foundation models trained on large-scale visual-text data can significantly enhance Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) through data generation. However, this may lead to biased synthetic data and overfitting to specific configurations. It can sidestep biases of manually curated data generation by directly leveraging hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs), which is surprisingly rarely explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of a MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge transfer from LLMs to object detectors, an new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We demonstrate that intermediate hidden states from early LLM layers retain strong spatial-semantic correlations that are beneficial to grounding tasks. Experiments show that our adaptation strategy significantly enhances the performance on complex free-form text queries while remaining the same on plain categories. With our adaptation, Qwen2-0.5B with Swin-T as the vision encoder improves GroundingDINO by 2.33% on Omnilabel, at the overhead of 8.7% more GFLOPs. Qwen2-0.5B with a larger vision encoder can further boost the performance by 6.22%. We further validate our design by ablating on varied adapter architectures, sizes of LLMs, and which layers to add adaptation.'}

However, the landscape of trust-related concepts in LLMs in SE is relatively unclear, with concepts such as trust, distrust, and trustworthiness lacking clear conceptualizations in the SE community. To bring clarity to the current research status and identify opportunities for future work, we conducted a comprehensive review of $88$ papers: a systematic literature review of $18$ papers focused on LLMs in SE, complemented by an analysis of 70 papers from broader trust literature. Additionally, we conducted a survey study with 25 domain experts to gain insights into practitioners' understanding of trust and identify gaps between existing literature and developers' perceptions.

Analyzing the frameworks architectural documentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural trade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific needs. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural components to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show that both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make intentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the experimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and scalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single Responsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy aligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and composition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional deviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research discovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context, as performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from traditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to understanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions in modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design choices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.'}

However, it remains challenging for bushy plants like dwarf tomatoes due to their complex canopies. Traditional methods are often labor-intensive, damaging to plants, or limited in capturing canopy complexity. This study evaluated a non-destructive method combining sequential 3D reconstructions from RGB images and machine learning to estimate TLA for three dwarf tomato cultivars: Mohamed, Hahms Gelbe Topftomate, and Red Robin -- grown under controlled greenhouse conditions. Two experiments (spring-summer and autumn-winter) included 73 plants, yielding 418 TLA measurements via an "onion" approach. High-resolution videos were recorded, and 500 frames per plant were used for 3D reconstruction. Point clouds were processed using four algorithms (Alpha Shape, Marching Cubes, Poisson\'s, Ball Pivoting), and meshes were evaluated with seven regression models: Multivariable Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron. The Alpha Shape reconstruction ($\\alpha = 3$) with Extreme Gradient Boosting achieved the best performance ($R^2 = 0.80$, $MAE = 489 cm^2$). Cross-experiment validation showed robust results ($R^2 = 0.56$, $MAE = 579 cm^2$). Feature importance analysis identified height, width, and surface area as key predictors. This scalable, automated TLA estimation method is suited for urban farming and precision agriculture, offering applications in automated pruning, resource efficiency, and sustainable food production.

Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing.

Specifically, the body scale and bone lengths of the skeleton should be adjusted in accordance with the size and proportions of the mesh, ensuring that all joints are accurately positioned within the character mesh. Furthermore, defining skinning weights is complicated by variations in skeletal configurations, such as the number of joints and their hierarchy, as well as differences in mesh configurations, including their connectivity and shapes. While existing approaches have made efforts to automate this process, they hardly address the variations in both skeletal and mesh configurations. In this paper, we present a novel method for the automatic rigging and skinning of character meshes using skeletal motion data, accommodating arbitrary configurations of both meshes and skeletons. The proposed method predicts the optimal skeleton aligned with the size and proportion of the mesh as well as defines skinning weights for various mesh-skeleton configurations, without requiring explicit supervision tailored to each of them. By incorporating Diffusion 3D Features (Diff3F) as semantic descriptors of character meshes, our method achieves robust generalization across different configurations.

In this applied research study, we present a stride-level classification system that utilizes a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to objectively differentiate between sound and lame horses, with a primary focus on the trot gait. The proposed system was tested under real-world conditions, achieving a 90% session-level accuracy with no false positives, demonstrating its robustness for practical applications. By employing a single, non-intrusive, and readily available sensor, our approach significantly reduces the complexity and cost of hardware requirements while maintaining high classification performance. These results highlight the potential of our CNN-based method as a field-tested, scalable solution for automated lameness detection.

However, finetuning on LLMs will diminish this general skills and continual finetuning will further cause severe degradation on accumulated knowledge. Recently, Continual Learning (CL) in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises which aims to continually adapt the LLMs to new tasks while maintaining previously learned knowledge and inheriting general skills. Existing techniques either leverage previous data to replay, leading to extra computational costs, or utilize a single parameter-efficient module to learn the downstream task, constraining new knowledge absorption with interference between different tasks. Toward these issues, this paper proposes Analytic Subspace Routing(ASR) to address these challenges. For each task, we isolate the learning within a subspace of deep layers' features via low-rank adaptation, eliminating knowledge interference between different tasks. Additionally, we propose an analytic routing mechanism to properly utilize knowledge learned in different subspaces. Our approach employs Recursive Least Squares to train a multi-task router model, allowing the router to dynamically adapt to incoming data without requiring access to historical data. Also, the router effectively assigns the current task to an appropriate subspace and has a non-forgetting property of previously learned tasks with a solid theoretical guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves near-perfect retention of prior knowledge while seamlessly integrating new information, effectively overcoming the core limitations of existing methods. Our code will be released after acceptance."}

To that end, we merge two common practical methods to reduce inertial drift: a wheel-mounted approach and driving the mobile robot in periodic trajectories.

To evaluate our proposed approach we recorded using the Rosbot-XL a wheel-mounted initial dataset totaling 190 minutes, which is made publicly available.

In a typical SD setup, the idea is to use a full-precision, small, fast model as "draft" to generate the next few tokens and use the "target" large model to verify the draft-generated tokens. The efficacy of this method heavily relies on the acceptance ratio of the draft-generated tokens and the relative token throughput of the draft versus the target model. Nevertheless, an efficient SD pipeline requires pre-training and aligning the draft model to the target model, making it impractical for LLM inference in a plug-and-play fashion. In this work, we propose using MXFP4 models as drafts in a plug-and-play fashion since the MXFP4 Weight-Only-Quantization (WOQ) merely direct-casts the BF16 target model weights to MXFP4. In practice, our plug-and-play solution gives speedups up to 2x over the BF16 baseline. Then we pursue an opportunity for further acceleration: the MXFP4 draft token generation itself can be accelerated via speculative decoding by using yet another smaller draft. We call our method ML-SpecQD: Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with Quantized Drafts since it recursively applies speculation for accelerating the draft-token generation. Combining Multi-Level Speculative Decoding with MXFP4 Quantized Drafts we outperform state-of-the-art speculative decoding, yielding speedups up to 2.72x over the BF16 baseline.'}

To address these challenges, we propose transforming the coarse-grained positive-negative (PN) classification task into an imbalanced fine-grained positive-unlabeled (PU) classification problem, supported by theoretical analysis. We introduce a novel framework, Balanced Fine-Grained Positive-Unlabeled (BFGPU) learning, which features a unique PU learning loss function that optimizes macro-level performance amidst severe imbalance at the micro level.

Our previous work proposed an adaptive potential function (APF) and showed that APF can accelerate the Q-learning with a Multi-layer Perceptron algorithm in the low-dimensional domain. This paper proposes to extend APF with an encoder (APF+) for RL state representation, allowing applying APF to the pixel-based Atari games using a state-encoding method that projects high-dimensional game's pixel frames to low-dimensional embeddings. We approach by designing the state-representation encoder as a W-shaped network (W-Net), by using which we are able to encode both the background as well as the moving entities in the game frames. Specifically, the embeddings derived from the pre-trained W-Net consist of two latent vectors: One represents the input state, and the other represents the deviation of the input state's representation from itself. We then incorporate W-Net into APF to train a downstream Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN), obtain the APF-WNet-DDQN, and demonstrate its effectiveness in Atari game-playing tasks. To evaluate the APF+W-Net module in such high-dimensional tasks, we compare with two types of baseline methods: (i) the basic DDQN; and (ii) two encoder-replaced APF-DDQN methods where we replace W-Net by (a) an unsupervised state representation method called Spatiotemporal Deep Infomax (ST-DIM) and (b) a ground truth state representation provided by the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (ARI). The experiment results show that out of 20 Atari games, APF-WNet-DDQN outperforms DDQN (14/20 games) and APF-STDIM-DDQN (13/20 games) significantly. In comparison against the APF-ARI-DDQN which employs embeddings directly of the detailed game-internal state information, the APF-WNet-DDQN achieves a comparable performance."}

This article argues that the juxtaposition of the two phenomena helps to reveal that they both share two fundamental traits as both elevate form and appearance over substance and content, and users of both routinely mistake the form for the substance. In drawing upon legal theory, computer science, linguistics and cognitive psychology, the article argues that both phenomena rely upon creating illusions of meaning that users mistake for the underlying primary phenomenon. I then explore four implications of this conception of both phenomena. Firstly, both rely on human tendencies of conceptual pareidolia resulting in the erroneous perception of meaningful linguistic legal patterns from nebulous inputs. Secondly, both rely upon the confidence heuristic, the human cognitive bias for treating confidence as a proxy for competence. Thirdly, both succeed when the primary concern is with the form of the output and not its content. Fourthly, both rely heavily upon the magical thinking of users and the desire for the promise of the approach to be real. The article argues that the legal context helps to reveal a solution for the problems caused by both phenomena as it is only where users possess sufficient legal and technological literacy that it becomes possible to reveal to them the illusionary nature of the phenomena.'}

Furthermore, to address the inefficiency of autonomous generating PRM training data via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we introduce a lightweight and effective data augmentation strategy called Hierarchical Node Compression (HNC) based on node merging (combining two consecutive reasoning steps into one step) in the tree structure. This approach diversifies MCTS results for HRM with negligible computational overhead, enhancing label robustness by introducing noise. Empirical results on the PRM800K dataset demonstrate that HRM, in conjunction with HNC, achieves superior stability and reliability in evaluation compared to PRM. Furthermore, cross-domain evaluations on MATH500 and GSM8K confirm HRM's superior generalization and robustness across diverse reasoning tasks. The code for all experiments will be released at https: //github.com/tengwang0318/hierarchial_reward_model."}

Current mainstream representation learning methods primarily rely on non-linear data mining techniques such as kernel methods and deep neural networks to extract abstract knowledge from complex datasets. However, most of these methods are black-box, lacking transparency and interpretability in the learning process, which constrains their practical utility. To this end, this paper introduces a novel representation learning method grounded in an interpretable fuzzy rule-based model. Specifically, it is built upon the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) to initially map input data to a high-dimensional fuzzy feature space through the antecedent part of the TSK-FS. Subsequently, a novel differentiable optimization method is proposed for the consequence part learning which can preserve the model's interpretability and transparency while further exploring the nonlinear relationships within the data. This optimization method retains the essence of traditional optimization, with certain parts of the process parameterized corresponding differentiable modules constructed, and a deep optimization process implemented. Consequently, this method not only enhances the model's performance but also ensures its interpretability. Moreover, a second-order geometry preservation method is introduced to further improve the robustness of the proposed method. Extensive experiments conducted on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed method, highlighting its potential for advancing representation learning methodologies."}

In FedPL, clients collaboratively construct a set of global feature centers (prototypes), and let local features align with these prototypes to mitigate the effects of data heterogeneity. The performance of FedPL highly depends on the quality of prototypes. Existing methods assume that larger inter-class distances among prototypes yield better performance, and thus design different methods to increase these distances. However, we observe that while these methods increase prototype distances to enhance class discrimination, they inevitably disrupt essential semantic relationships among classes, which are crucial for model generalization. This raises an important question: how to construct prototypes that inherently preserve semantic relationships among classes? Directly learning these relationships from limited and heterogeneous client data can be problematic in FL. Recently, the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) demonstrates their ability to capture semantic relationships from vast textual corpora. Motivated by this, we propose FedTSP, a novel method that leverages PLMs to construct semantically enriched prototypes from the textual modality, enabling more effective collaboration in heterogeneous data settings. We first use a large language model (LLM) to generate fine-grained textual descriptions for each class, which are then processed by a PLM on the server to form textual prototypes. To address the modality gap between client image models and the PLM, we introduce trainable prompts, allowing prototypes to adapt better to client tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTSP mitigates data heterogeneity while significantly accelerating convergence.'}

To address this critical challenge, inspired by the success of DoReMi in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a data mixture optimization strategy for pre-training HAR models, aiming to improve the recognition performance across heterogeneous datasets. However, directly applying DoReMi to the HAR field encounters new challenges due to the continuous, multi-channel and intrinsic heterogeneous characteristics of IMU sensor data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework HAR-DoReMi, which introduces a masked reconstruction task based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss. By raplacing the discrete language sequence prediction task, which relies on the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) loss, in the original DoReMi framework, the proposed framework is inherently more appropriate for handling the continuous and multi-channel characteristics of IMU data. In addition, HAR-DoReMi integrates the Mahony fusion algorithm into the self-supervised HAR pre-training, aiming to mitigate the heterogeneity of varying sensor orientation. This is achieved by estimating the sensor orientation within each dataset and facilitating alignment with a unified coordinate system, thereby improving the cross-dataset generalization ability of the HAR model. Experimental evaluation on multiple cross-dataset HAR transfer tasks demonstrates that HAR-DoReMi improves the accuracy by an average of 6.51%, compared to the current state-of-the-art method with only approximately 30% to 50% of the data usage. These results confirm the effectiveness of HAR-DoReMi in improving the generalization and data efficiency of pre-training HAR models, underscoring its significant potential to facilitate the practical deployment of HAR technology.'}

Predominant methods, such as RLHF, involve multiple steps, each demanding distinct types of data, including demonstration data and preference data. In RLHF, human preferences are typically modeled through a reward model, which serves as a proxy to guide policy learning during the reinforcement learning stage, ultimately producing a policy aligned with human preferences. However, in this paper, we propose a fresh perspective on learning alignment based on inverse reinforcement learning principles, where the optimal policy is still derived from reward maximization. However, instead of relying on preference data, we directly learn the reward model from demonstration data. This new formulation offers the flexibility to be applied even when only demonstration data is available, a capability that current RLHF methods lack, and it also shows that demonstration data offers more utility than what conventional wisdom suggests. Our extensive evaluation, based on public reward benchmark, HuggingFace Open LLM Leaderboard and MT-Bench, demonstrates that our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods that rely solely on demonstration data.'}

The use of GAI to support learning is becoming increasingly prevalent among students. However, the manner and extent of its utilisation vary considerably from one individual to another. And researches about student's utilisation and perceptions of GAI remains relatively scarce. To gain insight into the issue, this paper proposed a hybrid-survey method to examine the impact of GAI on students across four different grades in six key areas (LIPSAL): learning interest, independent learning, problem solving, self-confidence, appropriate use, and learning enjoyment. Firstly, through questionnaire, we found that among LIPSAL, GAI has the greatest impact on the concept of appropriate use, the lowest level of learning interest and self-confidence. Secondly, a comparison of four grades revealed that the high and low factors of LIPSAL exhibited grade-related variation, and college students exhibited a higher level than high school students across LIPSAL. Thirdly, through interview, the students demonstrated a comprehensive understanding of the application of GAI. We found that students have a positive attitude towards GAI and are very willing to use it, which is why GAI has grown so rapidly in popularity. They also told us prospects and challenges in using GAI. In the future, as GAI matures technologically, it will have an greater impact on students. These findings may help better understand usage by different students and inform future research in digital education."}

Additionally, crafting fully unbiased natural language prompts remains a challenge for humans. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Examples as the Prompt (EaP) which leverages labeled data to enhance prompts. Specifically, EaP automatically selects the most representative examples to maximize the few-shot capability of LLMs. It is efficient due to its unsupervised example selection and adaptive to potential data distribution shifts. We validate EaP on four real-world production use cases, demonstrating that it achieves comparable or even superior performance comparing to hand-crafted prompts designed by domain experts. Additionally, we introduce EaP_lite, which entirely replaces the natural language components of prompts with labeled examples.

This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However, existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods, while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.'}

Directly generating a series of images using text-to-image models without considering the context of previous steps results in inconsistent images, increasing cognitive load. Additionally, the generated images often miss objects or the attributes such as color, shape, and state of the objects are inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose LIGER, the first training-free framework for Long-horizon Instruction GEneration with logic and attribute self-Reflection. LIGER first generates a draft image for each step with the historical prompt and visual memory of previous steps. This step-by-step generation approach maintains consistency between images in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, LIGER utilizes various image editing tools to rectify errors including wrong attributes, logic errors, object redundancy, and identity inconsistency in the draft images. Through this self-reflection mechanism, LIGER improves the logic and object attribute correctness of the images. To verify whether the generated images assist human understanding, we manually curated a new benchmark consisting of various long-horizon tasks. Human-annotated ground truth expressions reflect the human-defined criteria for how an image should appear to be illustrative. Experiments demonstrate the visual instructions generated by LIGER are more comprehensive compared with baseline methods.'}

However, due to high vehicle mobility and finite communication coverage of base stations, it is hard to maintain uninterrupted and high-quality services without proper service migration among MEC servers. Existing solutions commonly rely on prior knowledge and rarely consider efficient resource allocation during the service migration process, making it hard to reach optimal performance in dynamic IoV environments. To address these important challenges, we propose SR-CL, a novel mobility-aware seamless Service migration and Resource allocation framework via Convex-optimization-enabled deep reinforcement Learning in multi-edge IoV systems. First, we decouple the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem of service migration and resource allocation into two sub-problems. Next, we design a new actor-critic-based asynchronous-update deep reinforcement learning method to handle service migration, where the delayed-update actor makes migration decisions and the one-step-update critic evaluates the decisions to guide the policy update. Notably, we theoretically derive the optimal resource allocation with convex optimization for each MEC server, thereby further improving system performance. Using the real-world datasets of vehicle trajectories and testbed, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SR-CL. Compared to benchmark methods, the SR-CL achieves superior convergence and delay performance under various scenarios.'}

However traditional methods often require data transmission to centralized processing unit with substantial computational resources after collecting it from edge devices. Neuromorphic computing is an emerging field that seeks to design specialized hardware for computing systems inspired by the structure, function, and dynamics of the human brain, offering significant advantages in latency and power consumption. This paper explores a novel neuromorphic implementation approach for gesture recognition by extracting spatiotemporal spiking information from surface electromyography (sEMG) data in an event-driven manner. At the same time, the network was designed by implementing a simple-structured and hardware-friendly Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) framework called Rotating Neuron Reservoir (RNR) within the domain of Spiking neural network (SNN). The spiking RNR (sRNR) is promising to pipeline an innovative solution to compact embedded wearable systems, enabling low-latency, real-time processing directly at the sensor level. The proposed system was validated by an open-access large-scale sEMG database and achieved an average classification accuracy of 74.6\\% and 80.3\\% using a classical machine learning classifier and a delta learning rule algorithm respectively. While the delta learning rule could be fully spiking and implementable on neuromorphic chips, the proposed gesture recognition system demonstrates the potential for near-sensor low-latency processing.'}

This study evaluates the application of a deep learning keypoint and object detection model, YOLOv8-pose, for the automatic identification of localised periodontal bone loss landmarks, conditions and staging. YOLOv8-pose was fine-tuned on 193 annotated periapical radiographs. We propose a keypoint detection metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), which normalises the metric to the average tooth size of teeth in the image. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that adjusts certain keypoint predictions to align with the edge of the related tooth, using a supporting instance segmentation model trained on an open source auxiliary dataset. The model can sufficiently detect bone loss keypoints, tooth boxes, and alveolar ridge resorption, but has insufficient performance at detecting detached periodontal ligament and furcation involvement. The model with post-processing demonstrated a PRCK 0.25 of 0.726 and PRCK 0.05 of 0.401 for keypoint detection, mAP 0.5 of 0.715 for tooth object detection, mesial dice score of 0.593 for periodontal staging, and dice score of 0.280 for furcation involvement. Our annotation methodology provides a stage agnostic approach to periodontal disease detection, by ensuring most keypoints are present for each tooth in the image, allowing small imbalanced datasets. Our PRCK metric allows accurate evaluation of keypoints in dental domains. Our post-processing module adjusts predicted keypoints correctly but is dependent on a minimum quality of prediction by the pose detection and segmentation models. Code: https:// this http URL.

However, existing models primarily focus on binary classification (depression/normal), lacking granularity for severity assessment. To address this, we proposed the DepL-GCN, i.e., Depression Level classification based on GCN model. This model tackles two key challenges: (1) subjectivity in depres-sion-level labeling due to patient self-report biases, and (2) class imbalance across severity categories. Inspired by the model learning patterns, we introduced two novel modules: the sample confidence module and the minority sample penalty module. The former leverages the L2-norm of prediction errors to progressively filter EEG samples with weak label alignment during training, thereby reducing the impact of subjectivity; the latter automatically upweights misclassified minority-class samples to address imbalance issues. After testing on two public EEG datasets, DepL-GCN achieved accuracies of 81.13% and 81.36% for multi-class severity recognition, outperforming baseline this http URL studies confirmed both modules' contributions.

A total of 3,245 images were collected from the experimental tower of H Company, the leading elevator manufacturer in South Korea, and the detection performance was evaluated using four experimental approaches (GCH, GSCH, GECH, FCH). During the initial image processing stage, Gaussian blurring, sharpening filter, embossing filter, and Fourier Transform were applied, followed by Canny Edge Detection and Hough Transform. Notably, the method was developed to accurately extract the reference line by averaging the x-coordinates of the lines detected through the Hough Transform. This approach enabled the detection of the 0.2 mm thick piano wire with high accuracy, even in the presence of noise and other interfering factors (e.g., concrete cracks inside the elevator shaft or safety bars for filming equipment). The experimental results showed that Experiment 4 (FCH), which utilized Fourier Transform in the preprocessing stage, achieved the highest detection rate for the LtoL, LtoR, and RtoL datasets. Experiment 2(GSCH), which applied Gaussian blurring and a sharpening filter, demonstrated superior detection performance on the RtoR dataset.

Yet research on Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) remains fragmented: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews and surveys often remain at a broad, conceptual level, making it difficult to synthesize deeper insights into the underlying algorithms and representations, and their respective success. We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review of how CMAs model, store, remember and process their metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979) three foundational components of metacognition. Following this organizing principle, we identify 35 CMAs that feature episodic introspective data ranging from symbolic event traces to sub-symbolic arousal metrics. We consider different aspects - ranging from the underlying psychological theories to the content and structure of collected data, to the algorithms used and evaluation results - and derive a unifying perspective that allows us to compare in depth how different Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) leverage metacognitive experiences for tasks such as error diagnosis, self-repair, and goal-driven learning. Our findings highlight both the promise of metacognitive experiences - in boosting adaptability, explainability, and overall system performance - and the persistent lack of shared standards or evaluation benchmarks."}

One of the tools that can be useful in this perspective is dataset documentation. The aim of this work is to investigate the state of dataset documentation practices, measuring the completeness of the documentation of several popular datasets in ML/AI repositories. We created a dataset documentation schema -- the Documentation Test Sheet (DTS) -- that identifies the information that should always be attached to a dataset (to ensure proper dataset choice and informed use), according to relevant studies in the literature.

In this work, we tackle the challenge of generating datasets with high diversity, upon which a student model is trained for downstream tasks. Taking the route of decoding-time guidance-based approaches, we propose CorrSynth, which generates data that is more diverse and faithful to the input prompt using a correlated sampling strategy. Further, our method overcomes the complexity drawbacks of some other guidance-based techniques like classifier-based guidance. With extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our approach and substantiate our claims. In particular, we perform intrinsic evaluation to show the improvements in diversity.

Our study evaluates the effectiveness and computational overhead of three generative strategies based on diffusion models, namely instruction-editing, inpainting, and inpainting with refinement. Specifically, we assess these techniques' capabilities to produce augmented simulator-generated images of driving scenarios representing new ODDs. We employ a novel automated detector for invalid inputs based on semantic segmentation to ensure semantic preservation and realism of the neural generated images. We then perform system-level testing to evaluate the ADS's generalization ability to newly synthesized ODDs. Our findings show that diffusion models help increase the ODD coverage for system-level testing of ADS. Our automated semantic validator achieved a percentage of false positives as low as 3%, retaining the correctness and quality of the generated images for testing. Our approach successfully identified new ADS system failures before real-world testing."}
