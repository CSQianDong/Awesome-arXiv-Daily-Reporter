**Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components, retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query, retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic, learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

# Retrieval-Augmented Review Generation for Poisoning Recommender Systems

**Abstract**: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and imperceptibility under the practical setting.
To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

**Abstract**: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help, but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from large-scale data through RL.
Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses.

# Conflict-Aware Soft Prompting for Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Eunseong Choi, June Park, Hyeri Lee, Jongwuk Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15253)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

# First RAG, Second SEG: A Training-Free Paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection 

**Authors**: Wutao Liu, YiDan Wang, Pan Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15313)  

**Abstract**: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements.
