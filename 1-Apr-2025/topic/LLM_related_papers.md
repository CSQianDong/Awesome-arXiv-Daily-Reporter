**Authors**: Shuo Ren, Pu Jian, Zhenjiang Ren, Chunlin Leng, Can Xie, Jiajun Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24047)  

**Abstract**: As scientific research becomes increasingly complex, innovative tools are needed to manage vast data, facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration, and accelerate discovery. Large language models (LLMs) are now evolving into LLM-based scientific agents that automate critical tasks, ranging from hypothesis generation and experiment design to data analysis and simulation. Unlike general-purpose LLMs, these specialized agents integrate domain-specific knowledge, advanced tool sets, and robust validation mechanisms, enabling them to handle complex data types, ensure reproducibility, and drive scientific breakthroughs. This survey provides a focused review of the architectures, design, benchmarks, applications, and ethical considerations surrounding LLM-based scientific agents. We highlight why they differ from general agents and the ways in which they advance research across various scientific fields. By examining their development and challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap for researchers and practitioners to harness these agents for more efficient, reliable, and ethically sound scientific discovery.

# Pay More Attention to the Robustness of Prompt for Instruction Data Mining 

**Authors**: Qiang Wang, Dawei Feng, Xu Zhang, Ao Shen, Yang Xu, Bo Ding, Huaimin Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24028)  

**Abstract**: Instruction tuning has emerged as a paramount method for tailoring the behaviors of LLMs. Recent work has unveiled the potential for LLMs to achieve high performance through fine-tuning with a limited quantity of high-quality instruction data. Building upon this approach, we further explore the impact of prompt's robustness on the selection of high-quality instruction data. This paper proposes a pioneering framework of high-quality online instruction data mining for instruction tuning, focusing on the impact of prompt's robustness on the data mining process. Our notable innovation, is to generate the adversarial instruction data by conducting the attack for the prompt of online instruction data. Then, we introduce an Adversarial Instruction-Following Difficulty metric to measure how much help the adversarial instruction data can provide to the generation of the corresponding response. Apart from it, we propose a novel Adversarial Instruction Output Embedding Consistency approach to select high-quality online instruction data. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets to assess the performance. The experimental results serve to underscore the effectiveness of our proposed two methods. Moreover, the results underscore the critical practical significance of considering prompt's robustness.

**Abstract**: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcend the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five levels of autonomy, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the ethical and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance solutions to pressing global challenges.

# Grounding Agent Reasoning in Image Schemas: A Neurosymbolic Approach to Embodied Cognition 

**Authors**: François Olivier, Zied Bouraoui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24110)  

**Abstract**: Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.

# Benchmarking Systematic Relational Reasoning with Large Language and Reasoning Models 

**Authors**: Irtaza Khalid, Amir Masoud Nourollah, Steven Schockaert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23487)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is still known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond problem solving in mathematics and programming, where finding genuine out-of-distribution problems can be difficult. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic reasoning about relational compositions, especially for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. These tasks allow us to control the difficulty of problem instances, and measure in a precise way to what extent models can generalise. We find that that the considered LLMs and LRMs overall perform poorly overall, albeit better than random chance.

# Large Language Models Are Better Logical Fallacy Reasoners with Counterargument, Explanation, and Goal-Aware Prompt Formulation 

**Authors**: Jiwon Jeong, Hyeju Jang, Hogun Park  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23363)  

**Abstract**: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has greatly improved our ability to process complex language. However, accurately detecting logical fallacies remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel and effective prompt formulation approach for logical fallacy detection, applicable in both supervised (fine-tuned) and unsupervised (zero-shot) settings. Our method enriches input text incorporating implicit contextual information -- counterarguments, explanations, and goals -- which we query for validity within the context of the argument. We then rank these queries based on confidence scores to inform classification. We evaluate our approach across multiple datasets from 5 domains, covering 29 distinct fallacy types, using models from the GPT and LLaMA series. The results show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art models, with F1 score increases of up to 0.60 in zero-shot settings and up to 0.45 in fine-tuned models. Extensive analyses further illustrate why and how our method excels.

# A Scalable Framework for Evaluating Health Language Models 

**Authors**: Neil Mallinar, A. Ali Heydari, Xin Liu, Anthony Z. Faranesh, Brent Winslow, Nova Hammerquist, Benjamin Graef, Cathy Speed, Mark Malhotra, Shwetak Patel, Javier L. Prieto, Daniel McDuff, Ahmed A. Metwally  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23339)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing complex datasets. Recent studies demonstrate their potential to generate useful, personalized responses when provided with patient-specific health information that encompasses lifestyle, biomarkers, and context. As LLM-driven health applications are increasingly adopted, rigorous and efficient one-sided evaluation methodologies are crucial to ensure response quality across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, personalization and safety. Current evaluation practices for open-ended text responses heavily rely on human experts. This approach introduces human factors and is often cost-prohibitive, labor-intensive, and hinders scalability, especially in complex domains like healthcare where response assessment necessitates domain expertise and considers multifaceted patient data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics: an evaluation framework that streamlines human and automated evaluation of open-ended questions by identifying gaps in model responses using a minimal set of targeted rubrics questions. Our approach is based on recent work in more general evaluation settings that contrasts a smaller set of complex evaluation targets with a larger set of more precise, granular targets answerable with simple boolean responses. We validate this approach in metabolic health, a domain encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics yield higher inter-rater agreement among expert and non-expert human evaluators, and in automated assessments, compared to traditional Likert scales, while requiring approximately half the evaluation time of Likert-based methods. This enhanced efficiency, particularly in automated evaluation and non-expert contributions, paves the way for more extensive and cost-effective evaluation of LLMs in health.

# AI Agents in Engineering Design: A Multi-Agent Framework for Aesthetic and Aerodynamic Car Design 

**Authors**: Mohamed Elrefaie, Janet Qian, Raina Wu, Qian Chen, Angela Dai, Faez Ahmed  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23315)  

**Abstract**: We introduce the concept of "Design Agents" for engineering applications, particularly focusing on the automotive design process, while emphasizing that our approach can be readily extended to other engineering and design domains. Our framework integrates AI-driven design agents into the traditional engineering workflow, demonstrating how these specialized computational agents interact seamlessly with engineers and designers to augment creativity, enhance efficiency, and significantly accelerate the overall design cycle. By automating and streamlining tasks traditionally performed manually, such as conceptual sketching, styling enhancements, 3D shape retrieval and generative modeling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing, and aerodynamic simulations, our approach reduces certain aspects of the conventional workflow from weeks and days down to minutes. These agents leverage state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), large language models (LLMs), and geometric deep learning techniques, providing rapid iteration and comprehensive design exploration capabilities. We ground our methodology in industry-standard benchmarks, encompassing a wide variety of conventional automotive designs, and utilize high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations to ensure practical and applicable outcomes. Furthermore, we present design agents that can swiftly and accurately predict simulation outcomes, empowering engineers and designers to engage in more informed design optimization and exploration. This research underscores the transformative potential of integrating advanced generative AI techniques into complex engineering tasks, paving the way for broader adoption and innovation across multiple engineering disciplines.

# GRASP: Municipal Budget AI Chatbots for Enhancing Civic Engagement 

**Authors**: Jerry Xu, Justin Wang, Joley Leung, Jasmine Gu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23299)  

**Abstract**: There are a growing number of AI applications, but none tailored specifically to help residents answer their questions about municipal budget, a topic most are interested in but few have a solid comprehension of. In this research paper, we propose GRASP, a custom AI chatbot framework which stands for Generation with Retrieval and Action System for Prompts. GRASP provides more truthful and grounded responses to user budget queries than traditional information retrieval systems like general Large Language Models (LLMs) or web searches. These improvements come from the novel combination of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework ("Generation with Retrieval") and an agentic workflow ("Action System"), as well as prompt engineering techniques, the incorporation of municipal budget domain knowledge, and collaboration with local town officials to ensure response truthfulness. During testing, we found that our GRASP chatbot provided precise and accurate responses for local municipal budget queries 78% of the time, while GPT-4o and Gemini were only accurate 60% and 35% of the time, respectively. GRASP chatbots greatly reduce the time and effort needed for the general public to get an intuitive and correct understanding of their town's budget, thus fostering greater communal discourse, improving government transparency, and allowing citizens to make more informed decisions.

**Authors**: Eftychia Makri, Georgios Palaiokrassas, Sarah Bouraga, Antigoni Polychroniadou, Leandros Tassiulas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23190)  

**Abstract**: Cryptocurrencies have transformed financial markets with their innovative blockchain technology and volatile price movements, presenting both challenges and opportunities for predictive analytics. Ethereum, being one of the leading cryptocurrencies, has experienced significant market fluctuations, making its price prediction an attractive yet complex problem. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting Ethereum prices for short-term and few-shot forecasting scenarios. The main challenge in training models for time series analysis is the lack of data. We address this by leveraging a novel approach that adapts existing pre-trained LLMs on natural language or images from billions of tokens to the unique characteristics of Ethereum price time series data. Through thorough experimentation and comparison with traditional and contemporary models, our results demonstrate that selectively freezing certain layers of pre-trained LLMs achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain. This approach consistently surpasses benchmarks across multiple metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. Our research not only contributes to the existing body of knowledge on LLMs but also provides practical insights in the cryptocurrency prediction domain. The adaptability of pre-trained LLMs to handle the nature of Ethereum prices suggests a promising direction for future research, potentially including the integration of sentiment analysis to further refine forecasting accuracy.

# LLM-based Agent Simulation for Maternal Health Interventions: Uncertainty Estimation and Decision-focused Evaluation 

**Authors**: Sarah Martinson, Lingkai Kong, Cheol Woo Kim, Aparna Taneja, Milind Tambe  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22719)  

**Abstract**: Agent-based simulation is crucial for modeling complex human behavior, yet traditional approaches require extensive domain knowledge and large datasets. In data-scarce healthcare settings where historic and counterfactual data are limited, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging broad world knowledge. This study examines an LLM-driven simulation of a maternal mobile health program, predicting beneficiaries' listening behavior when they receive health information via automated messages (control) or live representatives (intervention). Since uncertainty quantification is critical for decision-making in health interventions, we propose an LLM epistemic uncertainty estimation method based on binary entropy across multiple samples. We enhance model robustness through ensemble approaches, improving F1 score and model calibration compared to individual models. Beyond direct evaluation, we take a decision-focused approach, demonstrating how LLM predictions inform intervention feasibility and trial implementation in data-limited settings. The proposed method extends to public health, disaster response, and other domains requiring rapid intervention assessment under severe data constraints.

# AstroAgents: A Multi-Agent AI for Hypothesis Generation from Mass Spectrometry Data 

**Authors**: Daniel Saeedi, Denise Buckner, Jose C. Aponte, Amirali Aghazadeh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23170)  

**Abstract**: With upcoming sample return missions across the solar system and the increasing availability of mass spectrometry data, there is an urgent need for methods that analyze such data within the context of existing astrobiology literature and generate plausible hypotheses regarding the emergence of life on Earth. Hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data is challenging due to factors such as environmental contaminants, the complexity of spectral peaks, and difficulties in cross-matching these peaks with prior studies. To address these challenges, we introduce AstroAgents, a large language model-based, multi-agent AI system for hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data. AstroAgents is structured around eight collaborative agents: a data analyst, a planner, three domain scientists, an accumulator, a literature reviewer, and a critic. The system processes mass spectrometry data alongside user-provided research papers. The data analyst interprets the data, and the planner delegates specific segments to the scientist agents for in-depth exploration. The accumulator then collects and deduplicates the generated hypotheses, and the literature reviewer identifies relevant literature using Semantic Scholar. The critic evaluates the hypotheses, offering rigorous suggestions for improvement. To assess AstroAgents, an astrobiology expert evaluated the novelty and plausibility of more than a hundred hypotheses generated from data obtained from eight meteorites and ten soil samples. Of these hypotheses, 36% were identified as plausible, and among those, 66% were novel. Project website: this https URL

# Any2Caption:Interpreting Any Condition to Caption for Controllable Video Generation 

**Authors**: Shengqiong Wu, Weicai Ye, Jiahao Wang, Quande Liu, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Kun Gai, Shuicheng Yan, Hao Fei, Tat-Seng Chua  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24379)  

**Abstract**: To address the bottleneck of accurate user intent interpretation within the current video generation community, we present Any2Caption, a novel framework for controllable video generation under any condition. The key idea is to decouple various condition interpretation steps from the video synthesis step. By leveraging modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs), Any2Caption interprets diverse inputs--text, images, videos, and specialized cues such as region, motion, and camera poses--into dense, structured captions that offer backbone video generators with better guidance. We also introduce Any2CapIns, a large-scale dataset with 337K instances and 407K conditions for any-condition-to-caption instruction tuning. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements of our system in controllability and video quality across various aspects of existing video generation models.

# Factored Agents: Decoupling In-Context Learning and Memorization for Robust Tool Use 

**Authors**: Nicholas Roth, Christopher Hidey, Lucas Spangher, William F. Arnold, Chang Ye, Nick Masiewicki, Jinoo Baek, Peter Grabowski, Eugene Ie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22931)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a novel factored agent architecture designed to overcome the limitations of traditional single-agent systems in agentic AI. Our approach decomposes the agent into two specialized components: (1) a large language model (LLM) that serves as a high level planner and in-context learner, which may use dynamically available information in user prompts, (2) a smaller language model which acts as a memorizer of tool format and output. This decoupling addresses prevalent issues in monolithic designs, including malformed, missing, and hallucinated API fields, as well as suboptimal planning in dynamic environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our factored architecture significantly improves planning accuracy and error resilience, while elucidating the inherent trade-off between in-context learning and static memorization. These findings suggest that a factored approach is a promising pathway for developing more robust and adaptable agentic AI systems.

# SPIO: Ensemble and Selective Strategies via LLM-Based Multi-Agent Planning in Automated Data Science 

**Authors**: Wonduk Seo, Juhyeon Lee, Yi Bu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23314)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized automated data analytics and machine learning by enabling dynamic reasoning and adaptability. While recent approaches have advanced multi-stage pipelines through multi-agent systems, they typically rely on rigid, single-path workflows that limit the exploration and integration of diverse strategies, often resulting in suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.

# Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention 

**Authors**: Tong Wu, Chong Xiang, Jiachen T. Wang, Prateek Mittal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24370)  

**Abstract**: Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs.

# Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Rui Wang, Hongru Wang, Boyang Xue, Jianhui Pang, Shudong Liu, Yi Chen, Jiahao Qiu, Derek Fai Wong, Heng Ji, Kam-Fai Wong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24377)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.

# BEATS: Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite for Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Alok Abhishek, Lisa Erickson, Tushar Bandopadhyay  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24310)  

**Abstract**: In this research, we introduce BEATS, a novel framework for evaluating Bias, Ethics, Fairness, and Factuality in Large Language Models (LLMs). Building upon the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially responsible and ethically aligned AI models.

# ORAL: Prompting Your Large-Scale LoRAs via Conditional Recurrent Diffusion 

**Authors**: Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan, Dongwen Tang, Pingzhi Li, Kai Wang, Tianlong Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24354)  

**Abstract**: Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts.

# A Systematic Evaluation of LLM Strategies for Mental Health Text Analysis: Fine-tuning vs. Prompt Engineering vs. RAG 

**Authors**: Arshia Kermani, Veronica Perez-Rosas, Vangelis Metsis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24307)  

**Abstract**: This study presents a systematic comparison of three approaches for the analysis of mental health text using large language models (LLMs): prompt engineering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning. Using LLaMA 3, we evaluate these approaches on emotion classification and mental health condition detection tasks across two datasets. Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy). Our findings provide practical insights for implementing LLM-based solutions in mental health applications, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy, computational requirements, and deployment flexibility.

# Exploring the Effect of Reinforcement Learning on Video Understanding: Insights from SEED-Bench-R1 

**Authors**: Yi Chen, Yuying Ge, Rui Wang, Yixiao Ge, Lu Qiu, Ying Shan, Xihui Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24376)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Chain of Thought (COT) generation have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as an effective post-training approach. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inherit this reasoning potential but remain underexplored in tasks requiring both perception and logical reasoning. To address this, we introduce SEED-Bench-R1, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate post-training methods for MLLMs in video understanding. It includes intricate real-world videos and complex everyday planning tasks in the format of multiple-choice questions, requiring sophisticated perception and reasoning. SEED-Bench-R1 assesses generalization through a three-level hierarchy: in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios, equipped with a large-scale training dataset with easily verifiable ground-truth answers. Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, we compare RL with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), demonstrating RL's data efficiency and superior performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, even outperforming SFT on general video understanding benchmarks like LongVideoBench. Our detailed analysis reveals that RL enhances visual perception but often produces less logically coherent reasoning chains. We identify key limitations such as inconsistent reasoning and overlooked visual cues, and suggest future improvements in base model reasoning, reward modeling, and RL robustness against noisy signals.

# What, How, Where, and How Well? A Survey on Test-Time Scaling in Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Qiyuan Zhang, Fuyuan Lyu, Zexu Sun, Lei Wang, Weixu Zhang, Zhihan Guo, Yufei Wang, Irwin King, Xue Liu, Chen Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24235)  

**Abstract**: As enthusiasm for scaling computation (data and parameters) in the pretraining era gradually diminished, test-time scaling (TTS), also referred to as ``test-time computing'' has emerged as a prominent research focus. Recent studies demonstrate that TTS can further elicit the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling significant breakthroughs not only in specialized reasoning tasks, such as mathematics and coding, but also in general tasks like open-ended Q&A. However, despite the explosion of recent efforts in this area, there remains an urgent need for a comprehensive survey offering a systemic understanding. To fill this gap, we propose a unified, multidimensional framework structured along four core dimensions of TTS research: what to scale, how to scale, where to scale, and how well to scale. Building upon this taxonomy, we conduct an extensive review of methods, application scenarios, and assessment aspects, and present an organized decomposition that highlights the unique functional roles of individual techniques within the broader TTS landscape. From this analysis, we distill the major developmental trajectories of TTS to date and offer hands-on guidelines for practical deployment. Furthermore, we identify several open challenges and offer insights into promising future directions, including further scaling, clarifying the functional essence of techniques, generalizing to more tasks, and more attributions.

# Evaluating and Designing Sparse Autoencoders by Approximating Quasi-Orthogonality 

**Authors**: Sewoong Lee, Adam Davies, Marc E. Canby, Julia Hockenmaier  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24277)  

**Abstract**: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a workhorse of modern mechanistic interpretability, but leading SAE approaches with top-$k$ style activation functions lack theoretical grounding for selecting the hyperparameter $k$. SAEs are based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the representations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the superposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in the model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal definitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the latent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be approximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error bound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously unknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors, allowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which feature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given input. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA), which approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and propose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment between inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE architecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with theoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity hyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve reconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without requiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned. Our code is available at: this https URL.

# Output Constraints as Attack Surface: Exploiting Structured Generation to Bypass LLM Safety Mechanisms 

**Authors**: Shuoming Zhang, Jiacheng Zhao, Ruiyuan Xu, Xiaobing Feng, Huimin Cui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24191)  

**Abstract**: Content Warning: This paper may contain unsafe or harmful content generated by LLMs that may be offensive to readers. Large Language Models (LLMs) are extensively used as tooling platforms through structured output APIs to ensure syntax compliance so that robust integration with existing softwares like agent systems, could be achieved. However, the feature enabling functionality of grammar-guided structured output presents significant security vulnerabilities. In this work, we reveal a critical control-plane attack surface orthogonal to traditional data-plane vulnerabilities. We introduce Constrained Decoding Attack (CDA), a novel jailbreak class that weaponizes structured output constraints to bypass safety mechanisms. Unlike prior attacks focused on input prompts, CDA operates by embedding malicious intent in schema-level grammar rules (control-plane) while maintaining benign surface prompts (data-plane). We instantiate this with a proof-of-concept Chain Enum Attack, achieves 96.2% attack success rates across proprietary and open-weight LLMs on five safety benchmarks with a single query, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0-flash. Our findings identify a critical security blind spot in current LLM architectures and urge a paradigm shift in LLM safety to address control-plane vulnerabilities, as current mechanisms focused solely on data-plane threats leave critical systems exposed.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23989)  

**Abstract**: Since the disruption in LLM technology brought about by the release of GPT-3 and ChatGPT, LLMs have shown remarkable promise in programming-related tasks. While code generation remains a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains a problem with no conclusive solution. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using question-specific rubrics tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use question-agnostic rubrics. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that question-specific rubrics significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.

# Green MLOps to Green GenOps: An Empirical Study of Energy Consumption in Discriminative and Generative AI Operations 

**Authors**: Adrián Sánchez-Mompó, Ioannis Mavromatis, Peizheng Li, Konstantinos Katsaros, Aftab Khan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23934)  

**Abstract**: This study presents an empirical investigation into the energy consumption of Discriminative and Generative AI models within real-world MLOps pipelines. For Discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) are assessed, focusing primarily on energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests. Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results indicate that for Discriminative models, optimising architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon footprint reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models.

# SchemaAgent: A Multi-Agents Framework for Generating Relational Database Schema 

**Authors**: Qin Wang, Youhuan Li, Yansong Feng, Si Chen, Ziming Li, Pan Zhang, Zhichao Shi, Yuequn Dou, chuchu Gao, Zebin Huang, Zihui Si, Yixuan Chen, Zhaohai Sun, Ke Tang, Wenqiang Jin

**Abstract**: The relational database design would output a schema based on user's requirements, which defines table structures and their interrelated relations. Translating requirements into accurate schema involves several non-trivial subtasks demanding both database expertise and domain-specific knowledge. This poses unique challenges for automated design of relational databases. Existing efforts are mostly based on customized rules or conventional deep learning models, often producing suboptimal schema. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced intelligent application development across various domains. In this paper, we propose SchemaAgent, a unified LLM-based multi-agent framework for the automated generation of high-quality database schema. SchemaAgent is the first to apply LLMs for schema generation, which emulates the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to agents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective subtasks. Schema generation is a streamlined workflow, where directly applying the multi-agent framework may cause compounding impact of errors. To address this, we incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, alongside an innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify issues across various phases. For evaluation, we present a benchmark named \textit{RSchema}, which contains more than 500 pairs of requirement description and schema. Experimental results on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our approach over mainstream LLMs for relational database schema generation.

# Better wit than wealth: Dynamic Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation for Test-time Knowledge Enhancement 

**Authors**: Yuqiao Tan, Shizhu He, Huanxuan Liao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23895)  

**Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources and incorporating them into the context. While it improves reliability by providing factual texts, it significantly increases inference costs as context length grows and introduces challenging issue of RAG hallucination, primarily caused by the lack of corresponding parametric knowledge in LLMs. An efficient solution is to enhance the knowledge of LLMs at test-time. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge. DyPRAG not only reduces inference, training, and storage costs but also dynamically generates parametric knowledge, seamlessly enhancing the knowledge of LLMs and resolving knowledge conflicts in a plug-and-play manner at test-time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of DyPRAG, offering a powerful and practical RAG paradigm which enables superior knowledge fusion and mitigates RAG hallucination in real-world applications. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs 

**Authors**: Xuan Luo, Weizhi Wang, Xifeng Yan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23798)  

**Abstract**: Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration.

# OrchMLLM: Orchestrate Multimodal Data with Batch Post-Balancing to Accelerate Multimodal Large Language Model Training 

**Authors**: Yijie Zheng, Bangjun Xiao, Lei Shi, Xiaoyang Li, Faming Wu, Tianyu Li, Xuefeng Xiao, Yang Zhang, Yuxuan Wang, Shouda Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23830)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, are garnering significant attention. During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training speed and hindering further research on MLLMs.
To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data. Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an 84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.

# LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery 

**Authors**: Lu Fan, Jiashu Pu, Rongsheng Zhang, Xiao-Ming Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23740)  

**Abstract**: Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of encountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is available at this https URL.

# If an LLM Were a Character, Would It Know Its Own Story? Evaluating Lifelong Learning in LLMs 

**Authors**: Siqi Fan, Xiusheng Huang, Yiqun Yao, Xuezhi Fang, Kang Liu, Peng Han, Shuo Shang, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23514)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) can carry out human-like dialogue, but unlike humans, they are stateless due to the superposition property. However, during multi-turn, multi-agent interactions, LLMs begin to exhibit consistent, character-like behaviors, hinting at a form of emergent lifelong learning. Despite this, existing benchmarks often fail to capture these dynamics, primarily focusing on static, open-ended evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce LIFESTATE-BENCH, a benchmark designed to assess lifelong learning in LLMs. It features two episodic datasets: Hamlet and a synthetic script collection, rich in narrative structure and character interactions. Our fact checking evaluation probes models' self-awareness, episodic memory retrieval, and relationship tracking, across both parametric and non-parametric approaches. Experiments on models like Llama3.1-8B, GPT-4-turbo, and DeepSeek R1, we demonstrate that nonparametric methods significantly outperform parametric ones in managing stateful learning. However, all models exhibit challenges with catastrophic forgetting as interactions extend, highlighting the need for further advancements in lifelong learning.

# Order Independence With Finetuning 

**Authors**: Katrina Brown, Reid McIlroy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23483)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on many NLP tasks, yet often exhibit order dependence: simply reordering semantically identical tokens (e.g., answer choices in multiple-choice questions) can lead to inconsistent predictions. Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, "pulling" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs.

# Codehacks: A Dataset of Adversarial Tests for Competitive Programming Problems Obtained from Codeforces 

**Authors**: Max Hort, Leon Moonen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23466)  

**Abstract**: Software is used in critical applications in our day-to-day life and it is important to ensure its correctness. One popular approach to assess correctness is to evaluate software on tests. If a test fails, it indicates a fault in the software under test; if all tests pass correctly, one may assume that the software is correct. However, the reliability of these results depends on the test suite considered, and there is a risk of false negatives (i.e. software that passes all available tests but contains bugs because some cases are not tested). Therefore, it is important to consider error-inducing test cases when evaluating software.
To support data-driven creation of such a test-suite, which is especially of interest for testing software synthesized from large language models, we curate a dataset (Codehacks) of programming problems together with corresponding error-inducing test cases (i.e., "hacks"). This dataset is collected from the wild, in particular, from the Codeforces online judge platform. The dataset comprises 288,617 hacks for 5,578 programming problems, each with a natural language description, as well as the source code for 2,196 submitted solutions to these problems that can be broken with their corresponding hacks.
Keywords: competitive programming, language model, dataset

# An Analysis of Decoding Methods for LLM-based Agents for Faithful Multi-Hop Question Answering 

**Authors**: Alexander Murphy, Mohd Sanad Zaki Rizvi, Aden Haussmann, Ping Nie, Guifu Liu, Aryo Pradipta Gema, Pasquale Minervini  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23415)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently produce factually inaccurate outputs - a phenomenon known as hallucination - which limits their accuracy in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation and agentic frameworks such as Reasoning and Acting (ReAct) can address this issue by giving the model access to external knowledge. However, LLMs often fail to remain faithful to retrieved information. Mitigating this is critical, especially if LLMs are required to reason about the retrieved information. Recent research has explored training-free decoding strategies to improve the faithfulness of model generations. We present a systematic analysis of how the combination of the ReAct framework and decoding strategies (i.e., DeCoRe, DoLa, and CAD) can influence the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers. Our results show that combining an agentic framework for knowledge retrieval with decoding methods that enhance faithfulness can increase accuracy on the downstream Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks. For example, we observe an F1 increase from 19.5 to 32.6 on HotpotQA when using ReAct and DoLa.

# FeRG-LLM : Feature Engineering by Reason Generation Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Jeonghyun Ko, Gyeongyun Park, Donghoon Lee, Kyunam Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23371)  

**Abstract**: One of the key tasks in machine learning for tabular data is feature engineering. Although it is vital for improving the performance of models, it demands considerable human expertise and deep domain knowledge, making it labor-intensive endeavor. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, \textbf{FeRG-LLM} (\textbf{Fe}ature engineering by \textbf{R}eason \textbf{G}eneration \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{M}odels), a large language model designed to automatically perform feature engineering at an 8-billion-parameter scale. We have constructed two-stage conversational dialogues that enable language models to analyze machine learning tasks and discovering new features, exhibiting their Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities. We use these dialogues to fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B model and integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to receive feedback improving quality of new features and the model's performance. Our experiments show that FeRG-LLM performs comparably to or better than Llama 3.1 70B on most datasets, while using fewer resources and achieving reduced inference time. It outperforms other studies in classification tasks and performs well in regression tasks. Moreover, since it does not rely on cloud-hosted LLMs like GPT-4 with extra API costs when generating features, it can be deployed locally, addressing security concerns.

# SalesRLAgent: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Real-Time Sales Conversion Prediction and Optimization 

**Authors**: Nandakishor M  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23303)  

**Abstract**: Current approaches to sales conversation analysis and conversion prediction typically rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with basic retrieval augmented generation (RAG). These systems, while capable of answering questions, fail to accurately predict conversion probability or provide strategic guidance in real time. In this paper, we present SalesRLAgent, a novel framework leveraging specialized reinforcement learning to predict conversion probability throughout sales conversations. Unlike systems from this http URL, Mendable, Inkeep, and others that primarily use off-the-shelf LLMs for content generation, our approach treats conversion prediction as a sequential decision problem, training on synthetic data generated using GPT-4O to develop a specialized probability estimation model. Our system incorporates Azure OpenAI embeddings (3072 dimensions), turn-by-turn state tracking, and meta-learning capabilities to understand its own knowledge boundaries. Evaluations demonstrate that SalesRLAgent achieves 96.7% accuracy in conversion prediction, outperforming LLM-only approaches by 34.7% while offering significantly faster inference (85ms vs 3450ms for GPT-4). Furthermore, integration with existing sales platforms shows a 43.2% increase in conversion rates when representatives utilize our system's real-time guidance. SalesRLAgent represents a fundamental shift from content generation to strategic sales intelligence, providing moment-by-moment conversion probability estimation with actionable insights for sales professionals.

# Extracting Patient History from Clinical Text: A Comparative Study of Clinical Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Hieu Nghiem, Tuan-Dung Le, Suhao Chen, Thanh Thieu, Andrew Gin, Ellie Phuong Nguyen, Dursun Delen, Johnson Thomas, Jivan Lamichhane, Zhuqi Miao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23281)  

**Abstract**: Extracting medical history entities (MHEs) related to a patient's chief complaint (CC), history of present illness (HPI), and past, family, and social history (PFSH) helps structure free-text clinical notes into standardized EHRs, streamlining downstream tasks like continuity of care, medical coding, and quality metrics. Fine-tuned clinical large language models (cLLMs) can assist in this process while ensuring the protection of sensitive data via on-premises deployment. This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing CC/HPI/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model accuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes from the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven state-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when enhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical entities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics affecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note length, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing the time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many types of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the frequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and GatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest performance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model performance for certain entities. Regarding the impact of textual characteristics on model performance, we found that longer entities were harder to identify, note length did not correlate with a higher error rate, and well-organized segments with headings are beneficial for the extraction.

# Encrypted Prompt: Securing LLM Applications Against Unauthorized Actions 

**Authors**: Shih-Han Chan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23250)  

**Abstract**: Security threats like prompt injection attacks pose significant risks to applications that integrate Large Language Models (LLMs), potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as API misuse. Unlike previous approaches that aim to detect these attacks on a best-effort basis, this paper introduces a novel method that appends an Encrypted Prompt to each user prompt, embedding current permissions. These permissions are verified before executing any actions (such as API calls) generated by the LLM. If the permissions are insufficient, the LLM's actions will not be executed, ensuring safety. This approach guarantees that only actions within the scope of the current permissions from the LLM can proceed. In scenarios where adversarial prompts are introduced to mislead the LLM, this method ensures that any unauthorized actions from LLM wouldn't be executed by verifying permissions in Encrypted Prompt. Thus, threats like prompt injection attacks that trigger LLM to generate harmful actions can be effectively mitigated.

# Evaluating how LLM annotations represent diverse views on contentious topics 

**Authors**: Megan A. Brown, Shubham Atreja, Libby Hemphill, Patrick Y. Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23243)  

**Abstract**: Researchers have proposed the use of generative large language models (LLMs) to label data for both research and applied settings. This literature emphasizes the improved performance of LLMs relative to other natural language models, noting that LLMs typically outperform other models on standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. However, previous literature has also highlighted the bias embedded in language models, particularly around contentious topics such as potentially toxic content. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Instead, the model, prompt, and disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task are far more predictive of LLM agreement. Our findings suggest that when using LLMs to annotate data, under-representing the views of particular groups is not a substantial concern. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for researchers and practitioners.

# CCCI: Code Completion with Contextual Information for Complex Data Transfer Tasks Using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Hangzhan Jin, Mohammad Hamdaqa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23231)  

**Abstract**: Unlike code generation, which involves creating code from scratch, code completion focuses on integrating new lines or blocks of code into an existing codebase. This process requires a deep understanding of the surrounding context, such as variable scope, object models, API calls, and database relations, to produce accurate results. These complex contextual dependencies make code completion a particularly challenging problem. Current models and approaches often fail to effectively incorporate such context, leading to inaccurate completions with low acceptance rates (around 30\%). For tasks like data transfer, which rely heavily on specific relationships and data structures, acceptance rates drop even further. This study introduces CCCI, a novel method for generating context-aware code completions specifically designed to address data transfer tasks. By integrating contextual information, such as database table relationships, object models, and library details into Large Language Models (LLMs), CCCI improves the accuracy of code completions. We evaluate CCCI using 289 Java snippets, extracted from over 819 operational scripts in an industrial setting. The results demonstrate that CCCI achieved a 49.1\% Build Pass rate and a 41.0\% CodeBLEU score, comparable to state-of-the-art methods that often struggle with complex task completion.

# Aurelia: Test-time Reasoning Distillation in Audio-Visual LLMs 

**Authors**: Sanjoy Chowdhury, Hanan Gani, Nishit Anand, Sayan Nag, Ruohan Gao, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Salman Khan, Dinesh Manocha  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23219)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in reasoning optimization have greatly enhanced the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, existing work fails to address the complexities of audio-visual scenarios, underscoring the need for further research. In this paper, we introduce AURELIA, a novel actor-critic based audio-visual (AV) reasoning framework that distills structured, step-by-step reasoning into AVLLMs at test time, improving their ability to process complex multi-modal inputs without additional training or fine-tuning. To further advance AVLLM reasoning skills, we present AVReasonBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 4500 audio-visual questions, each paired with detailed step-by-step reasoning. Our benchmark spans six distinct tasks, including AV-GeoIQ, which evaluates AV reasoning combined with geographical and cultural knowledge. Evaluating 18 AVLLMs on AVReasonBench reveals significant limitations in their multi-modal reasoning capabilities. Using AURELIA, we achieve up to a 100% relative improvement, demonstrating its effectiveness. This performance gain highlights the potential of reasoning-enhanced data generation for advancing AVLLMs in real-world applications. Our code and data will be publicly released at: https: //github.com/schowdhury671/aurelia.

# Large Language Models are Unreliable for Cyber Threat Intelligence 

**Authors**: Emanuele Mezzi, Fabio Massacci, Katja Tuma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23175)  

**Abstract**: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

# RECALL-MM: A Multimodal Dataset of Consumer Product Recalls for Risk Analysis using Computational Methods and Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Diana Bolanos, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Daniele Grandi, Kosa Goucher-Lambert  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23213)  

**Abstract**: Product recalls provide valuable insights into potential risks and hazards within the engineering design process, yet their full potential remains underutilized. In this study, we curate data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls database to develop a multimodal dataset, RECALL-MM, that informs data-driven risk assessment using historical information, and augment it using generative methods. Patterns in the dataset highlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant impact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps that embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions and product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case studies to demonstrate the dataset's utility in identifying product risks and guiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how designers can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new product ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate hazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large language model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product images. This demonstrates the model's ability to leverage visual context to identify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data across many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas where hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of risk awareness throughout the design process. Collectively, this work aims to bridge the gap between historical recall data and future product safety, presenting a scalable, data-driven approach to safer engineering design.

# Reasoning-SQL: Reinforcement Learning with SQL Tailored Partial Rewards for Reasoning-Enhanced Text-to-SQL 

**Authors**: Mohammadreza Pourreza, Shayan Talaei, Ruoxi Sun, Xingchen Wan, Hailong Li, Azalia Mirhoseini, Amin Saberi, Sercan "O. Arik  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23157)  

**Abstract**: Text-to-SQL is a challenging task involving multiple reasoning-intensive subtasks, including natural language understanding, database schema comprehension, and precise SQL query formulation. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted reasoning paths with inductive biases that can limit their overall effectiveness. Motivated by the recent success of reasoning-enhanced models such as DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o1, which effectively leverage reward-driven self-exploration to enhance reasoning capabilities and generalization, we propose a novel set of partial rewards tailored specifically for the Text-to-SQL task. Our reward set includes schema-linking, AI feedback, n-gram similarity, and syntax check, explicitly designed to address the reward sparsity issue prevalent in reinforcement learning (RL). Leveraging group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly encourages large language models (LLMs) to develop intrinsic reasoning skills necessary for accurate SQL query generation. With models of different sizes, we demonstrate that RL-only training with our proposed rewards consistently achieves higher accuracy and superior generalization compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Remarkably, our RL-trained 14B-parameter model significantly outperforms larger proprietary models, e.g. o3-mini by 4% and Gemini-1.5-Pro-002 by 3% on the BIRD benchmark. These highlight the efficacy of our proposed RL-training framework with partial rewards for enhancing both accuracy and reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL tasks.

# CodeARC: Benchmarking Reasoning Capabilities of LLM Agents for Inductive Program Synthesis 

**Authors**: Anjiang Wei, Tarun Suresh, Jiannan Cao, Naveen Kannan, Yuheng Wu, Kai Yan, Thiago S. F. X. Teixeira, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23145)  

**Abstract**: Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.

# The Reasoning-Memorization Interplay in Language Models Is Mediated by a Single Direction 

**Authors**: Yihuai Hong, Dian Zhou, Meng Cao, Lei Yu, Zhijing Jin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23084)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) excel on a variety of reasoning benchmarks, but previous studies suggest they sometimes struggle to generalize to unseen questions, potentially due to over-reliance on memorized training examples. However, the precise conditions under which LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization during text generation remain unclear. In this work, we provide a mechanistic understanding of LLMs' reasoning-memorization dynamics by identifying a set of linear features in the model's residual stream that govern the balance between genuine reasoning and memory recall. These features not only distinguish reasoning tasks from memory-intensive ones but can also be manipulated to causally influence model performance on reasoning tasks. Additionally, we show that intervening in these reasoning features helps the model more accurately activate the most relevant problem-solving capabilities during answer generation. Our findings offer new insights into the underlying mechanisms of reasoning and memory in LLMs and pave the way for the development of more robust and interpretable generative AI systems.

**Abstract**: Cross-lingual open-ended generation -- i.e. generating responses in a desired language different from that of the user's query -- is an important yet understudied problem. We introduce XL-AlpacaEval, a new benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual generation capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), and propose XL-Instruct, a high-quality synthetic data generation method. Fine-tuning with just 8K XL-Instruct-generated instructions significantly improves model performance, increasing the win rate against GPT-4o-Mini from 7.4% to 21.5%, and improving on several fine-grained quality metrics. Additionally, models fine-tuned on XL-Instruct exhibit strong zero-shot transfer to both English-only and multilingual generation tasks. Given its consistent gains across the board, we strongly recommend incorporating XL-Instruct in the post-training pipeline of future multilingual LLMs. To facilitate further research, we will publicly and freely release the XL-Instruct and XL-AlpacaEval datasets, which constitute two of the few cross-lingual resources currently available in the literature.

**Authors**: Hanwool Lee, Soo Yong Kim, Dasol Choi, SangWon Baek, Seunghyeok Hong, Ilgyun Jeong, Inseon Hwang, Naeun Lee, Guijin Son  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22968)  

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in Korean large language models (LLMs) have spurred numerous benchmarks and evaluation methodologies, yet the lack of a standardized evaluation framework has led to inconsistent results and limited comparability. To address this, we introduce HRET Haerae Evaluation Toolkit, an open-source, self-evolving evaluation framework tailored specifically for Korean LLMs. HRET unifies diverse evaluation methods, including logit-based scoring, exact-match, language-inconsistency penalization, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments. Its modular, registry-based architecture integrates major benchmarks (HAE-RAE Bench, KMMLU, KUDGE, HRM8K) and multiple inference backends (vLLM, HuggingFace, OpenAI-compatible endpoints). With automated pipelines for continuous evolution, HRET provides a robust foundation for reproducible, fair, and transparent Korean NLP research.

# Can LLMs Support Medical Knowledge Imputation? An Evaluation-Based Perspective 

**Authors**: Xinyu Yao, Aditya Sannabhadti, Holly Wiberg, Karmel S. Shehadeh, Rema Padman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22954)  

**Abstract**: Medical knowledge graphs (KGs) are essential for clinical decision support and biomedical research, yet they often exhibit incompleteness due to knowledge gaps and structural limitations in medical coding systems. This issue is particularly evident in treatment mapping, where coding systems such as ICD, Mondo, and ATC lack comprehensive coverage, resulting in missing or inconsistent associations between diseases and their potential treatments. To address this issue, we have explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for imputing missing treatment relationships. Although LLMs offer promising capabilities in knowledge augmentation, their application in medical knowledge imputation presents significant risks, including factual inaccuracies, hallucinated associations, and instability between and within LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate LLM-driven treatment mapping, assessing its reliability through benchmark comparisons. Our findings highlight critical limitations, including inconsistencies with established clinical guidelines and potential risks to patient safety. This study serves as a cautionary guide for researchers and practitioners, underscoring the importance of critical evaluation and hybrid approaches when leveraging LLMs to enhance treatment mappings on medical knowledge graphs.

# SUV: Scalable Large Language Model Copyright Compliance with Regularized Selective Unlearning 

**Authors**: Tianyang Xu, Xiaoze Liu, Feijie Wu, Xiaoqian Wang, Jing Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22948)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing by learning from massive datasets, yet this rapid progress has also drawn legal scrutiny, as the ability to unintentionally generate copyrighted content has already prompted several prominent lawsuits. In this work, we introduce SUV (Selective Unlearning for Verbatim data), a selective unlearning framework designed to prevent LLM from memorizing copyrighted content while preserving its overall utility. In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications.

# Understanding Inequality of LLM Fact-Checking over Geographic Regions with Agent and Retrieval models 

**Authors**: Bruno Coelho, Shujaat Mirza, Yuyuan Cui, Christina Pöpper, Damon McCoy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22877)  

**Abstract**: Fact-checking is a potentially useful application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat the growing dissemination of disinformation. However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.
Using a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.

# Teaching LLMs Music Theory with In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Pedagogical Strategies for Machines 

**Authors**: Liam Pond, Ichiro Fujinaga  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22853)  

**Abstract**: This study evaluates the baseline capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to learn concepts in music theory through in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting. Using carefully designed prompts (in-context learning) and step-by-step worked examples (chain-of-thought prompting), we explore how LLMs can be taught increasingly complex material and how pedagogical strategies for human learners translate to educating machines. Performance is evaluated using questions from an official Canadian Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) Level 6 examination, which covers a comprehensive range of topics, including interval and chord identification, key detection, cadence classification, and metrical analysis. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of various music encoding formats for these tasks (ABC, Humdrum, MEI, MusicXML). All experiments were run both with and without contextual prompts. Results indicate that without context, ChatGPT with MEI performs the best at 52%, while with context, Claude with MEI performs the best at 75%. Future work will further refine prompts and expand to cover more advanced music theory concepts. This research contributes to the broader understanding of teaching LLMs and has applications for educators, students, and developers of AI music tools alike.

# RobuNFR: Evaluating the Robustness of Large Language Models on Non-Functional Requirements Aware Code Generation 

**Authors**: Feng Lin, Dong Jae Kim, Zhenhao Li, Jinqiu Yang, Tse-Husn, Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22851)  

**Abstract**: When using LLMs to address Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs), developers may behave differently (e.g., expressing the same NFR in different words). Robust LLMs should output consistent results across these variations; however, this aspect remains underexplored. We propose RobuNFR for evaluating the robustness of LLMs in NFR-aware code generation across four NFR dimensions: design, readability, reliability, and performance, using three methodologies: prompt variation, regression testing, and diverse workflows. Our experiments show that RobuNFR reveals robustness issues in the tested LLMs when considering NFRs in code generation. Specifically, under prompt variation, including NFRs leads to a decrease in Pass@1 by up to 39 percent and an increase in the standard deviation from 0.48 to 2.48 compared to the baseline without NFRs (i.e., Function-Only). While incorporating NFRs generally improves overall NFR metrics, it also results in higher prompt sensitivity. In regression settings, some LLMs exhibit differences across versions, with improvements in one aspect (e.g., reduced code smells) often accompanied by regressions in another (e.g., decreased correctness), revealing inconsistencies that challenge their robustness. When varying workflows, the tested LLMs show significantly different NFR-aware code generation capabilities between two workflows: (1) integrating NFRs and functional requirements into the initial prompt and (2) enhancing Function-Only-generated code with the same NFR.

# Post-Incorporating Code Structural Knowledge into LLMs via In-Context Learning for Code Translation 

**Authors**: Yali Du, Hui Sun, Ming Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22776)  

**Abstract**: Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.

# Data Poisoning in Deep Learning: A Survey 

**Authors**: Pinlong Zhao, Weiyao Zhu, Pengfei Jiao, Di Gao, Ou Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22759)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning has become a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, enabling transformative applications across a wide range of domains. As the core element of deep learning, the quality and security of training data critically influence model performance and reliability. However, during the training process, deep learning models face the significant threat of data poisoning, where attackers introduce maliciously manipulated training data to degrade model accuracy or lead to anomalous behavior. While existing surveys provide valuable insights into data poisoning, they generally adopt a broad perspective, encompassing both attacks and defenses, but lack a dedicated, in-depth analysis of poisoning attacks specifically in deep learning. In this survey, we bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive and targeted review of data poisoning in deep learning. First, this survey categorizes data poisoning attacks across multiple perspectives, providing an in-depth analysis of their characteristics and underlying design princinples. Second, the discussion is extended to the emerging area of data poisoning in large language models(LLMs). Finally, we explore critical open challenges in the field and propose potential research directions to advance the field further. To support further exploration, an up-to-date repository of resources on data poisoning in deep learning is available at this https URL.

# Adaptive Interactive Navigation of Quadruped Robots using Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Kangjie Zhou, Yao Mu, Haoyang Song, Yi Zeng, Pengying Wu, Han Gao, Chang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22942)  

**Abstract**: Robotic navigation in complex environments remains a critical research challenge. Traditional navigation methods focus on optimal trajectory generation within free space, struggling in environments lacking viable paths to the goal, such as disaster zones or cluttered warehouses. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive interactive navigation approach that proactively interacts with environments to create feasible paths to reach originally unavailable goals. Specifically, we present a primitive tree for task planning with large language models (LLMs), facilitating effective reasoning to determine interaction objects and sequences. To ensure robust subtask execution, we adopt reinforcement learning to pre-train a comprehensive skill library containing versatile locomotion and interaction behaviors for motion planning. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive replanning method featuring two LLM-based modules: an advisor serving as a flexible replanning trigger and an arborist for autonomous plan adjustment. Integrated with the tree structure, the replanning mechanism allows for convenient node addition and pruning, enabling rapid plan modification in unknown environments. Comprehensive simulations and experiments have demonstrated our method's effectiveness and adaptivity in diverse scenarios. The supplementary video is available at page: this https URL.

# Ignite Forecasting with SPARK: An Efficient Generative Framework for Refining LLMs in Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting 

**Authors**: Gongzhu Yin, Hongli Zhang, Yi Luo, Yuchen Yang, Kun Lu, Chao Meng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22748)  

**Abstract**: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) forecasting is crucial for predicting future events using historical data. With the surge of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have begun exploring their integration into TKG forecasting and achieved some success. However, they still face limitations such as limited input length, inefficient output generation, and resource-intensive refinement, which undermine their performance and practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce SPARK, a Sequence-level Proxy-Adapting framework for Refining LLMs in TKG forecasting. Inspired by inference-time algorithms adopted in controlling generation, SPARK offers a cost-effective, plug-and-play solution through two key innovations: (1) Beam Sequence-Level Generation, which reframes TKG forecasting as a top-K sequence-level generation task, using beam search for efficiently generating next-entity distribution in a single forward pass. (2) TKG Adapter for Refinement, which employs traditional TKG models as trainable proxy adapters to leverage global graph information and refine LLM outputs, overcoming both the input length and the resource-intensive fine-tuning problems. Experiments across diverse datasets validate SPARK's forecasting performance, robust generalization capabilities, and high efficiency. We release source codes at this https URL.

# Susceptibility of Large Language Models to User-Driven Factors in Medical Queries 

**Authors**: Kyung Ho Lim, Ujin Kang, Xiang Li, Jin Sung Kim, Young-Chul Jung, Sangjoon Park, Byung-Hoon Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22746)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in healthcare, but their reliability is heavily influenced by user-driven factors such as question phrasing and the completeness of clinical information. In this study, we examined how misinformation framing, source authority, model persona, and omission of key clinical details affect the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs. We conducted two experiments: one introducing misleading external opinions with varying assertiveness (perturbation test), and another removing specific categories of patient information (ablation test). Using public datasets (MedQA and Medbullets), we evaluated proprietary models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash) and open-source models (LLaMA 3 8B, LLaMA 3 Med42 8B, DeepSeek R1 8B). All models were vulnerable to user-driven misinformation, with proprietary models especially affected by definitive and authoritative language. Assertive tone had the greatest negative impact on accuracy. In the ablation test, omitting physical exam findings and lab results caused the most significant performance drop. Although proprietary models had higher baseline accuracy, their performance declined sharply under misinformation. These results highlight the need for well-structured prompts and complete clinical context. Users should avoid authoritative framing of misinformation and provide full clinical details, especially for complex cases.

# Boosting Large Language Models with Mask Fine-Tuning 

**Authors**: Mingyuan Zhang, Yue Bai, Huan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Qihua Dong, Yun Fu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22764)  

**Abstract**: The model is usually kept integral in the mainstream large language model (LLM) fine-tuning protocols. No works have questioned whether maintaining the integrity of the model is indispensable for performance. In this work, we introduce Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT), a brand-new LLM fine-tuning paradigm to show that properly breaking the integrity of the model can surprisingly lead to improved performance. Specifically, MFT learns a set of binary masks supervised by the typical LLM fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments show that MFT gains a consistent performance boost across various domains and backbones (e.g., 1.95%/1.88% average gain in coding with LLaMA2-7B/3.1-8B). Detailed procedures are provided to study the proposed MFT from different hyperparameter perspectives for better insight. In particular, MFT naturally updates the current LLM training protocol by deploying it on a complete well-trained model. This study extends the functionality of mask learning from its conventional network pruning context for model compression to a more general scope.

**Authors**: Amr Alshatnawi, Remi Sampaleanu, David Liebovitz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22769)  

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been advancing rapidly and with the advent of large language models (LLMs) in late 2022, numerous opportunities have emerged for adopting this technology across various domains, including medicine. These innovations hold immense potential to revolutionize and modernize medical education. Our research project leverages large language models to enhance medical education and address workflow challenges through the development of MediTools - AI Medical Education. This prototype application focuses on developing interactive tools that simulate real-life clinical scenarios, provide access to medical literature, and keep users updated with the latest medical news. Our first tool is a dermatology case simulation tool that uses real patient images depicting various dermatological conditions and enables interaction with LLMs acting as virtual patients. This platform allows users to practice their diagnostic skills and enhance their clinical decision-making abilities. The application also features two additional tools: an AI-enhanced PubMed tool for engaging with LLMs to gain deeper insights into research papers, and a Google News tool that offers LLM generated summaries of articles for various medical specialties. A comprehensive survey has been conducted among medical professionals and students to gather initial feedback on the effectiveness and user satisfaction of MediTools, providing insights for further development and refinement of the application. This research demonstrates the potential of AI-driven tools in transforming and revolutionizing medical education, offering a scalable and interactive platform for continuous learning and skill development.

# Why Representation Engineering Works: A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Bowei Tian, Xuntao Lyu, Meng Liu, Hongyi Wang, Ang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22720)  

**Abstract**: Representation Engineering (RepE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI transparency by focusing on high-level representations rather than individual neurons or circuits. It has proven effective in improving interpretability and control, showing that representations can emerge, propagate, and shape final model outputs in large language models (LLMs). However, in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), visual input can override factual linguistic knowledge, leading to hallucinated responses that contradict reality. To address this challenge, we make the first attempt to extend RepE to VLMs, analyzing how multimodal representations are preserved and transformed. Building on our findings and drawing inspiration from successful RepE applications, we develop a theoretical framework that explains the stability of neural activity across layers using the principal eigenvector, uncovering the underlying mechanism of RepE. We empirically validate these instrinsic properties, demonstrating their broad applicability and significance. By bridging theoretical insights with empirical validation, this work transforms RepE from a descriptive tool into a structured theoretical framework, opening new directions for improving AI robustness, fairness, and transparency.

# Zero-Shot LLMs in Human-in-the-Loop RL: Replacing Human Feedback for Reward Shaping 

**Authors**: Mohammad Saif Nazir, Chayan Banerjee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22723)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning often faces challenges with reward misalignment, where agents optimize for given rewards but fail to exhibit the desired behaviors. This occurs when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors that diverge from the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HIL) methods can help, they may exacerbate the problem, as humans are prone to biases that lead to inconsistent, subjective, or misaligned feedback, complicating the learning process. To address these issues, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. By leveraging LLMs as direct feedback providers, we replace surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often suffer from the bias inherent in the feedback data it is trained on. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human guidance. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with average episodic reward (AER) dropping from 28.472 in (unbiased approaches) to 7.039 (biased with conservative bias). In contrast, LLM-based approaches maintain a matching AER like unbiased feedback, even in custom edge case scenarios.

# Rec-R1: Bridging Generative Large Language Models and User-Centric Recommendation Systems via Reinforcement Learning 

**Authors**: Jiacheng Lin, Tian Wang, Kun Qian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24289)  

**Abstract**: We propose Rec-R1, a general reinforcement learning framework that bridges large language models (LLMs) with recommendation systems through closed-loop optimization. Unlike prompting and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Rec-R1 directly optimizes LLM generation using feedback from a fixed black-box recommendation model, without relying on synthetic SFT data from proprietary models such as GPT-4o. This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.

# DAT: Dynamic Alpha Tuning for Hybrid Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Hsin-Ling Hsu, Jengnan Tzeng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23013)  

**Abstract**: Hybrid retrieval techniques in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance information retrieval by combining dense and sparse (e.g., BM25-based) retrieval methods. However, existing approaches struggle with adaptability, as fixed weighting schemes fail to adjust to different queries. To address this, we propose DAT (Dynamic Alpha Tuning), a novel hybrid retrieval framework that dynamically balances dense retrieval and BM25 for each query. DAT leverages a large language model (LLM) to evaluate the effectiveness of the top-1 results from both retrieval methods, assigning an effectiveness score to each. It then calibrates the optimal weighting factor through effectiveness score normalization, ensuring a more adaptive and query-aware weighting between the two approaches. Empirical results show that DAT consistently significantly outperforms fixed-weighting hybrid retrieval methods across various evaluation metrics. Even on smaller models, DAT delivers strong performance, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability.

# Text2Tracks: Prompt-based Music Recommendation via Generative Retrieval 

**Authors**: Enrico Palumbo, Gustavo Penha, Andreas Damianou, José Luis Redondo García, Timothy Christopher Heath, Alice Wang, Hugues Bouchard, Mounia Lalmas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24193)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled users to provide highly specific music recommendation requests using natural language prompts (e.g. "Can you recommend some old classics for slow dancing?"). In this setup, the recommended tracks are predicted by the LLM in an autoregressive way, i.e. the LLM generates the track titles one token at a time. While intuitive, this approach has several limitation. First, it is based on a general purpose tokenization that is optimized for words rather than for track titles. Second, it necessitates an additional entity resolution layer that matches the track title to the actual track identifier. Third, the number of decoding steps scales linearly with the length of the track title, slowing down inference. In this paper, we propose to address the task of prompt-based music recommendation as a generative retrieval task. Within this setting, we introduce novel, effective, and efficient representations of track identifiers that significantly outperform commonly used strategies. We introduce Text2Tracks, a generative retrieval model that learns a mapping from a user's music recommendation prompt to the relevant track IDs directly. Through an offline evaluation on a dataset of playlists with language inputs, we find that (1) the strategy to create IDs for music tracks is the most important factor for the effectiveness of Text2Tracks and semantic IDs significantly outperform commonly used strategies that rely on song titles as identifiers (2) provided with the right choice of track identifiers, Text2Tracks outperforms sparse and dense retrieval solutions trained to retrieve tracks from language prompts.

# CoRanking: Collaborative Ranking with Small and Large Ranking Agents 

**Authors**: Wenhan Liu, Xinyu Ma, Yutao Zhu, Lixin Su, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Zhicheng Dou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23427)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior listwise ranking performance. However, their superior performance often relies on large-scale parameters (\eg, GPT-4) and a repetitive sliding window process, which introduces significant efficiency challenges. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoRanking}, a novel collaborative ranking framework that combines small and large ranking models for efficient and effective ranking. CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker.

# Imagine All The Relevance: Scenario-Profiled Indexing with Knowledge Expansion for Dense Retrieval 

**Authors**: Sangam Lee, Ryang Heo, SeongKu Kang, Dongha Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23033)  

**Abstract**: Existing dense retrieval models struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval task as they fail to capture implicit relevance that requires reasoning beyond surface-level semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose Scenario-Profiled Indexing with Knowledge Expansion (SPIKE), a dense retrieval framework that explicitly indexes implicit relevance by decomposing documents into scenario-based retrieval units. SPIKE organizes documents into scenario, which encapsulates the reasoning process necessary to uncover implicit relationships between hypothetical information needs and document content. SPIKE constructs a scenario-augmented dataset using a powerful teacher large language model (LLM), then distills these reasoning capabilities into a smaller, efficient scenario generator. During inference, SPIKE incorporates scenario-level relevance alongside document-level relevance, enabling reasoning-aware retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPIKE consistently enhances retrieval performance across various query types and dense retrievers. It also enhances the retrieval experience for users through scenario and offers valuable contextual information for LLMs in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

# Enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for Telecommunications using Knowledge Graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation 

**Authors**: Dun Yuan, Hao Zhou, Di Wu, Xue Liu, Hao Chen, Yan Xin, Jianzhong, Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24245)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in general-purpose natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs are still facing challenges when applied to domain-specific areas like telecommunications, which demands specialized expertise and adaptability to evolving standards. This paper presents a novel framework that combines knowledge graph (KG) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to enhance LLM performance in the telecom domain. The framework leverages a KG to capture structured, domain-specific information about network protocols, standards, and other telecom-related entities, comprehensively representing their relationships. By integrating KG with RAG, LLMs can dynamically access and utilize the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge during response generation. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between structured knowledge representation and the generative capabilities of LLMs, significantly enhancing accuracy, adaptability, and domain-specific comprehension. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the KG-RAG framework in addressing complex technical queries with precision. The proposed KG-RAG model attained an accuracy of 88% for question answering tasks on a frequently used telecom-specific dataset, compared to 82% for the RAG-only and 48% for the LLM-only approaches.

# TwT: Thinking without Tokens by Habitual Reasoning Distillation with Multi-Teachers' Guidance 

**Authors**: Jingxian Xu, Mengyu Zhou, Weichang Liu, Hanbing Liu, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24198)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in problem-solving by incorporating reasoning processes. However, this enhanced reasoning capability results in an increased number of output tokens during inference, leading to higher computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose TwT (Thinking without Tokens), a method that reduces inference-time costs through habitual reasoning distillation with multi-teachers' guidance, while maintaining high performance. Our approach introduces a Habitual Reasoning Distillation method, which internalizes explicit reasoning into the model's habitual behavior through a Teacher-Guided compression strategy inspired by human cognition. Additionally, we propose Dual-Criteria Rejection Sampling (DCRS), a technique that generates a high-quality and diverse distillation dataset using multiple teacher models, making our method suitable for unsupervised scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that TwT effectively reduces inference costs while preserving superior performance, achieving up to a 13.6% improvement in accuracy with fewer output tokens compared to other distillation methods, offering a highly practical solution for efficient LLM deployment.

# Is LLM the Silver Bullet to Low-Resource Languages Machine Translation? 

**Authors**: Yewei Song, Lujun Li, Cedric Lothritz, Saad Ezzini, Lama Sleem, Niccolo Gentile, Radu State, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Jacques Klein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24102)  

**Abstract**: Low-Resource Languages (LRLs) present significant challenges in natural language processing due to their limited linguistic resources and underrepresentation in standard datasets. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Neural Machine Translation (NMT) have substantially improved translation capabilities for high-resource languages, performance disparities persist for LRLs, particularly impacting privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. This paper systematically evaluates the limitations of current LLMs across 200 languages using benchmarks such as FLORES-200. We also explore alternative data sources, including news articles and bilingual dictionaries, and demonstrate how knowledge distillation from large pre-trained models can significantly improve smaller LRL translations. Additionally, we investigate various fine-tuning strategies, revealing that incremental enhancements markedly reduce performance gaps on smaller LLMs.

# Artificial Conversations, Real Results: Fostering Language Detection with Synthetic Data 

**Authors**: Fatemeh Mohammadi, Tommaso Romano, Samira Maghool, Paolo Ceravolo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24062)  

**Abstract**: Collecting high-quality training data is essential for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). However, acquiring such data is often costly and time-consuming, especially for non-English languages such as Italian. Recently, researchers have begun to explore the use of LLMs to generate synthetic datasets as a viable alternative. This study proposes a pipeline for generating synthetic data and a comprehensive approach for investigating the factors that influence the validity of synthetic data generated by LLMs by examining how model performance is affected by metrics such as prompt strategy, text length and target position in a specific task, i.e. inclusive language detection in Italian job advertisements. Our results show that, in most cases and across different metrics, the fine-tuned models trained on synthetic data consistently outperformed other models on both real and synthetic test datasets. The study discusses the practical implications and limitations of using synthetic data for language detection tasks with LLMs.

# Is analogy enough to draw novel adjective-noun inferences? 

**Authors**: Hayley Ross, Kathryn Davidson, Najoung Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24293)  

**Abstract**: Recent work (Ross et al., 2025, 2024) has argued that the ability of humans and LLMs respectively to generalize to novel adjective-noun combinations shows that they each have access to a compositional mechanism to determine the phrase's meaning and derive inferences. We study whether these inferences can instead be derived by analogy to known inferences, without need for composition. We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical reasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human participants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well for a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al. (2025), there are novel combinations for which both humans and LLMs derive convergent inferences but which are not well handled by analogy. We thus conclude that the mechanism humans and LLMs use to generalize in these cases cannot be fully reduced to analogy, and likely involves composition.

# Model Hemorrhage and the Robustness Limits of Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Ziyang Ma, Zuchao Li, Lefei Zhang, Gui-Song Xia, Bo Du, Liangpei Zhang, Dacheng Tao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23924)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across natural language processing tasks, yet undergo significant performance degradation when modified for deployment through quantization, pruning, or decoding strategy adjustments. We define this phenomenon as model hemorrhage - performance decline caused by parameter alterations and architectural changes. Through systematic analysis of various LLM frameworks, we identify key vulnerability patterns: layer expansion frequently disrupts attention mechanisms, compression techniques induce information loss cascades, and decoding adjustments amplify prediction divergences. Our investigation reveals transformer architectures exhibit inherent robustness thresholds that determine hemorrhage severity across modification types. We propose three mitigation strategies: gradient-aware pruning preserves critical weight pathways, dynamic quantization scaling maintains activation integrity, and decoding calibration aligns generation trajectories with original model distributions. This work establishes foundational metrics for evaluating model stability during adaptation, providing practical guidelines for maintaining performance while enabling efficient LLM deployment. Our findings advance understanding of neural network resilience under architectural transformations, particularly for large-scale language models.

# Rubrik's Cube: Testing a New Rubric for Evaluating Explanations on the CUBE dataset 

**Authors**: Diana Galvan-Sosa, Gabrielle Gaudeau, Pride Kavumba, Yunmeng Li, Hongyi gu, Zheng Yuan, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Paula Buttery  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23899)  

**Abstract**: The performance and usability of Large-Language Models (LLMs) are driving their use in explanation generation tasks. However, despite their widespread adoption, LLM explanations have been found to be unreliable, making it difficult for users to distinguish good from bad explanations. To address this issue, we present Rubrik's CUBE, an education-inspired rubric and a dataset of 26k explanations, written and later quality-annotated using the rubric by both humans and six open- and closed-source LLMs. The CUBE dataset focuses on two reasoning and two language tasks, providing the necessary diversity for us to effectively test our proposed rubric. Using Rubrik, we find that explanations are influenced by both task and perceived difficulty. Low quality stems primarily from a lack of conciseness in LLM-generated explanations, rather than cohesion and word choice. The full dataset, rubric, and code will be made available upon acceptance.

# Synthetic News Generation for Fake News Classification 

**Authors**: Abdul Sittar, Luka Golob, Mateja Smiljanic  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24206)  

**Abstract**: This study explores the generation and evaluation of synthetic fake news through fact based manipulations using large language models (LLMs). We introduce a novel methodology that extracts key facts from real articles, modifies them, and regenerates content to simulate fake news while maintaining coherence. To assess the quality of the generated content, we propose a set of evaluation metrics coherence, dissimilarity, and correctness. The research also investigates the application of synthetic data in fake news classification, comparing traditional machine learning models with transformer based models such as BERT. Our experiments demonstrate that transformer models, especially BERT, effectively leverage synthetic data for fake news detection, showing improvements with smaller proportions of synthetic data. Additionally, we find that fact verification features, which focus on identifying factual inconsistencies, provide the most promising results in distinguishing synthetic fake news. The study highlights the potential of synthetic data to enhance fake news detection systems, offering valuable insights for future research and suggesting that targeted improvements in synthetic data generation can further strengthen detection models.

**Authors**: Zhiming Ma, Peidong Wang, Minhua Huang, Jingpeng Wang, Kai Wu, Xiangzhao Lv, Yachun Pang, Yin Yang, Wenjie Tang, Yuchen Kang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24115)  

**Abstract**: The detection of telecom fraud faces significant challenges due to the lack of high-quality multimodal training data that integrates audio signals with reasoning-oriented textual analysis. To address this gap, we present TeleAntiFraud-28k, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset specifically designed for automated telecom fraud analysis. Our dataset is constructed through three strategies: (1) Privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation using automatically speech recognition (ASR)-transcribed call recordings (with anonymized original audio), ensuring real-world consistency through text-to-speech (TTS) model regeneration; (2) Semantic enhancement via large language model (LLM)-based self-instruction sampling on authentic ASR outputs to expand scenario coverage; (3) Multi-agent adversarial synthesis that simulates emerging fraud tactics through predefined communication scenarios and fraud typologies. The generated dataset contains 28,511 rigorously processed speech-text pairs, complete with detailed annotations for fraud reasoning. The dataset is divided into three tasks: scenario classification, fraud detection, fraud type classification. Furthermore, we construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized evaluation benchmark comprising proportionally sampled instances from the dataset, to facilitate systematic testing of model performance on telecom fraud detection tasks. We also contribute a production-optimized supervised fine-tuning (SFT) model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, while open-sourcing the data processing framework to enable community-driven dataset expansion. This work establishes a foundational framework for multimodal anti-fraud research while addressing critical challenges in data privacy and scenario diversity. The project will be released at this https URL.

# WinoWhat: A Parallel Corpus of Paraphrased WinoGrande Sentences with Common Sense Categorization 

**Authors**: Ine Gevers, Victor De Marez, Luna De Bruyne, Walter Daelemans  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23779)  

**Abstract**: In this study, we take a closer look at how Winograd schema challenges can be used to evaluate common sense reasoning in LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate generative models of different sizes on the popular WinoGrande benchmark. We release WinoWhat, a new corpus, in which each instance of the WinoGrande validation set is paraphrased. Additionally, we evaluate the performance on the challenge across five common sense knowledge categories, giving more fine-grained insights on what types of knowledge are more challenging for LLMs. Surprisingly, all models perform significantly worse on WinoWhat, implying that LLM reasoning capabilities are overestimated on WinoGrande. To verify whether this is an effect of benchmark memorization, we match benchmark instances to LLM trainingdata and create two test-suites. We observe that memorization has a minimal effect on model performance on WinoGrande.

# Large Language Models Pass the Turing Test 

**Authors**: Cameron R. Jones, Benjamin K. Bergen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23674)  

**Abstract**: We evaluated 4 systems (ELIZA, GPT-4o, LLaMa-3.1-405B, and GPT-4.5) in two randomised, controlled, and pre-registered Turing tests on independent populations. Participants had 5 minute conversations simultaneously with another human participant and one of these systems before judging which conversational partner they thought was human. When prompted to adopt a humanlike persona, GPT-4.5 was judged to be the human 73% of the time: significantly more often than interrogators selected the real human participant. LLaMa-3.1, with the same prompt, was judged to be the human 56% of the time -- not significantly more or less often than the humans they were being compared to -- while baseline models (ELIZA and GPT-4o) achieved win rates significantly below chance (23% and 21% respectively). The results constitute the first empirical evidence that any artificial system passes a standard three-party Turing test. The results have implications for debates about what kind of intelligence is exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs), and the social and economic impacts these systems are likely to have.

# BeMERC: Behavior-Aware MLLM-based Framework for Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation 

**Authors**: Yumeng Fu, Junjie Wu, Zhongjie Wang, Meishan Zhang, Yulin Wu, Bingquan Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23990)  

**Abstract**: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC), the task of identifying the emotion label for each utterance in a conversation, is vital for developing empathetic machines. Current MLLM-based MERC studies focus mainly on capturing the speaker's textual or vocal characteristics, but ignore the significance of video-derived behavior information. Different from text and audio inputs, learning videos with rich facial expression, body language and posture, provides emotion trigger signals to the models for more accurate emotion predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel behavior-aware MLLM-based framework (BeMERC) to incorporate speaker's behaviors, including subtle facial micro-expression, body language and posture, into a vanilla MLLM-based MERC model, thereby facilitating the modeling of emotional dynamics during a conversation. Furthermore, BeMERC adopts a two-stage instruction tuning strategy to extend the model to the conversations scenario for end-to-end training of a MERC predictor. Experiments demonstrate that BeMERC achieves superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, and also provides a detailed discussion on the significance of video-derived behavior information in MERC.

# Expanding RL with Verifiable Rewards Across Diverse Domains 

**Authors**: Yi Su, Dian Yu, Linfeng Song, Juntao Li, Haitao Mi, Zhaopeng Tu, Min Zhang, Dong Yu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23829)  

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown promising results in mathematical reasoning and coding tasks where well-structured reference answers are available. However, its applicability to broader domains remains underexplored. In this work, we study the extension of RLVR to more diverse domains such as medicine, chemistry, psychology, and economics. We observe high agreement in binary judgments across different large language models (LLMs) when objective reference answers exist, which challenges the necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward models. To address the limitations of binary rewards when handling unstructured reference answers, we further incorporate model-based soft scoring into RLVR to improve its flexibility. Our experiments show that a distilled generative reward model can serve as an effective cross-domain verifier, providing reliable reward signals for RL without requiring domain-specific annotations. By fine-tuning a base 7B model using various RL algorithms against our reward model, we obtain policies that outperform state-of-the-art open-source aligned LLMs such as Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by a large margin, across domains in free-form answer settings. This also strengthens RLVR's robustness and scalability, highlighting its potential for real-world applications with noisy or weak labels.

# AdaMMS: Model Merging for Heterogeneous Multimodal Large Language Models with Unsupervised Coefficient Optimization 

**Authors**: Yiyang Du, Xiaochen Wang, Chi Chen, Jiabo Ye, Yiru Wang, Peng Li, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Zhifang Sui, Maosong Sun, Yang Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23733)  

**Abstract**: Recently, model merging methods have demonstrated powerful strengths in combining abilities on various tasks from multiple Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous model merging methods mainly focus on merging homogeneous models with identical architecture, they meet challenges when dealing with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with inherent heterogeneous property, including differences in model architecture and the asymmetry in the parameter space. In this work, we propose AdaMMS, a novel model merging method tailored for heterogeneous MLLMs. Our method tackles the challenges in three steps: mapping, merging and searching. Specifically, we first design mapping function between models to apply model merging on MLLMs with different architecture. Then we apply linear interpolation on model weights to actively adapt the asymmetry in the heterogeneous MLLMs. Finally in the hyper-parameter searching step, we propose an unsupervised hyper-parameter selection method for model merging. As the first model merging method capable of merging heterogeneous MLLMs without labeled data, extensive experiments on various model combinations demonstrated that AdaMMS outperforms previous model merging methods on various vision-language benchmarks.

# MKA: Leveraging Cross-Lingual Consensus for Model Abstention 

**Authors**: Sharad Duwal  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23687)  

**Abstract**: Reliability of LLMs is questionable even as they get better at more tasks. A wider adoption of LLMs is contingent on whether they are usably factual. And if they are not, on whether they can properly calibrate their confidence in their responses. This work focuses on utilizing the multilingual knowledge of an LLM to inform its decision to abstain or answer when prompted. We develop a multilingual pipeline to calibrate the model's confidence and let it abstain when uncertain. We run several multilingual models through the pipeline to profile them across different languages. We find that the performance of the pipeline varies by model and language, but that in general they benefit from it. This is evidenced by the accuracy improvement of $71.2\%$ for Bengali over a baseline performance without the pipeline. Even a high-resource language like English sees a $15.5\%$ improvement. These results hint at possible further improvements.

# Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting for Enhancing Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Haochen Liu, Song Wang, Chen Chen, Jundong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23523)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with tasks requiring external knowledge, such as knowledge-intensive Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA). Integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can enhance reasoning; however, existing methods typically demand costly fine-tuning or retrieve noisy KG information. Recent approaches leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate KG-based input embedding prefixes as soft prompts for LLMs but fail to account for question relevance, resulting in noisy prompts. Moreover, in MCQA tasks, the absence of relevant KG knowledge for certain answer options remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose Question-Aware Knowledge Graph Prompting (QAP), which incorporates question embeddings into GNN aggregation to dynamically assess KG relevance. QAP employs global attention to capture inter-option relationships, enriching soft prompts with inferred knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that QAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, highlighting its effectiveness.

# SCORE: Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement for AI Narratives 

**Authors**: Qiang Yi, Yangfan He, Jianhui Wang, Xinyuan Song, Shiyao Qian, Miao Zhang, Li Sun, Tianyu Shi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23512)  

**Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating creative narratives but struggle with long-term coherence and emotional consistency in complex stories. To address this, we propose SCORE (Story Coherence and Retrieval Enhancement), a framework integrating three components: 1) Dynamic State Tracking (monitoring objects/characters via symbolic logic), 2) Context-Aware Summarization (hierarchical episode summaries for temporal progression), and 3) Hybrid Retrieval (combining TF-IDF keyword relevance with cosine similarity-based semantic embeddings). The system employs a temporally-aligned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to validate contextual consistency. Evaluations show SCORE achieves 23.6% higher coherence (NCI-2.0 benchmark), 89.7% emotional consistency (EASM metric), and 41.8% fewer hallucinations versus baseline GPT models. Its modular design supports incremental knowledge graph construction for persistent story memory and multi-LLM backend compatibility, offering an explainable solution for industrial-scale narrative systems requiring long-term consistency.

# Evolutionary Prompt Optimization Discovers Emergent Multimodal Reasoning Strategies in Vision-Language Models 

**Authors**: Sid Bharthulwar, John Rho, Katrina Brown  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23503)  

**Abstract**: We present a framework for optimizing prompts in vision-language models to elicit multimodal reasoning without model retraining. Using an evolutionary algorithm to guide prompt updates downstream of visual tasks, our approach improves upon baseline prompt-updating algorithms, which lack evolution-style "survival of the fittest" iteration. Crucially, we find this approach enables the language model to independently discover progressive problem-solving techniques across several evolution generations. For example, the model reasons that to "break down" visually complex spatial tasks, making a tool call to a Python interpreter to perform tasks (such as cropping, image segmentation, or saturation changes) would improve performance significantly. Our experimentation shows that explicitly evoking this "tool calling" call, via system-level XML $...\texttt{<tool>} ... \texttt{</tool>}...$ tags, can effectively flag Python interpreter access for the same language model to generate relevant programs, generating advanced multimodal functionality. This functionality can be crystallized into a system-level prompt that induces improved performance at inference time, and our experimentation suggests up to $\approx 50\%$ relative improvement across select visual tasks. Downstream performance is trained and evaluated across subtasks from MathVista, M3CoT, and GeoBench-VLM datasets. Importantly, our approach shows that evolutionary prompt optimization guides language models towards self-reasoning discoveries, which result in improved zero-shot generalization across tasks.

# RARE: Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Modeling 

**Authors**: Zhengren Wang, Jiayang Yu, Dongsheng Ma, Zhe Chen, Yu Wang, Zhiyu Li, Feiyu Xiong, Yanfeng Wang, Weinan E, Linpeng Tang, Wentao Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23513)  

**Abstract**: Domain-specific intelligence demands specialized knowledge and sophisticated reasoning for problem-solving, posing significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) that struggle with knowledge hallucination and inadequate reasoning capabilities under constrained parameter budgets. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy in educational theory, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning Modeling (RARE), a novel paradigm that decouples knowledge storage from reasoning optimization. RARE externalizes domain knowledge to retrievable sources and internalizes domain-specific reasoning patterns during training. Specifically, by injecting retrieved knowledge into training prompts, RARE transforms learning objectives from rote memorization to contextualized reasoning application. It enables models to bypass parameter-intensive memorization and prioritize the development of higher-order cognitive processes. Our experiments demonstrate that lightweight RARE-trained models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) could achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing retrieval-augmented GPT-4 and Deepseek-R1 distilled counterparts. RARE establishes a paradigm shift where maintainable external knowledge bases synergize with compact, reasoning-optimized models, collectively driving more scalable domain-specific intelligence.

# Building Instruction-Tuning Datasets from Human-Written Instructions with Open-Weight Large Language Models 

**Authors**: Youmi Ma, Sakae Mizuki, Kazuki Fujii, Taishi Nakamura, Masanari Ohi, Hinari Shimada, Taihei Shiotani, Koshiro Saito, Koki Maeda, Kakeru Hattori, Takumi Okamoto, Shigeki Ishida, Rio Yokota, Hiroya Takamura, Naoaki Okazaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23714)  

**Abstract**: Instruction tuning is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve real-world tasks. Prior work has shown the effectiveness of instruction-tuning data synthesized solely from LLMs, raising a fundamental question: Do we still need human-originated signals for instruction tuning? This work answers the question affirmatively: we build state-of-the-art instruction-tuning datasets sourced from human-written instructions, by simply pairing them with LLM-generated responses. LLMs fine-tuned on our datasets consistently outperform those fine-tuned on existing ones. Our data construction approach can be easily adapted to other languages; we build datasets for Japanese and confirm that LLMs tuned with our data reach state-of-the-art performance. Analyses suggest that instruction-tuning in a new language allows LLMs to follow instructions, while the tuned models exhibit a notable lack of culture-specific knowledge in that language. The datasets and fine-tuned models will be publicly available. Our datasets, synthesized with open-weight LLMs, are openly distributed under permissive licenses, allowing for diverse use cases.

# When LLM Therapists Become Salespeople: Evaluating Large Language Models for Ethical Motivational Interviewing 

**Authors**: Haein Kong, Seonghyeon Moon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23566)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have been actively applied in the mental health field. Recent research shows the promise of LLMs in applying psychotherapy, especially motivational interviewing (MI). However, there is a lack of studies investigating how language models understand MI ethics. Given the risks that malicious actors can use language models to apply MI for unethical purposes, it is important to evaluate their capability of differentiating ethical and unethical MI practices. Thus, this study investigates the ethical awareness of LLMs in MI with multiple experiments. Our findings show that LLMs have a moderate to strong level of knowledge in MI. However, their ethical standards are not aligned with the MI spirit, as they generated unethical responses and performed poorly in detecting unethical responses. We proposed a Chain-of-Ethic prompt to mitigate those risks and improve safety. Finally, our proposed strategy effectively improved ethical MI response generation and detection performance. These findings highlight the need for safety evaluations and guidelines for building ethical LLM-powered psychotherapy.

# Mapping Geopolitical Bias in 11 Large Language Models: A Bilingual, Dual-Framing Analysis of U.S.-China Tensions 

**Authors**: William Guey, Pierrick Bougault, Vitor D. de Moura, Wei Zhang, Jose O. Gomes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23688)  

**Abstract**: This study systematically analyzes geopolitical bias across 11 prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) by examining their responses to seven critical topics in U.S.-China relations. Utilizing a bilingual (English and Chinese) and dual-framing (affirmative and reverse) methodology, we generated 19,712 prompts designed to detect ideological leanings in model outputs. Responses were quantitatively assessed on a normalized scale from -2 (strongly Pro-China) to +2 (strongly Pro-U.S.) and categorized according to stance, neutrality, and refusal rates. The findings demonstrate significant and consistent ideological alignments correlated with the LLMs' geographic origins; U.S.-based models predominantly favored Pro-U.S. stances, while Chinese-origin models exhibited pronounced Pro-China biases. Notably, language and prompt framing substantially influenced model responses, with several LLMs exhibiting stance reversals based on prompt polarity or linguistic context. Additionally, we introduced comprehensive metrics to evaluate response consistency across languages and framing conditions, identifying variability and vulnerabilities in model behaviors. These results offer practical insights that can guide organizations and individuals in selecting LLMs best aligned with their operational priorities and geopolitical considerations, underscoring the importance of careful model evaluation in politically sensitive applications. Furthermore, the research highlights specific prompt structures and linguistic variations that can strategically trigger distinct responses from models, revealing methods for effectively navigating and influencing LLM outputs.

# Discovering Knowledge Deficiencies of Language Models on Massive Knowledge Base 

**Authors**: Linxin Song, Xuwei Ding, Jieyu Zhang, Taiwei Shi, Ryotaro Shimizu, Rahul Gupta, Yang Liu, Jian Kang, Jieyu Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23361)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) possess impressive linguistic capabilities but often fail to faithfully retain factual knowledge, leading to hallucinations and unreliable outputs. Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively. Human evaluation confirms the high quality of generated questions, while ablation and convergence analyses validate the contribution of each component in SEA. Further analysis on the discovered errors reveals correlated failure patterns across LLM families and recurring deficits, highlighting the need for better data coverage and targeted fine-tuning in future LLM development.

# Not All LoRA Parameters Are Essential: Insights on Inference Necessity 

**Authors**: Guanhua Chen, Yutong Yao, Ci-Jun Gao, Lidia S. Chao, Feng Wan, Derek F. Wong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23360)  

**Abstract**: Current research on LoRA primarily focuses on minimizing the number of fine-tuned parameters or optimizing its architecture. However, the necessity of all fine-tuned LoRA layers during inference remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the contribution of each LoRA layer to the model's ability to predict the ground truth and hypothesize that lower-layer LoRA modules play a more critical role in model reasoning and understanding. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned with LoRA. Specifically, we identify a ``boundary layer'' that distinguishes essential LoRA layers by analyzing a small set of validation samples. During inference, we drop all LoRA layers beyond this boundary. We evaluate our approach on three strong baselines across four widely-used text generation datasets. Our results demonstrate consistent and significant improvements, underscoring the effectiveness of selectively retaining critical LoRA layers during inference.

# ToRL: Scaling Tool-Integrated RL 

**Authors**: Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou, Pengfei Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23383)  

**Abstract**: We introduce ToRL (Tool-Integrated Reinforcement Learning), a framework for training large language models (LLMs) to autonomously use computational tools via reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised fine-tuning, ToRL allows models to explore and discover optimal strategies for tool use. Experiments with Qwen2.5-Math models show significant improvements: ToRL-7B reaches 43.3\% accuracy on AIME~24, surpassing reinforcement learning without tool integration by 14\% and the best existing Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) model by 17\%. Further analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as strategic tool invocation, self-regulation of ineffective code, and dynamic adaptation between computational and analytical reasoning, all arising purely through reward-driven learning.

# Focus Directions Make Your Language Models Pay More Attention to Relevant Contexts 

**Authors**: Youxiang Zhu, Ruochen Li, Danqing Wang, Daniel Haehn, Xiaohui Liang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23306)  

**Abstract**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are prone to be distracted by irrelevant contexts. The reason for distraction remains poorly understood. In this paper, we first identify the contextual heads, a special group of attention heads that control the overall attention of the LLM. Then, we demonstrate that distraction arises when contextual heads fail to allocate sufficient attention to relevant contexts and can be mitigated by increasing attention to these contexts. We further identify focus directions, located at the key and query activations of these heads, which enable them to allocate more attention to relevant contexts without explicitly specifying which context is relevant. We comprehensively evaluate the effect of focus direction on various long-context tasks and find out focus directions could help to mitigate the poor task alignment of the long-context LLMs. We believe our findings could promote further research on long-context LLM alignment.

# Cocktail: Chunk-Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization for Long-Context LLM Inference 

**Authors**: Wei Tao, Bin Zhang, Xiaoyang Qu, Jiguang Wan, Jianzong Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23294)  

**Abstract**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been able to handle longer and longer contexts. However, a context that is too long may cause intolerant inference latency and GPU memory usage. Existing methods propose mixed-precision quantization to the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs based on token granularity, which is time-consuming in the search process and hardware inefficient during computation. This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.

# PromptDistill: Query-based Selective Token Retention in Intermediate Layers for Efficient Large Language Model Inference 

**Authors**: Weisheng Jin, Maojia Song, Tej Deep Pala, Yew Ken Chia, Amir Zadeh, Chuan Li, Soujanya Poria  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23274)  

**Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) tackle increasingly complex tasks and longer documents, their computational and memory costs during inference become a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose PromptDistill, a novel, training-free method that improves inference efficiency while preserving generation quality. PromptDistill identifies and retains the most informative tokens by leveraging attention interactions in early layers, preserving their hidden states while reducing the computational burden in later layers. This allows the model to focus on essential contextual information without fully processing all tokens. Unlike previous methods such as H2O and SnapKV, which perform compression only after processing the entire input, or GemFilter, which selects a fixed portion of the initial prompt without considering contextual dependencies, PromptDistill dynamically allocates computational resources to the most relevant tokens while maintaining a global awareness of the input. Experiments using our method and baseline approaches with base models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, Phi 3.5 Mini Instruct, and Qwen2 7B Instruct on benchmarks including LongBench, InfBench, and Needle in a Haystack demonstrate that PromptDistill significantly improves efficiency while having minimal impact on output quality compared to the original models. With a single-stage selection strategy, PromptDistill effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming prior methods like GemFilter, H2O, and SnapKV due to its superior ability to retain essential information. Specifically, compared to GemFilter, PromptDistill achieves an overall $1\%$ to $5\%$ performance improvement while also offering better time efficiency. Additionally, we explore multi-stage selection, which further improves efficiency while maintaining strong generation performance.

# EventWeave: A Dynamic Framework for Capturing Core and Supporting Events in Dialogue Systems 

**Authors**: Zhengyi Zhao, Shubo Zhang, Yiming Du, Bin Liang, Baojun Wang, Zhongyang Li, Binyang Li, Kam-Fai Wong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23078)  

**Abstract**: Existing large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue systems. However, many approaches still overlook the fundamental role of events throughout multi-turn interactions, leading to \textbf{incomplete context tracking}. Without tracking these events, dialogue systems often lose coherence and miss subtle shifts in user intent, causing disjointed responses. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{EventWeave}, an event-centric framework that identifies and updates both core and supporting events as the conversation unfolds. Specifically, we organize these events into a dynamic event graph, which represents the interplay between \textbf{core events} that shape the primary idea and \textbf{supporting events} that provide critical context during the whole dialogue. By leveraging this dynamic graph, EventWeave helps models focus on the most relevant events when generating responses, thus avoiding repeated visits of the entire dialogue history. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that EventWeave improves response quality and event relevance without fine-tuning.

**Authors**: Yue Liu, Jiaying Wu, Yufei He, Hongcheng Gao, Hongyu Chen, Baolong Bi, Jiaheng Zhang, Zhiqi Huang, Bryan Hooi

**Abstract**: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) significantly improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning to reason, exhibiting promising performance in complex task-solving. However, their deliberative reasoning process leads to inefficiencies in token usage, memory consumption, and inference time. Thus, this survey provides a review of efficient inference methods designed specifically for LRMs, focusing on mitigating token inefficiency while preserving the reasoning quality. First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field\footnote{this https URL}.

# A Training-free LLM Framework with Interaction between Contextually Related Subtasks in Solving Complex Tasks 

**Authors**: Hongjia Liu, Jinlong Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23053)  

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving complex tasks. Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks with independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may encounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or execution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework with an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific information or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending requests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to enable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests. Additionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a concise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask, to assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests. We evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and multi-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free baselines.

# FReM: A Flexible Reasoning Mechanism for Balancing Quick and Slow Thinking in Long-Context Question Answering 

**Authors**: Zhengyi Zhao, Shubo Zhang, Zezhong Wang, Bin Liang, Binyang Li, Kam-Fai Wong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22985)  

**Abstract**: Long-context question-answering (LCQA) systems have greatly benefited from the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), which can be categorized into slow and quick reasoning modes. However, both modes have their limitations. Slow thinking generally leans to explore every possible reasoning path, which leads to heavy overthinking and wastes time. Quick thinking usually relies on pattern matching rather than truly understanding the query logic, which misses proper understanding. To address these issues, we propose FReM: Flexible Reasoning Mechanism, a method that adjusts reasoning depth according to the complexity of each question. Specifically, FReM leverages synthetic reference QA examples to provide an explicit chain of thought, enabling efficient handling of simple queries while allowing deeper reasoning for more complex ones. By doing so, FReM helps quick-thinking models move beyond superficial pattern matching and narrows the reasoning space for slow-thinking models to avoid unnecessary exploration. Experiments on seven QA datasets show that FReM improves reasoning accuracy and scalability, particularly for complex multihop questions, indicating its potential to advance LCQA methodologies.

# Learning to Reason for Long-Form Story Generation 

**Authors**: Alexander Gurung, Mirella Lapata  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22828)  

**Abstract**: Generating high-quality stories spanning thousands of tokens requires competency across a variety of skills, from tracking plot and character arcs to keeping a consistent and engaging style. Due to the difficulty of sourcing labeled datasets and precise quality measurements, most work using large language models (LLMs) for long-form story generation uses combinations of hand-designed prompting techniques to elicit author-like behavior. This is a manual process that is highly dependent on the specific story-generation task. Motivated by the recent success of applying RL with Verifiable Rewards to domains like math and coding, we propose a general story-generation task (Next-Chapter Prediction) and a reward formulation (Verified Rewards via Completion Likelihood Improvement) that allows us to use an unlabeled book dataset as a learning signal for reasoning. We learn to reason over a story's condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines. Pairwise human judgments reveal the chapters our learned reasoning produces are preferred across almost all metrics, and the effect is more pronounced in Scifi and Fantasy genres.

# A Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge Mining Method with Deep Thinking LLMs for Biomedical Research and Clinical Support 

**Authors**: Yichun Feng, Jiawei Wang, Ruikun He, Lu Zhou, Yixue Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23029)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge graphs and large language models (LLMs) are key tools for biomedical knowledge integration and reasoning, facilitating structured organization of scientific articles and discovery of complex semantic relationships. However, current methods face challenges: knowledge graph construction is limited by complex terminology, data heterogeneity, and rapid knowledge evolution, while LLMs show limitations in retrieval and reasoning, making it difficult to uncover cross-document associations and reasoning pathways. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline that uses LLMs to construct a biomedical knowledge graph (BioStrataKG) from large-scale articles and builds a cross-document question-answering dataset (BioCDQA) to evaluate latent knowledge retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. We then introduce Integrated and Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (IP-RAR) to enhance retrieval accuracy and knowledge reasoning. IP-RAR maximizes information recall through Integrated Reasoning-based Retrieval and refines knowledge via Progressive Reasoning-based Generation, using self-reflection to achieve deep thinking and precise contextual understanding. Experiments show that IP-RAR improves document retrieval F1 score by 20\% and answer generation accuracy by 25\% over existing methods. This framework helps doctors efficiently integrate treatment evidence for personalized medication plans and enables researchers to analyze advancements and research gaps, accelerating scientific discovery and decision-making.

# Generating Synthetic Oracle Datasets to Analyze Noise Impact: A Study on Building Function Classification Using Tweets 

**Authors**: Shanshan Bai, Anna Kruspe, Xiaoxiang Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22856)  

**Abstract**: Tweets provides valuable semantic context for earth observation tasks and serves as a complementary modality to remote sensing imagery. In building function classification (BFC), tweets are often collected using geographic heuristics and labeled via external databases, an inherently weakly supervised process that introduces both label noise and sentence level feature noise (e.g., irrelevant or uninformative tweets). While label noise has been widely studied, the impact of sentence level feature noise remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of clean benchmark datasets for controlled analysis. In this work, we propose a method for generating a synthetic oracle dataset using LLM, designed to contain only tweets that are both correctly labeled and semantically relevant to their associated buildings. This oracle dataset enables systematic investigation of noise impacts that are otherwise difficult to isolate in real-world data. To assess its utility, we compare model performance using Naive Bayes and mBERT classifiers under three configurations: real vs. synthetic training data, and cross-domain generalization. Results show that noise in real tweets significantly degrades the contextual learning capacity of mBERT, reducing its performance to that of a simple keyword-based model. In contrast, the clean synthetic dataset allows mBERT to learn effectively, outperforming Naive Bayes Bayes by a large margin. These findings highlight that addressing feature noise is more critical than model complexity in this task. Our synthetic dataset offers a novel experimental environment for future noise injection studies and is publicly available on GitHub.

# Resona: Improving Context Copying in Linear Recurrence Models with Retrieval 

**Authors**: Xinyu Wang, Linrui Ma, Jerry Huang, Peng Lu, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Xiao-Wen Chang, Boxing Chen, Yufei Cui  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22913)  

**Abstract**: Recent shifts in the space of large language model (LLM) research have shown an increasing focus on novel architectures to compete with prototypical Transformer-based models that have long dominated this space. Linear recurrent models have proven to be a viable competitor due to their computational efficiency. However, such models still demonstrate a sizable gap compared to Transformers in terms of in-context learning among other tasks that require recalling information from a context. In this work, we introduce __Resona__, a simple and scalable framework for augmenting linear recurrent models with retrieval. __Resona__~augments models with the ability to integrate retrieved information from the provided input context, enabling tailored behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments on a variety of linear recurrent models demonstrate that __Resona__-augmented models observe significant performance gains on a variety of synthetic as well as real-world natural language tasks, highlighting its ability to act as a general purpose method to improve the in-context learning and language modeling abilities of linear recurrent LLMs.

# Short-video Propagation Influence Rating: A New Real-world Dataset and A New Large Graph Model 

**Authors**: Dizhan Xue, Jing Cui, Shengsheng Qian, Chuanrui Hu, Changsheng Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23746)  

**Abstract**: Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the interest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers have highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos, which typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user behaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence Rating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method perspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video) dataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video propagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on short-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926 samples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the propagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or provides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment content. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a novel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured data with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation graph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of short-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both classification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the superiority of our method for SPIR.

# Can DeepSeek-V3 Reason Like a Surgeon? An Empirical Evaluation for Vision-Language Understanding in Robotic-Assisted Surgery 

**Authors**: Boyi Ma, Yanguang Zhao, Jie Wang, Guankun Wang, Kun Yuan, Tong Chen, Long Bai, Hongliang Ren  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23130)  

**Abstract**: DeepSeek-V3, a recently emerging Large Language Model (LLM), demonstrates outstanding performance in general scene understanding, question-answering (QA), and text generation tasks, owing to its efficient training paradigm and strong reasoning capabilities. In this study, we investigate the dialogue capabilities of DeepSeek-V3 in robotic surgery scenarios, focusing on tasks such as Single Phrase QA, Visual QA, and Detailed Description. The Single Phrase QA tasks further include sub-tasks such as surgical instrument recognition, action understanding, and spatial position analysis. We conduct extensive evaluations using publicly available datasets, including EndoVis18 and CholecT50, along with their corresponding dialogue data. Our comprehensive evaluation results indicate that, when provided with specific prompts, DeepSeek-V3 performs well in surgical instrument and tissue recognition tasks However, DeepSeek-V3 exhibits significant limitations in spatial position analysis and struggles to understand surgical actions accurately. Additionally, our findings reveal that, under general prompts, DeepSeek-V3 lacks the ability to effectively analyze global surgical concepts and fails to provide detailed insights into surgical scenarios. Based on our observations, we argue that the DeepSeek-V3 is not ready for vision-language tasks in surgical contexts without fine-tuning on surgery-specific datasets.

# Agentic Large Language Models, a survey 

**Authors**: Aske Plaat, Max van Duijn, Niki van Stein, Mike Preuss, Peter van der Putten, Kees Joost Batenburg  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23037)  

**Abstract**: There is great interest in agentic LLMs, large language models that act as agents. We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.

# Reasoning Beyond Limits: Advances and Open Problems for LLMs 

**Authors**: Mohamed Amine Ferrag, Norbert Tihanyi, Merouane Debbah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22732)  

**Abstract**: Recent generative reasoning breakthroughs have transformed how large language models (LLMs) tackle complex problems by dynamically retrieving and refining information while generating coherent, multi-step thought processes. Techniques such as inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and distillation have been successfully applied to models like DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1 & o3, GPT-4o, Qwen-32B, and various Llama variants, resulting in enhanced reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the top 27 LLM models released between 2023 and 2025 (including models such as Mistral AI Small 3 24B, DeepSeek-R1, Search-o1, QwQ-32B, and phi-4). Then, we present an extensive overview of training methodologies that spans general training approaches, mixture-of-experts (MoE) and architectural innovations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought and self-improvement techniques, as well as test-time compute scaling, distillation, and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in advancing LLM capabilities, including improving multi-step reasoning without human supervision, overcoming limitations in chained tasks, balancing structured prompts with flexibility, and enhancing long-context retrieval and external tool integration.

# InfoBid: A Simulation Framework for Studying Information Disclosure in Auctions with Large Language Model-based Agents 

**Authors**: Yue Yin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22726)  

**Abstract**: In online advertising systems, publishers often face a trade-off in information disclosure strategies: while disclosing more information can enhance efficiency by enabling optimal allocation of ad impressions, it may lose revenue potential by decreasing uncertainty among competing advertisers. Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.
