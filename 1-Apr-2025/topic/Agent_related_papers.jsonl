To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding."}

Yet, prior work either incorporates only one of these abilities in an end-to-end agent or integrates multiple specialized models into an agent system, limiting the learning efficiency and generalization of the policy. Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance.'}

Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior.

Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour.

In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance. Extensive experiments on Kaggle and OpenML datasets demonstrate that SPIO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a robust and scalable solution for automated data science task.'}

To address these challenges, we introduce AstroAgents, a large language model-based, multi-agent AI system for hypothesis generation from mass spectrometry data. AstroAgents is structured around eight collaborative agents: a data analyst, a planner, three domain scientists, an accumulator, a literature reviewer, and a critic. The system processes mass spectrometry data alongside user-provided research papers. The data analyst interprets the data, and the planner delegates specific segments to the scientist agents for in-depth exploration. The accumulator then collects and deduplicates the generated hypotheses, and the literature reviewer identifies relevant literature using Semantic Scholar. The critic evaluates the hypotheses, offering rigorous suggestions for improvement. To assess AstroAgents, an astrobiology expert evaluated the novelty and plausibility of more than a hundred hypotheses generated from data obtained from eight meteorites and ten soil samples.

However, the high-security status of such facilities may restrict modelers from deploying human activity sensors for data collection. This problem was encountered when deploying MetaPOL, a digital twin system to prevent insider threat or sabotage of secure facilities, at a secure nuclear reactor facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

We also find that NPC movement in the VR environment driven by the deep neural networks under normal operations remain significantly different to that seen when simulating responses to a simulated emergency scenario.'}

F. X. Teixeira, Ke Wang, Alex Aiken', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23145', 'abstract': 'Inductive program synthesis, or programming by example, requires synthesizing functions from input-output examples that generalize to unseen inputs. While large language model agents have shown promise in programming tasks guided by natural language, their ability to perform inductive program synthesis is underexplored. Existing evaluation protocols rely on static sets of examples and held-out tests, offering no feedback when synthesized functions are incorrect and failing to reflect real-world scenarios such as reverse engineering. We propose CodeARC, the Code Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge, a new evaluation framework where agents interact with a hidden target function by querying it with new inputs, synthesizing candidate functions, and iteratively refining their solutions using a differential testing oracle. This interactive setting encourages agents to perform function calls and self-correction based on feedback. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for general-purpose inductive program synthesis, featuring 1114 functions. Among 18 models evaluated, o3-mini performs best with a success rate of 52.7%, highlighting the difficulty of this task. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on curated synthesis traces yields up to a 31% relative performance gain. CodeARC provides a more realistic and challenging testbed for evaluating LLM-based program synthesis and inductive reasoning.'}

Our approach achieves better variation performance than the state-of-the-art layout techniques. Notably, this is the first application of multi-agent RL in analog layout automation.

However, the performance of LLMs varies across geographic regions. In this paper, we evaluate the factual accuracy of open and private models across a diverse set of regions and scenarios.\nUsing a dataset containing 600 fact-checked statements balanced across six global regions we examine three experimental setups of fact-checking a statement: (1) when just the statement is available, (2) when an LLM-based agent with Wikipedia access is utilized, and (3) as a best case scenario when a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system provided with the official fact check is employed. Our findings reveal that regardless of the scenario and LLM used, including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, and LLaMA, statements from the Global North perform substantially better than those from the Global South. Furthermore, this gap is broadened for the more realistic case of a Wikipedia agent-based system, highlighting that overly general knowledge bases have a limited ability to address region-specific nuances. These results underscore the urgent need for better dataset balancing and robust retrieval strategies to enhance LLM fact-checking capabilities, particularly in geographically diverse contexts.'}

Traditional navigation methods focus on optimal trajectory generation within free space, struggling in environments lacking viable paths to the goal, such as disaster zones or cluttered warehouses. To address this gap, we propose an adaptive interactive navigation approach that proactively interacts with environments to create feasible paths to reach originally unavailable goals. Specifically, we present a primitive tree for task planning with large language models (LLMs), facilitating effective reasoning to determine interaction objects and sequences. To ensure robust subtask execution, we adopt reinforcement learning to pre-train a comprehensive skill library containing versatile locomotion and interaction behaviors for motion planning. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive replanning method featuring two LLM-based modules: an advisor serving as a flexible replanning trigger and an arborist for autonomous plan adjustment. Integrated with the tree structure, the replanning mechanism allows for convenient node addition and pruning, enabling rapid plan modification in unknown environments. Comprehensive simulations and experiments have demonstrated our method's effectiveness and adaptivity in diverse scenarios. The supplementary video is available at page: this https URL."}

This occurs when the reward function incentivizes proxy behaviors that diverge from the true objective. While human-in-the-loop (HIL) methods can help, they may exacerbate the problem, as humans are prone to biases that lead to inconsistent, subjective, or misaligned feedback, complicating the learning process. To address these issues, we propose two key contributions. First, we extend the use of zero-shot, off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) for reward shaping beyond natural language processing (NLP) to continuous control tasks. By leveraging LLMs as direct feedback providers, we replace surrogate models trained on human feedback, which often suffer from the bias inherent in the feedback data it is trained on. Second, we introduce a hybrid framework (LLM-HFBF) that enables LLMs to identify and correct biases in human feedback while incorporating this feedback into the reward shaping process. The LLM-HFBF framework creates a more balanced and reliable system by addressing both the limitations of LLMs (e.g., lack of domain-specific knowledge) and human supervision (e.g., inherent biases). By enabling human feedback bias flagging and correction, our approach improves reinforcement learning performance and reduces reliance on potentially biased human guidance. Empirical experiments show that biased human feedback significantly reduces performance, with average episodic reward (AER) dropping from 28.472 in (unbiased approaches) to 7.039 (biased with conservative bias). In contrast, LLM-based approaches maintain a matching AER like unbiased feedback, even in custom edge case scenarios.'}

A common approach to denoising this feedback is manually crafting rules based on observations of training loss patterns. However, this approach is labor-intensive and the resulting rules often lack generalization across diverse scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RuleAgent, a language agent based framework which mimics real-world data experts to autonomously discover rules for recommendation denoising. Unlike the high-cost process of manual rule mining, RuleAgent offers rapid and dynamic rule discovery, ensuring adaptability to evolving data and varying scenarios. To achieve this, RuleAgent is equipped with tailored profile, memory, planning, and action modules and leverages reflection mechanisms to enhance its reasoning capabilities for rule discovery. Furthermore, to avoid the frequent retraining in rule discovery, we propose LossEraser-an unlearning strategy that streamlines training without compromising denoising performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, compared with existing denoising methods, RuleAgent not only derives the optimal recommendation performance but also produces generalizable denoising rules, assisting researchers in efficient data cleaning.'}

Specifically, Agent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, how robust Agent4RSs are remains unexplored. As such, in this paper, we propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories, not only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and robustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents.\nGiven the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch attacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim models cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often stealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module, a strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to produce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used to achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy module is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories cannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the triggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the surrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the attacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides critical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient Agent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DrunkAgent."}

Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks with independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may encounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or execution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework with an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific information or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending requests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to enable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests. Additionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a concise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask, to assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests. We evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and multi-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free baselines.'}

Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.'}
