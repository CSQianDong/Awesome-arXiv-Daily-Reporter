While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field.'}

These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems.

We investigate this by (1) building a model of analogical reasoning using similarity over lexical items, and (2) asking human participants to reason by analogy. While we find that this strategy works well for a large proportion of the dataset of Ross et al.

It involves identifying pieces of text that deviate in some way from previously known information. However, novelty is also a crucial determinant of the unique perception of relevance and quality of an experience, as it rests upon each individual's understanding of the world. Social factors, particularly cultural background, profoundly influence perceptions of novelty and innovation. Cultural novelty arises from differences in salience and novelty as shaped by the distance between distinct communities. While cultural diversity has garnered increasing attention in artificial intelligence (AI), the lack of robust metrics for quantifying cultural novelty hinders a deeper understanding of these divergences. This gap limits quantifying and understanding cultural differences within computational frameworks. To address this, we propose an interdisciplinary framework that integrates knowledge from sociology and management. Central to our approach is GlobalFusion, a novel dataset comprising 500 dishes and approximately 100,000 cooking recipes capturing cultural adaptation from over 150 countries. By introducing a set of Jensen-Shannon Divergence metrics for novelty, we leverage this dataset to analyze textual divergences when recipes from one community are modified by another with a different cultural background. The results reveal significant correlations between our cultural novelty metrics and established cultural measures based on linguistic, religious, and geographical distances.

However, researchers in the machine translation community usually assess translations using a single score intended to capture semantic accuracy and the naturalness of the output simultaneously. In this paper, we build on recent advances in information theory to mathematically prove and empirically demonstrate that such single-score summaries do not and cannot give the complete picture of a system's true performance. Concretely, we prove that a tradeoff exists between accuracy and naturalness and demonstrate it by evaluating the submissions to the WMT24 shared task. Our findings help explain well-known empirical phenomena, such as the observation that optimizing translation systems for a specific accuracy metric (like BLEU) initially improves the system's naturalness, while ``overfitting'' the system to the metric can significantly degrade its naturalness. Thus, we advocate for a change in how translations are evaluated: rather than comparing systems using a single number, they should be compared on an accuracy-naturalness plane."}

This study investigated whether the release of these two popular LLMs coincided with a change in writing style in headlines and links on worldwide news websites. 175 NLP features were obtained for each text in a dataset of 451 million headlines/links. An interrupted time series analysis was applied for each of the 175 NLP features to evaluate whether there were any statistically significant sustained changes after the release dates of ChatGPT and/or Copilot. There were a total of 44 features that did not appear to have any significant sustained change after the release of ChatGPT/Copilot. A total of 91 other features did show significant change with ChatGPT and/or Copilot although significance with earlier control LLM release dates (GPT-1/2/3, Gopher) removed them from consideration. This initial analysis suggests these language models may have had a limited impact on the style of individual news headlines/links, with respect to only some NLP measures.'}

However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration."}

However, their effectiveness in fine-grained tasks remains an open question. In everyday scenarios, individuals encountering design materials, such as magazines, typography tutorials, research papers, or branding content, may wish to identify aesthetically pleasing fonts used in the text. Given their multimodal capabilities and free accessibility, many VLMs are often considered potential tools for font recognition. This raises a fundamental question: Do VLMs truly possess the capability to recognize fonts? To investigate this, we introduce the Font Recognition Benchmark (FRB), a compact and well-structured dataset comprising 15 commonly used fonts. FRB includes two versions: (i) an easy version, where 10 sentences are rendered in different fonts, and (ii) a hard version, where each text sample consists of the names of the 15 fonts themselves, introducing a stroop effect that challenges model perception. Through extensive evaluation of various VLMs on font recognition tasks, we arrive at the following key findings: (i) Current VLMs exhibit limited font recognition capabilities, with many state-of-the-art models failing to achieve satisfactory performance. (ii) Few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting provide minimal benefits in improving font recognition accuracy across different VLMs. (iii) Attention analysis sheds light on the inherent limitations of VLMs in capturing semantic features.'}

New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Responses were quantitatively assessed on a normalized scale from -2 (strongly Pro-China) to +2 (strongly Pro-U.S.) and categorized according to stance, neutrality, and refusal rates. The findings demonstrate significant and consistent ideological alignments correlated with the LLMs' geographic origins; U.S.-based models predominantly favored Pro-U.S. stances, while Chinese-origin models exhibited pronounced Pro-China biases. Notably, language and prompt framing substantially influenced model responses, with several LLMs exhibiting stance reversals based on prompt polarity or linguistic context. Additionally, we introduced comprehensive metrics to evaluate response consistency across languages and framing conditions, identifying variability and vulnerabilities in model behaviors. These results offer practical insights that can guide organizations and individuals in selecting LLMs best aligned with their operational priorities and geopolitical considerations, underscoring the importance of careful model evaluation in politically sensitive applications.

This limitation poisons large language models to correctly understand relationships between biological entities, such as molecules and diseases, or drug interactions, and further results in potential misinterpretation of biomedical documents. To address this issue, current approaches generally adopt the Synthetic Data Augmentation method which involves similarity computation followed by word replacement, but counterfactual data are usually generated. As a result, these methods disrupt meaningful word sets or produce sentences with meanings that deviate substantially from the original context, rendering them ineffective in improving model performance. To this end, this paper proposes a biomedical-dedicated rationale-based synthetic data augmentation method. Beyond the naive lexicon similarity, specific bio-relation similarity is measured to hold the augmented instance having a strong correlation with bio-relation instead of simply increasing the diversity of augmented data. Moreover, a multi-agents-involved reflection mechanism helps the model iteratively distinguish different usage of similar entities to escape falling into the mis-replace trap. We evaluate our method on the BLURB and BigBIO benchmark, which includes 9 common datasets spanning four major BioNLP tasks.

Thus, this study investigates the ethical awareness of LLMs in MI with multiple experiments. Our findings show that LLMs have a moderate to strong level of knowledge in MI.

For example, the model reasons that to "break down" visually complex spatial tasks, making a tool call to a Python interpreter to perform tasks (such as cropping, image segmentation, or saturation changes) would improve performance significantly. Our experimentation shows that explicitly evoking this "tool calling" call, via system-level XML $...\\texttt{<tool>} ... \\texttt{</tool>}...$ tags, can effectively flag Python interpreter access for the same language model to generate relevant programs, generating advanced multimodal functionality.

CoRanking first employs a small-size reranker to pre-rank all the candidate passages, bringing relevant ones to the top part of the list (\\eg, top-20). Then, the LLM listwise reranker is applied to only rerank these top-ranked passages instead of the whole list, substantially enhancing overall ranking efficiency. Although more efficient, previous studies have revealed that the LLM listwise reranker have significant positional biases on the order of input passages. Directly feed the top-ranked passages from small reranker may result in the sub-optimal performance of LLM listwise reranker. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a passage order adjuster trained via reinforcement learning, which reorders the top passages from the small reranker to align with the LLM's preferences of passage order. Extensive experiments on three IR benchmarks demonstrate that CoRanking significantly improves efficiency (reducing ranking latency by about 70\\%) while achieving even better effectiveness compared to using only the LLM listwise reranker."}

However, LLMs often fail to remain faithful to retrieved information. Mitigating this is critical, especially if LLMs are required to reason about the retrieved information. Recent research has explored training-free decoding strategies to improve the faithfulness of model generations. We present a systematic analysis of how the combination of the ReAct framework and decoding strategies (i.e., DeCoRe, DoLa, and CAD) can influence the faithfulness of LLM-generated answers. Our results show that combining an agentic framework for knowledge retrieval with decoding methods that enhance faithfulness can increase accuracy on the downstream Multi-Hop Question Answering tasks.

Understanding LLMs' knowledge deficiencies by exhaustively evaluating against full-scale knowledge bases is computationally prohibitive, especially for closed-weight models. We propose stochastic error ascent (SEA), a scalable and efficient framework for discovering knowledge deficiencies (errors) in closed-weight LLMs under a strict query budget. Rather than naively probing all knowledge candidates, SEA formulates error discovery as a stochastic optimization process: it iteratively retrieves new high-error candidates by leveraging the semantic similarity to previously observed failures. To further enhance search efficiency and coverage, SEA employs hierarchical retrieval across document and paragraph levels, and constructs a relation directed acyclic graph to model error propagation and identify systematic failure modes. Empirically, SEA uncovers 40.7x more knowledge errors than Automated Capability Discovery and 26.7% more than AutoBencher, while reducing the cost-per-error by 599x and 9x, respectively.

This paper introduces a novel approach called Cocktail, which employs chunk-adaptive mixed-precision quantization to optimize the KV cache. Cocktail consists of two modules: chunk-level quantization search and chunk-level KV cache computation. Chunk-level quantization search determines the optimal bitwidth configuration of the KV cache chunks quickly based on the similarity scores between the corresponding context chunks and the query, maintaining the model accuracy. Furthermore, chunk-level KV cache computation reorders the KV cache chunks before quantization, avoiding the hardware inefficiency caused by mixed-precision quantization in inference computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Cocktail outperforms state-of-the-art KV cache quantization methods on various models and datasets.'}

This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing CC/HPI/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model accuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes from the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven state-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when enhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical entities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics affecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note length, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing the time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many types of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the frequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and GatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest performance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model performance for certain entities.

PromptDistill identifies and retains the most informative tokens by leveraging attention interactions in early layers, preserving their hidden states while reducing the computational burden in later layers. This allows the model to focus on essential contextual information without fully processing all tokens. Unlike previous methods such as H2O and SnapKV, which perform compression only after processing the entire input, or GemFilter, which selects a fixed portion of the initial prompt without considering contextual dependencies, PromptDistill dynamically allocates computational resources to the most relevant tokens while maintaining a global awareness of the input. Experiments using our method and baseline approaches with base models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, Phi 3.5 Mini Instruct, and Qwen2 7B Instruct on benchmarks including LongBench, InfBench, and Needle in a Haystack demonstrate that PromptDistill significantly improves efficiency while having minimal impact on output quality compared to the original models. With a single-stage selection strategy, PromptDistill effectively balances performance and efficiency, outperforming prior methods like GemFilter, H2O, and SnapKV due to its superior ability to retain essential information. Specifically, compared to GemFilter, PromptDistill achieves an overall $1\\%$ to $5\\%$ performance improvement while also offering better time efficiency.

However, previous literature has also highlighted the bias embedded in language models, particularly around contentious topics such as potentially toxic content. This bias could result in labels applied by LLMs that disproportionately align with majority groups over a more diverse set of viewpoints. In this paper, we evaluate how LLMs represent diverse viewpoints on these contentious tasks. Across four annotation tasks on four datasets, we show that LLMs do not show substantial disagreement with annotators on the basis of demographics. Instead, the model, prompt, and disagreement between human annotators on the labeling task are far more predictive of LLM agreement. Our findings suggest that when using LLMs to annotate data, under-representing the views of particular groups is not a substantial concern.

First, we introduce a taxonomy to group the recent methods into two main categories: (a) explicit compact Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which reduces tokens while keeping the explicit reasoning structure, and (b) implicit latent CoT, which encodes reasoning steps within hidden representations instead of explicit tokens. Meanwhile, we discuss their strengths and weaknesses. Then, we conduct empirical analyses on existing methods from performance and efficiency aspects. Besides, we present open challenges in this field, including human-centric controllable reasoning, trade-off between interpretability and efficiency of reasoning, ensuring safety of efficient reasoning, and broader applications of efficient reasoning. In addition, we highlight key insights for enhancing LRMs' inference efficiency via techniques such as model merging, new architectures, and agent routers. We hope this work serves as a valuable guide, helping researchers overcome challenges in this vibrant field\\footnote{this https URL}."}

Recent work has explored decomposing such tasks into subtasks with independent contexts. However, some contextually related subtasks may encounter information loss during execution, leading to redundant operations or execution failures. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework with an interaction mechanism, which enables a subtask to query specific information or trigger certain actions in completed subtasks by sending requests. To implement interaction, we introduce a subtask trajectory memory to enable resumption of completed subtasks upon receiving interaction requests. Additionally, we propose a new action during execution, which generates a concise and precise description of execution process and outcomes of a subtask, to assist subsequent subtasks in determining interaction targets and requests. We evaluate our framework on interactive decision-making task WebShop and multi-hop question answering HotpotQA, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and comparison results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art training-free baselines.'}

To address these issues, we propose a pipeline that uses LLMs to construct a biomedical knowledge graph (BioStrataKG) from large-scale articles and builds a cross-document question-answering dataset (BioCDQA) to evaluate latent knowledge retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. We then introduce Integrated and Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning (IP-RAR) to enhance retrieval accuracy and knowledge reasoning. IP-RAR maximizes information recall through Integrated Reasoning-based Retrieval and refines knowledge via Progressive Reasoning-based Generation, using self-reflection to achieve deep thinking and precise contextual understanding. Experiments show that IP-RAR improves document retrieval F1 score by 20\\% and answer generation accuracy by 25\\% over existing methods.

However, training SMoE remains challenging due to the issue of representation collapse. Recent studies have focused on improving the router to mitigate this problem, but existing approaches face two key limitations: (1) expert embeddings are significantly smaller than the model's dimension, contributing to representation collapse, and (2) routing each input to the Top-K experts can cause them to learn overly similar features. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Robust Sparse Mixture of Experts via Stochastic Learning (S2MoE), which is a mixture of experts designed to learn from both deterministic and non-deterministic inputs via Learning under Uncertainty. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate that S2MoE achieves performance comparable to other routing methods while reducing computational inference costs by 28%."}

Quick thinking usually relies on pattern matching rather than truly understanding the query logic, which misses proper understanding. To address these issues, we propose FReM: Flexible Reasoning Mechanism, a method that adjusts reasoning depth according to the complexity of each question. Specifically, FReM leverages synthetic reference QA examples to provide an explicit chain of thought, enabling efficient handling of simple queries while allowing deeper reasoning for more complex ones. By doing so, FReM helps quick-thinking models move beyond superficial pattern matching and narrows the reasoning space for slow-thinking models to avoid unnecessary exploration. Experiments on seven QA datasets show that FReM improves reasoning accuracy and scalability, particularly for complex multihop questions, indicating its potential to advance LCQA methodologies.'}

In detail, the proposed method constructs a dataset that captures instances of copyrighted infringement cases by the targeted LLM. With the dataset, we unlearn the content from the LLM by means of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which replaces the verbatim copyrighted content with plausible and coherent alternatives. Since DPO may hinder the LLM's performance in other unrelated tasks, we integrate gradient projection and Fisher information regularization to mitigate the degradation. We validate our approach using a large-scale dataset of 500 famous books (predominantly copyrighted works) and demonstrate that SUV significantly reduces verbatim memorization with negligible impact on the performance on unrelated tasks. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and public benchmarks confirm the scalability and efficacy of our approach, offering a promising solution for mitigating copyright risks in real-world LLM applications."}

In building function classification (BFC), tweets are often collected using geographic heuristics and labeled via external databases, an inherently weakly supervised process that introduces both label noise and sentence level feature noise (e.g., irrelevant or uninformative tweets). While label noise has been widely studied, the impact of sentence level feature noise remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of clean benchmark datasets for controlled analysis. In this work, we propose a method for generating a synthetic oracle dataset using LLM, designed to contain only tweets that are both correctly labeled and semantically relevant to their associated buildings. This oracle dataset enables systematic investigation of noise impacts that are otherwise difficult to isolate in real-world data. To assess its utility, we compare model performance using Naive Bayes and mBERT classifiers under three configurations: real vs. synthetic training data, and cross-domain generalization. Results show that noise in real tweets significantly degrades the contextual learning capacity of mBERT, reducing its performance to that of a simple keyword-based model. In contrast, the clean synthetic dataset allows mBERT to learn effectively, outperforming Naive Bayes Bayes by a large margin. These findings highlight that addressing feature noise is more critical than model complexity in this task. Our synthetic dataset offers a novel experimental environment for future noise injection studies and is publicly available on GitHub.'}

This is a manual process that is highly dependent on the specific story-generation task. Motivated by the recent success of applying RL with Verifiable Rewards to domains like math and coding, we propose a general story-generation task (Next-Chapter Prediction) and a reward formulation (Verified Rewards via Completion Likelihood Improvement) that allows us to use an unlabeled book dataset as a learning signal for reasoning. We learn to reason over a story's condensed information and generate a detailed plan for the next chapter. Our reasoning is evaluated via the chapters it helps a story-generator create, and compared against non-trained and supervised finetuning (SFT) baselines. Pairwise human judgments reveal the chapters our learned reasoning produces are preferred across almost all metrics, and the effect is more pronounced in Scifi and Fantasy genres."}

Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions.

This avoids the substantial cost and effort required for data distillation. To verify the effectiveness of Rec-R1, we evaluate it on two representative tasks: product search and sequential recommendation. Experimental results demonstrate that Rec-R1 not only consistently outperforms prompting- and SFT-based methods, but also achieves significant gains over strong discriminative baselines, even when used with simple retrievers such as BM25. Moreover, Rec-R1 preserves the general-purpose capabilities of the LLM, unlike SFT, which often impairs instruction-following and reasoning. These findings suggest Rec-R1 as a promising foundation for continual task-specific adaptation without catastrophic forgetting.'}

Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior.

Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional "individual" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results.

By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding."}

Specifically, Agent4RSs introduces memory mechanisms that enable the agents to autonomously learn and self-evolve from real-world interactions. However, to the best of our knowledge, how robust Agent4RSs are remains unexplored. As such, in this paper, we propose the first work to attack Agent4RSs by perturbing agents' memories, not only to uncover their limitations but also to enhance their security and robustness, ensuring the development of safer and more reliable AI agents.\nGiven the security and privacy concerns, it is more practical to launch attacks under a black-box setting, where the accurate knowledge of the victim models cannot be easily obtained. Moreover, the practical attacks are often stealthy to maximize the impact. To this end, we propose a novel practical attack framework named DrunkAgent. DrunkAgent consists of a generation module, a strategy module, and a surrogate module. The generation module aims to produce effective and coherent adversarial textual triggers, which can be used to achieve attack objectives such as promoting the target items. The strategy module is designed to `get the target agents drunk' so that their memories cannot be effectively updated during the interaction process. As such, the triggers can play the best role. Both of the modules are optimized on the surrogate module to improve the transferability and imperceptibility of the attacks. By identifying and analyzing the vulnerabilities, our work provides critical insights that pave the way for building safer and more resilient Agent4RSs. Extensive experiments across various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DrunkAgent."}

Despite this, we observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs. Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance. The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably.

One popular approach to assess correctness is to evaluate software on tests. If a test fails, it indicates a fault in the software under test; if all tests pass correctly, one may assume that the software is correct. However, the reliability of these results depends on the test suite considered, and there is a risk of false negatives (i.e. software that passes all available tests but contains bugs because some cases are not tested). Therefore, it is important to consider error-inducing test cases when evaluating software.\nTo support data-driven creation of such a test-suite, which is especially of interest for testing software synthesized from large language models, we curate a dataset (Codehacks) of programming problems together with corresponding error-inducing test cases (i.e., "hacks"). This dataset is collected from the wild, in particular, from the Codeforces online judge platform.

We first collect existing publications which implemented semantic-preserving transformations and share their implementation, such that we can reuse them. We empirically study the effectiveness of three different ensemble strategies for enhancing defect detection tools. We apply the collected transformations on the Devign dataset, considering vulnerabilities as a type of defect, and two fine-tuned large language models for defect detection (VulBERTa, PLBART). We found 28 publications with 94 different transformations.\nWe choose to implement 39 transformations from four of the publications, but a manual check revealed that 23 out 39 transformations change code semantics. Using the 16 remaining, correct transformations and three ensemble strategies, we were not able to increase the accuracy of the defect detection models.

Recent studies demonstrate their potential to generate useful, personalized responses when provided with patient-specific health information that encompasses lifestyle, biomarkers, and context. As LLM-driven health applications are increasingly adopted, rigorous and efficient one-sided evaluation methodologies are crucial to ensure response quality across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, personalization and safety. Current evaluation practices for open-ended text responses heavily rely on human experts. This approach introduces human factors and is often cost-prohibitive, labor-intensive, and hinders scalability, especially in complex domains like healthcare where response assessment necessitates domain expertise and considers multifaceted patient data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics: an evaluation framework that streamlines human and automated evaluation of open-ended questions by identifying gaps in model responses using a minimal set of targeted rubrics questions. Our approach is based on recent work in more general evaluation settings that contrasts a smaller set of complex evaluation targets with a larger set of more precise, granular targets answerable with simple boolean responses. We validate this approach in metabolic health, a domain encompassing diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Our results demonstrate that Adaptive Precise Boolean rubrics yield higher inter-rater agreement among expert and non-expert human evaluators, and in automated assessments, compared to traditional Likert scales, while requiring approximately half the evaluation time of Likert-based methods.

To address these challenges, we propose SPIO (Sequential Plan Integration and Optimization), a novel framework that leverages LLM-driven decision-making to orchestrate multi-agent planning across four key modules: data preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and hyperparameter tuning. In each module, dedicated planning agents independently generate candidate strategies that cascade into subsequent stages, fostering comprehensive exploration. A plan optimization agent refines these strategies by suggesting several optimized plans. We further introduce two variants: SPIO-S, which selects a single best solution path as determined by the LLM, and SPIO-E, which selects the top k candidate plans and ensembles them to maximize predictive performance.

Yet, the main training paradigm remains: contrastive learning with binary relevance labels and the InfoNCE loss, where one positive document is compared against one or more negatives. This objective treats all documents that are not explicitly annotated as relevant on an equally negative footing, regardless of their actual degree of relevance, thus (a) missing subtle nuances that are useful for ranking and (b) being susceptible to annotation noise. To overcome this limitation, in this work we forgo real training documents and annotations altogether and use open-source LLMs to directly generate synthetic documents that answer real user queries according to several different levels of relevance. This fully synthetic ranking context of graduated relevance, together with an appropriate list-wise loss (Wasserstein distance), enables us to train dense retrievers in a way that better captures the ranking task. Experiments on various IR datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms conventional training with InfoNCE by a large margin. Without using any real documents for training, our dense retriever significantly outperforms the same retriever trained through self-supervision.

The second is tied to position, even if the dot product between a key and query is highly negative (i.e. an irrelevant key) learned positional biases may unintentionally up-weight such information - dangerous when distances become out of distribution. Put together, these two failure cases lead to compounding generalisation difficulties. We test whether they can be mitigated through the combination of a) selective sparsity - completely removing irrelevant keys from the attention softmax and b) contextualised relative distance - distance is only considered as between the query and the keys that matter. We show how refactoring the attention mechanism with these two mitigations in place can substantially improve generalisation capabilities of decoder only transformers.'}

In this paper, we introduce Mixture of Latent Experts (MoLE), a novel parameterization methodology that facilitates the mapping of specific experts into a shared latent space. Specifically, all expert operations are systematically decomposed into two principal components: a shared projection into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by expert-specific transformations with significantly reduced parametric complexity. This factorized approach substantially diminishes parameter count and computational requirements. Beyond the pretraining implementation of the MoLE architecture, we also establish a rigorous mathematical framework for transforming pre-trained MoE models into the MoLE architecture, characterizing the sufficient conditions for optimal factorization and developing a systematic two-phase algorithm for this conversion process. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrates that MoLE significantly enhances computational efficiency across multiple dimensions while preserving model representational capacity. Empirical evaluations corroborate our theoretical findings, confirming that MoLE achieves performance comparable to standard MoE implementations while substantially reducing resource requirements.'}

Ghandour', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23083', 'abstract': 'Foundation models have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI), offering remarkable capabilities across multi-modal domains. Their ability to precisely locate objects in complex aerial and satellite images, using rich contextual information and detailed object descriptions, is essential for remote sensing (RS). These models can associate textual descriptions with object positions through the Visual Grounding (VG) task, but due to domain-specific challenges, their direct application to RS produces sub-optimal results. To address this, we applied Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) techniques to adapt these models for RS-specific VG tasks. Specifically, we evaluated LoRA placement across different modules in Grounding DINO and used BitFit and adapters to fine-tune the OFA foundation model pre-trained on general-purpose VG datasets. This approach achieved performance comparable to or surpassing current State Of The Art (SOTA) models while significantly reducing computational costs. This study highlights the potential of PEFT techniques to advance efficient and precise multi-modal analysis in RS, offering a practical and cost-effective alternative to full model training.'}

We review the growing body of work in this area and provide a research agenda. Agentic LLMs are LLMs that (1) reason, (2) act, and (3) interact. We organize the literature according to these three categories. The research in the first category focuses on reasoning, reflection, and retrieval, aiming to improve decision making; the second category focuses on action models, robots, and tools, aiming for agents that act as useful assistants; the third category focuses on multi-agent systems, aiming for collaborative task solving and simulating interaction to study emergent social behavior. We find that works mutually benefit from results in other categories: retrieval enables tool use, reflection improves multi-agent collaboration, and reasoning benefits all categories. We discuss applications of agentic LLMs and provide an agenda for further research. Important applications are in medical diagnosis, logistics and financial market analysis. Meanwhile, self-reflective agents playing roles and interacting with one another augment the process of scientific research itself. Further, agentic LLMs may provide a solution for the problem of LLMs running out of training data: inference-time behavior generates new training states, such that LLMs can keep learning without needing ever larger datasets. We note that there is risk associated with LLM assistants taking action in the real world, while agentic LLMs are also likely to benefit society.'}

Approaches to scaling AI supervision include debate, in which two agents engage in structured dialogue to help a judge evaluate claims; critique, in which models identify potential flaws in proposed solutions; and prover-verifier games, in which a capable 'prover' model generates solutions that must be verifiable by a less capable 'verifier'. Evaluations of the scalability of these and similar approaches to difficult problems benefit from datasets that include (1) long-form expert-verified correct solutions and (2) long-form flawed solutions with annotations highlighting specific errors, but few are available.\nTo address this gap, we present FindTheFlaws, a group of five diverse datasets spanning medicine, mathematics, science, coding, and the Lojban language. Each dataset contains questions and long-form solutions with expert annotations validating their correctness or identifying specific error(s) in the reasoning. We evaluate frontier models' critiquing capabilities and observe a range of performance that can be leveraged for scalable oversight experiments: models performing more poorly on particular datasets can serve as judges/verifiers for more capable models. Additionally, for some task/dataset combinations, expert baselines exceed even top model performance, making them more beneficial for scalable oversight experiments."}

Abdelfattah, Diana Marculescu', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22879', 'abstract': 'State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms several state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\\times$ and 3$\\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: this https URL.'}

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve "level-0" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.'}

We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice."}

The results show the responsiveness of programmes to innovations in translation technology, with increased compulsory inclusion of machine translation, post-editing, and quality evaluation, and a rapid response to the release of generative tools. The flexibility required during the Covid-19 pandemic has also led to some lasting changes to programmes. While the range of tools being taught has continued to expand, programmes seem to be consolidating their core offering around cloud-based software with cost-free academic access. There has also been an increase in the embedding of professional contexts and workflows associated with translation technology. Generic file management and data security skills have increased in perceived importance, and legal and ethical issues related to translation data have also become more prominent.

Similar to other challenges in market design, understanding this trade-off is constrained by limited access to real-world data, leading researchers and practitioners to turn to simulation frameworks. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers a novel approach to simulations, providing human-like reasoning and adaptability without necessarily relying on explicit assumptions about agent behavior modeling. Despite their potential, existing frameworks have yet to integrate LLM-based agents for studying information asymmetry and signaling strategies, particularly in the context of auctions. To address this gap, we introduce InfoBid, a flexible simulation framework that leverages LLM agents to examine the effects of information disclosure strategies in multi-agent auction settings. Using GPT-4o, we implemented simulations of second-price auctions with diverse information schemas. The results reveal key insights into how signaling influences strategic behavior and auction outcomes, which align with both economic and social learning theories. Through InfoBid, we hope to foster the use of LLMs as proxies for human economic and social agents in empirical studies, enhancing our understanding of their capabilities and limitations. This work bridges the gap between theoretical market designs and practical applications, advancing research in market simulations, information design, and agent-based reasoning while offering a valuable tool for exploring the dynamics of digital economies.'}

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have provided unprecedented opportunities for improving aviation communication transcription tasks. OpenAI's Whisper is one of the leading automatic speech recognition models. However, fine-tuning Whisper for aviation communication transcription is not computationally efficient. Thus, this paper aims to use a Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning method called Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune a more computationally efficient version of Whisper, distil-Whisper. To perform the fine-tuning, we used the Air Traffic Control Corpus dataset from the Linguistic Data Consortium, which contains approximately 70 hours of controller and pilot transmissions near three major airports in the US. The objective was to reduce the word error rate to enhance accuracy in the transcription of aviation communication. First, starting with an initial set of hyperparameters for LoRA (Alpha = 64 and Rank = 32), we performed a grid search. We applied a 5-fold cross-validation to find the best combination of distil-Whisper hyperparameters. Then, we fine-tuned the model for LoRA hyperparameters, achieving an impressive average word error rate of 3.86% across five folds. This result highlights the model's potential for use in the cockpit."}
