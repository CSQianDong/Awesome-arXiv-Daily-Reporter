Shapes are remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly, asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect, situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses, modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.'}

This motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.'}

Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows."}

Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches. The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to produce an IIS.'}

However, applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem, a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs, like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought, In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial optimization problems with preferential constraints.'}

The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.'}

To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility, outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks while ensuring robust privacy."}

With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes, embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis."}

We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final mapping.

We show that this is partly due to the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction, whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the model\'s on-policy chain-of-thought traces.

It allows LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs. InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting 13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.'}

To overcome these limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework, called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the semantic patterns of the original graph.

Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.'}

During the process, they often re-derive the same intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise, reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model\'s own metacognitive analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook" which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to conclude.'}

This is especially evident in efforts to digitize historical Black newspapers, where inconsistent typography, visual degradation, and limited annotated layout data hinder accurate transcription, despite the availability of various systems that claim to handle optical character recognition (OCR) well. In this short paper, we present a layout-aware OCR pipeline tailored for Black newspaper archives and introduce an unsupervised evaluation framework suited to low-resource archival contexts. Our approach integrates synthetic layout generation, model pretraining on augmented data, and a fusion of state-of-the-art You Only Look Once (YOLO) detectors. We used three annotation-free evaluation metrics, the Semantic Coherence Score (SCS), Region Entropy (RE), and Textual Redundancy Score (TRS), which quantify linguistic fluency, informational diversity, and redundancy across OCR regions. Our evaluation on a 400-page dataset from ten Black newspaper titles demonstrates that layout-aware OCR improves structural diversity and reduces redundancy compared to full-page baselines, with modest trade-offs in coherence.

Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample. Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary. Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25, +4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the next wave of progress in LLM reasoning."}

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

The problem arises from the real world requirement of optimizing the disaster response/preparedness time and minimizes the route duration of the vehicles to achieve the solution with the minimum highest-vehicle-route-duration. Multiple diversely-functional vertices are considered including the concept of Transhipment Ports as inter-modal resource transfer stations. Both simultaneous and split pickup and transferring of different types of delivery and pickup cargo is considered, along with Vehicle-Cargo and Transhipment Port-Cargo Compatibility. The superiority of the proposed cascaded minimization approach is shown over existing makespan minimization approaches through the developed MILP formulation. To solve the problem quickly for practical implementation within Disaster Management-specific Decision Support Systems, an extensive Heuristic Algorithm is devised. The Heuristic utilizes Decision Tree based structuring of possible routes and is able to inherently consider the compatibility issues. Preferential generation of small route elements are performed, which are integrated into route clusters; we consider multiple different logical integration approaches, as well as shuffling the logics to simultaneously produce multiple independent solutions. Finally perturbation of the different solutions are done to find better neighbouring solutions.

The encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck, B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain, high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability.

To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.

Recent advances in diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality tabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive information. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by determining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied in images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains underexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited record diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack specifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs errorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target records, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are predicted.

Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities.

Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.

To this end, digital twins offer a valuable solution for OOD detection. Thus, we present a digital twin-based approach for OOD detection (ODiSAR) in SARs. ODiSAR uses a Transformer-based digital twin to forecast SAR states and employs reconstruction error and Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty quantification. By combining reconstruction error with predictive variance, the digital twin effectively detects OOD behaviors, even in previously unseen conditions. The digital twin also includes an explainability layer that links potential OOD to specific SAR states, offering insights for self-adaptation. We evaluated ODiSAR by creating digital twins of two industrial robots: one navigating an office environment, and another performing maritime ship navigation. In both cases, ODiSAR forecasts SAR behaviors (i.e., robot trajectories and vessel motion) and proactively detects OOD events. Our results showed that ODiSAR achieved high detection performance -- up to 98\\% AUROC, 96\\% TNR@TPR95, and 95\\% F1-score -- while providing interpretable insights to support self-adaptation.'}

In this work, a large-scale model, fusion masked auto-encoder (FusionMAE) is pre-trained to compress the information from 88 diagnostic signals into a concrete embedding, to provide a unified interface between diagnostic systems and control actuators.

Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry."}

The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

First, we add news data and multilingual pairs for LLM pretraining to bridge the data gap. Based on this, we propose a cross-lingual retrieval dataset that enables the LLM to better integrate embeddings across different languages. Second, whereas LLMs use a causal mask with token-level loss, embedding models use a bidirectional mask with sentence-level loss. This training gap makes full fine-tuning less effective than LoRA. We introduce a soft-masking mechanism to gradually transition between these two types of masks, enabling the model to learn more comprehensive representations. Based on this, we propose a dynamic hard negative mining method that exposes the model to more difficult negative examples throughout the training process.

However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge for practical and socially appropriate task execution."}

To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.

As resilience, robustness, and well-being are required in anti-fragile manufacturing and human-centric societal tasks, an autonomous anticipation and adaption to thermal saturation and burns due to motors overheating become instrumental for human safety and robot availability. Robots are thereby expected to self-sustain their performance and deliver user experience, in addition to communicating their capability to other agents in advance to ensure fully automated thermally feasible tasks, and prolong their lifetime without human intervention. However, the traditional robot shutdown, when facing an imminent thermal saturation, inhibits productivity in factories and comfort in the society, while cooling strategies are hard to implement after the robot acquisition. In this work, smart digital twins endowed with generative AI, i.e., variational autoencoders, are leveraged to manage thermally anomalous and generate uncritical robot states. The notion of thermal difficulty is derived from the reconstruction error of variational autoencoders. A robot can use this score to predict, anticipate, and share the thermal feasibility of desired motion profiles to meet requirements from emerging applications in Industry 6.0 and Society 6.0.'}

Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis. Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves (i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional rule-based detection systems."}

Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free, class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes. In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix (FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability (retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge)."}

While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries.

This paper introduces an age of information (AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO satellites and ground terminals. Our three-layer design employs hybrid free-space optical (FSO) links for high-capacity satellite-to-HAP communication and reliable radio frequency (RF) links for HAP-to-ground transmission, and thus addressing the temporal discontinuity in LEO satellite coverage while serving diverse user priorities. Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the AoI and satellite handover frequency through optimal transmit power distribution and satellite selection decisions.

However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS).

Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.'}

As a result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR) method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance, run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.'}

While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views, then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.'}

Recently, time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However, existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs, computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations. Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, which contains 250 univariate time series.

The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model.

Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal."}

Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting the strong adaptability achieved by our method.'}

This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3) Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Pattinson', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12531', 'abstract': "In visuomotor policy learning, the control policy for the robotic agent is derived directly from visual inputs. The typical approach, where a policy and vision encoder are trained jointly from scratch, generalizes poorly to novel visual scene changes. Using pre-trained vision models (PVMs) to inform a policy network improves robustness in model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). Recent developments in Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) suggest that MBRL is more sample-efficient than MFRL. However, counterintuitively, existing work has found PVMs to be ineffective in MBRL. Here, we investigate PVM's effectiveness in MBRL, specifically on generalization under visual domain shifts. We show that, in scenarios with severe shifts, PVMs perform much better than a baseline model trained from scratch. We further investigate the effects of varying levels of fine-tuning of PVMs. Our results show that partial fine-tuning can maintain the highest average task performance under the most extreme distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that PVMs are highly successful in promoting robustness in visual policy learning, providing compelling evidence for their wider adoption in model-based robotic learning applications."}

With the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization, and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions.'}

However, due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast, optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adap- tation (termed SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance. Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images, generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source samples with target-like dis- tributions, minimizing negative transfer. Meanwhile, a Feature- Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with calibrated tar- get pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.'}

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019, synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets (SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN. From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline. Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440 for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99 range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.'}

Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the SB to various image classification tasks.\nIn this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the target task."}

We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.

Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen.

Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters. However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.'}

Earlier "refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned, nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B, and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace. The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs deployment in security-sensitive domains.'}

To shed light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.'}

Despite these changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes, leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also achieves a 98.9\\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and realistic power grid scenarios.'}

We present \\textbf{TinyServe}, a lightweight and extensible serving system for deploying tiny LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA, GPT2-345M) with support for structured KV sparsity, plugin-based token selection, and hardware-efficient attention kernels. Unlike prior simulation frameworks, TinyServe executes real-time decoding with configurable sparsity strategies and fine-grained instrumentation.\nTo reduce decoding cost, we introduce a \\textit{query-aware page selection} mechanism that leverages bounding-box metadata to estimate attention relevance between the query and KV cache blocks. This enables selective KV loading with minimal overhead and no model modifications. Our fused CUDA kernel integrates page scoring, sparse memory access, and masked attention in a single pass.\nExperiments show that TinyServe achieves up to \\textbf{3.4x} speedup and over \\textbf{2x} memory savings with negligible accuracy drop. Additional analysis of cache reuse, page hit rate, and multi-GPU scaling confirms its practicality as an efficient system-level design for LLM training and inference research on resource-constrained hardware.'}

Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.'}
