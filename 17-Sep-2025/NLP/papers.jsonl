This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such activation verbalization approaches actually provide privileged knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets are not ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the activations of the target LLM being decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs.'}

ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints.

To address these challenges, we introduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human research process. The planner operates in a dynamic cycle, iteratively interleaving evidence acquisition with outline optimization to produce a comprehensive, source-grounded outline linking to a memory bank of evidence. The writer then executes a hierarchical retrieval and writing process, composing the report section by section. By performing targeted retrieval of only the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively mitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art across major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearchGym.

In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through interactions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios.

While prior work has simulated LLM "personas" using discrete Big Five labels on social media data, the alignment of LLMs with continuous, ground-truth personality assessments derived from natural interactions is largely unexamined. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark comprising semi-structured interview transcripts paired with validated continuous Big Five trait scores. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate LLM performance across three paradigms: (1) zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini, (2) LoRA-based fine-tuning applied to both RoBERTa and Meta-LLaMA architectures, and (3) regression using static embeddings from pretrained BERT and OpenAI\'s text-embedding-3-small.

Chain-of-thought prompting offers minimal gains over zero-shot, suggesting that personality inference relies more on latent semantic representation than explicit reasoning.

As a result, their effectiveness and robustness remain limited. We propose HSAD (Hidden Signal Analysis-based Detection), a novel hallucination detection framework that models the temporal dynamics of hidden representations during autoregressive generation. HSAD constructs hidden-layer signals by sampling activations across layers, applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency-domain representations, and extracts the strongest non-DC frequency component as spectral features. Furthermore, by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LLMs, HSAD identifies optimal observation points for effective and reliable detection.

Existing methods mainly focus on (1) using LLMs as policies to interact with the environment through generating low-level feasible actions, and (2) utilizing LLMs to generate high-level tasks or language guides to stimulate action generation. However, the former struggles to generate reliable actions, while the latter relies heavily on expert experience to translate high-level tasks into specific action sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce the Plan with Language, Act with Parameter (PLAP) planning framework that facilitates the grounding of LLM-based agents in long-horizon environments. The PLAP method comprises three key components: (1) a skill library containing environment-specific parameterized skills, (2) a skill planner powered by LLMs, and (3) a skill executor converting the parameterized skills into executable action sequences.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel "bottom-up," data-driven framework that inverts the conventional generation pipeline. Our approach is predicated on a "Retrieval-First for Knowledge, Clustering for Structure" strategy, which first establishes the "knowledge boundaries" of the source corpus before any generative planning occurs. Specifically, we perform exhaustive iterative retrieval from the knowledge base and then employ an unsupervised clustering algorithm to organize the retrieved documents into distinct "knowledge clusters." These clusters form an objective, data-driven foundation that directly guides the subsequent generation of a hierarchical outline and the final document content. This bottom-up process ensures that the generated text is strictly constrained by and fully traceable to the source material, proactively adapting to the finite scope of the knowledge base and fundamentally mitigating the risk of hallucination. Experimental results on both 14B and 32B parameter models demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art baselines, and is expected to demonstrate unique advantages in knowledge-constrained scenarios that demand high fidelity and structural coherence.

Strategies for encoding the sort of higher-concept information in images that would enable the resulting VLM model (CLEAR GLASS model) to have this capability to a greater degree. To this end, we introduce a grouped image-caption dataset (MAGIC), which consists of several groups of image captions and for each group a set of associated images and higher-level conceptual labels. We use a novel contrastive loss technique to induce the model to encode in the representation of each image (caption) in a group the information that is common to all members of the image-caption group. Our main contribution is a grouped contrastive loss function based on text-image contrastive groups (outer contrastive loss) as well as an inner loss which measures the distances between image-caption instances in the group. Our training methodology results in the CLEAR GLASS model having the concept abstraction capacity as an emergent capacity because the model is not exposed to the higher-level concepts associated with each group. Instead, the training forces the model to create for each image-caption group a semantic representation that brings it closer to the semantic representation of the higher-level concepts in the latent semantic space. Our experiments show that this training methodology results in a model which shows improvement in abstract concept recognition compared to SOTA models.'}

To address these limitations, we present HistoryBank, a multilingual database of 10M+ historical events extracted from Wikipedia timeline pages and article infoboxes. Our database provides unprecedented coverage in both historical depth and linguistic breadth with 10 languages. Additionally, we construct a comprehensive question answering benchmark for temporal reasoning across all languages. This benchmark covers a diverse set of 6 temporal QA reasoning tasks, and we evaluate a suite of popular language models (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9b, Qwen3-8B, GPT4o) to assess their performance on these tasks. As expected GPT4o performs best across all answer types and languages; Gemma-2 outperforms the other small language models.

Conventional content moderation classifiers, which are usually trained on text produced by humans, suffer from misclassifications due to LLM-generated text deviating from their training data and adversarial attacks that aim to avoid detection. Present-day defence tactics are reactive rather than proactive, since they rely on adversarial training or external detection models to identify attacks. In this work, we aim to identify the vulnerable components of toxicity classifiers that contribute to misclassification, proposing a novel strategy based on mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our study focuses on fine-tuned BERT and RoBERTa classifiers, testing on diverse datasets spanning a variety of minority groups. We use adversarial attacking techniques to identify vulnerable circuits. Finally, we suppress these vulnerable circuits, improving performance against adversarial attacks. We also provide demographic-level insights into these vulnerable circuits, exposing fairness and robustness gaps in model training. We find that models have distinct heads that are either crucial for performance or vulnerable to attack and suppressing the vulnerable heads improves performance on adversarial input. We also find that different heads are responsible for vulnerability across different demographic groups, which can inform more inclusive development of toxicity detection models.'}

MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios.

To address these issues, we first reveal the fundamental causes of the bias by identifying the knowledge boundaries of LLMs in strategy planning. Then, we propose an approach to mitigate the bias by reinforcement learning with a dual reward function, which optimizes strategy planning via both accuracy and entropy-based confidence for each region according to the knowledge boundaries.

If the behavior of LLMs can be intentionally steered toward specific ideological positions, such as political or religious views, then those who control these systems could gain disproportionate influence over public discourse. Although it remains an open question whether LLMs can reliably be guided toward coherent ideological stances and whether such steering can be effectively prevented, a crucial first step is to develop methods for detecting when such steering attempts occur. In this work, we adapt a previously proposed statistical method to the new context of ideological bias auditing. Our approach carries over the model-agnostic design of the original framework, which does not require access to the internals of the language model. Instead, it identifies potential ideological steering by analyzing distributional shifts in model outputs across prompts that are thematically related to a chosen topic. This design makes the method particularly suitable for auditing proprietary black-box systems. We validate our approach through a series of experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability and its potential to support independent post hoc audits of LLM behavior.'}

Moreover, existing cost analyses typically regulate only the number of sampling passes, while neglecting the substantial disparities in sampling costs introduced by different scaling strategies. In this paper, we systematically compare the efficiency of different test-time scaling strategies for ATP models and demonstrate the inefficiency of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source approaches. We then investigate approaches to significantly reduce token usage and sample passes while maintaining the original performance. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods that can be integrated into a unified EconRL pipeline for amplified benefits: (1) a dynamic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) switching mechanism designed to mitigate unnecessary token consumption, and (2) Diverse parallel-scaled reinforcement learning (RL) with trainable prefixes to enhance pass rates under constrained sampling passes.

Results show that the first pipeline, although simpler, achieves the best translation accuracy (10% BLEU, 21% chrF on Bayelemagaba), consistent with low-resource translation results.

This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control of model behavior.'}

While research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action, categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media. We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may depend on the format of the discussion.'}

SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8% accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction. Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware alignment strategies.'}

CC is a two-stage process: first, generating initial LLM responses using lower-tier, less constrained safety filters models, then refining them through higher-tier models that process both the preliminary output and original prompt. We evaluate our technique using 350 cybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\% after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per prompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more malicious and technically superior.

However, current RAG frameworks often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented. Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary model GPT-4o across all datasets.

When used as the final-layer activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions, and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the softmax.'}

One emerging field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient, effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First, mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database. Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer. Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.'}

While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.'}

Comparing with related methods, the proposed method entangles the watermark with the intrinsic parameters of the LLM, which better balances the robustness and imperceptibility of the watermark. Moreover, the proposed method enables us to extract the watermark under the black-box scenario, which is computationally efficient for use. Experimental results have also verified the feasibility, superiority and practicality. This work provides a new perspective different from mainstream works, which may shed light on future research.'}

In the context of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased.

This also sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives, and training can be conducted using small batch sizes.
