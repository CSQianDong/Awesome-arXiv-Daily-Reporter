{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2509.12635', 'title': 'Positional Encoding via Token-Aware Phase Attention', 'authors': 'Wang, Sheng Shen, RÃ©mi Munos, Hongyuan Zhan, Yuandong Tian', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12635', 'abstract': "We prove under practical assumptions that Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) introduces an intrinsic distance-dependent bias in attention scores that limits RoPE's ability to model long-context. RoPE extension methods may alleviate this issue, but they typically require post-hoc adjustments after pretraining, such as rescaling or hyperparameters retuning. This paper introduces Token-Aware Phase Attention (TAPA), a new positional encoding method that incorporates a learnable phase function into the attention mechanism. TAPA preserves token interactions over long range, extends to longer contexts with direct and light fine-tuning, extrapolates to unseen lengths, and attains significantly lower perplexity on long-context than RoPE families."}

However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \\textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \\textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \\textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.'}

Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined relationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly exhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite exploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing interaction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of prior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation, we propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and advantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned reasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three benchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of 4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO training. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a ReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on BrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web agents.'}
{'arxiv_id': 'arXiv:2509.12955', 'title': 'Automated Generation of Research Workflows from Academic Papers: A Full-text Mining Framework', 'authors': 'Heng Zhang, Chengzhi Zhang', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12955', 'abstract': 'The automated generation of research workflows is essential for improving the reproducibility of research and accelerating the paradigm of "AI for Science". However, existing methods typically extract merely fragmented procedural components and thus fail to capture complete research workflows. To address this gap, we propose an end-to-end framework that generates comprehensive, structured research workflows by mining full-text academic papers. As a case study in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain, our paragraph-centric approach first employs Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning with SciBERT to identify workflow-descriptive paragraphs, achieving an F1-score of 0.9772. Subsequently, we utilize Flan-T5 with prompt learning to generate workflow phrases from these paragraphs, yielding ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L scores of 0.4543, 0.2877, and 0.4427, respectively. These phrases are then systematically categorized into data preparation, data processing, and data analysis stages using ChatGPT with few-shot learning, achieving a classification precision of 0.958. By mapping categorized phrases to their document locations in the documents, we finally generate readable visual flowcharts of the entire research workflows. This approach facilitates the analysis of workflows derived from an NLP corpus and reveals key methodological shifts over the past two decades, including the increasing emphasis on data analysis and the transition from feature engineering to ablation studies. Our work offers a validated technical framework for automated workflow generation, along with a novel, process-oriented perspective for the empirical investigation of evolving scientific paradigms.
