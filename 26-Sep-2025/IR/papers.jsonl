However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes."}

However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%)."}

KD for recommender systems targets at distilling rankings, especially among items most likely to be preferred, and can only be computed on a small subset of items. Considering these features, we reveal the connection between CE loss and NDCG in the field of KD. We prove that when performing KD on an item subset, minimizing CE loss maximizes the lower bound of NDCG, only if an assumption of closure is satisfied. It requires that the item subset consists of the student's top items. However, this contradicts our goal of distilling rankings of the teacher's top items. We empirically demonstrate the vast gap between these two kinds of top items. To bridge the gap between our goal and theoretical support, we propose Rejuvenated Cross-Entropy for Knowledge Distillation (RCE-KD). It splits the top items given by the teacher into two subsets based on whether they are highly ranked by the student. For the subset that defies the condition, a sampling strategy is devised to use teacher-student collaboration to approximate our assumption of closure. We also combine the losses on the two subsets adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at this https URL."}

To address these challenges, we propose FORGE, a comprehensive benchmark for FOrming semantic identifieR in Generative rEtrieval with industrial datasets. Specifically, FORGE is equipped with a dataset comprising 14 billion user interactions and multimodal features of 250 million items sampled from Taobao, one of the biggest e-commerce platforms in China. Leveraging this dataset, FORGE explores several optimizations to enhance the SID construction and validates their effectiveness via offline experiments across different settings and tasks. Further online analysis conducted on our platform, which serves over 300 million users daily, reveals a 0.35% increase in transaction count, highlighting the practical impact of our method. Regarding the expensive SID validation accompanied by the full training of GRs, we propose two novel metrics of SID that correlate positively with recommendation performance, enabling convenient evaluations without any GR training.

One is to use bootstrapping of test sets, which, as we confirm, provides an estimate of variation in performance. For IR methods that rely on a seed, such as those that involve machine learning, another approach is to use a random set of seeds to examine performance variation. Using three different IR tasks we have used such randomness to examine a range of traditional statistical learning models and transformer-based learning models. While the statistical models are stable, the transformer models show huge variation as seeds are changed. In 9 of 11 cases the F1-scores (in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over 0.075; while 7 of 11 precision values (also in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over 0.125. This is in a context where differences of less than 0.02 have been used as evidence of method improvement. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of transformer models to training instabilities and moreover raise questions about the reliability of previous results, thus underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation practices.'}

Methods comprised a retrospective analysis of usage across web, iOS, and Android over 16 weeks (8 April-31 July 2025) and an in-product intercept survey. Usage metrics were drawn from web and app analytics with bot filtering. A client-side script randomized single-item prompts to approx. 10% of web sessions from a predefined battery assessing usefulness, reliability, and adoption intent. Proportions were summarized with Wilson 95% confidence intervals; free-text comments underwent thematic content analysis. iatroX reached 19,269 unique web users, 202,660 engagement events, and approx. 40,000 clinical queries. Mobile uptake included 1,960 iOS downloads and Android growth (peak >750 daily active users).

Real-world applications often face few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP), relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant, Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and training-free constraints."}

DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability.
